Tom Cruise in Cocktail!!
COCKTAIL
How many times have I watch this one?!
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM TOM!!!!!!!!!!
Unintentional camp and a very bad film!
Simple Plot. but surprisingly good
This Movie Is NOT An Advertisement For Alcoholics Anonymous!
As "Great-Awful" as "Plan 9 From Outer Space"!
Avoid
Definitly the worst big budget film in history.
Molotov cocktail please!
Cocktails Galore!
Awful
Whatever Were They Thinking
When Cruise was "Smokin'!!"
