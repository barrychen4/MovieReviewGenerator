The four movies included in this set -- 'Disorder In The Court', 'Malice In The Palace', 'Sing A Song Of Six Pants' and 'Brideless Groom' -- are in the public domain, which means anyone with recording equipment and a copy  of the movie can release their own video. Frequently, the results are of  poor video/audio quality (although the movies themselves are quite good --  'Brideless Groom' is one of the funniest Stooge comedies ever). Columbia  has just released an 'official' Stooges DVD (with six of the films on one  disc) -- hopefully the first of many. Stick with Columbia, and avoid these  cheap knock-offs.
Don't get me wrong, all four of these shorts are great, but haven't they been released enough? DISORDER IN THE COURT, MALICE IN THE PALACE, SING A SONG OF SIX PANTS, and BRIDELESS GROOM have been released on about fifty different videos, and now on DVD. BRIDELESS GROOM, SING A SONG, and DISORDER have been released in better quality by Columbia once or twice, but Shemp's most famous short MALICE IN THE PALACE is not on any Columbia Tristar collection yet. I like these shorts, but DVD's should be better that videos and need different shorts. After all, Columbia still hasn't released 55 of the Stooges films.
