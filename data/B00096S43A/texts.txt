This film has always been one of my favorites.<br /><br />I own three copies on VHS (two back-ups just in<br /><br />case the one I usually watch wears out). I make all of<br /><br />my friends watch it, and most of them love it as much as I do.<br /><br />It's stupid, completely inept, and totally hilarious. I put it up there with Richard Elfman's "Forbidden Zone" and John Paiz's "Crimewave" (A.K.A. "The Big Crimewave") as one of the three greatest cult movies of all time.<br /><br />Only problem is nobody has ever heard of this movie. So I couldn't believe my luck when I stumbled upon the DVD!!!<br /><br />I thought I was dreaming. I was tempted to buy three copies... just in case.<br /><br />First off, I watched the deleted scenes and extras,<br /><br />which were pretty great. It seemed odd, though, because<br /><br />I had already seen many of the deleted scenes (they are part of my VHS versions). Then, when I settled in to watch the movie, my heart was broken.<br /><br />Somebody, in their infinite wisdom, decided to<br /><br />censor out almost all of the nudity, and many other<br /><br />scenes have either been shortened,<br /><br />or are missing entirely.<br /><br />I suppose this version of the film might seem a little more<br /><br />competent, because the missing scenes may have slowed down the pacing of the movie a little, but the<br /><br />missing scenes were all PRICELESS. The ineptitude of this<br /><br />film is what made it special, and editing it down to a<br /><br />more "professional-feeling" version is borderline blasphemy.<br /><br />After seeing this edited and censored version, I wished I had never bought it at all. I wish it didn't even exist. Thank god for my VHS copies.<br /><br />Whoever decided to censor and edit this film should be<br /><br />ashamed of themselves. Thanks a lot for wrecking one of my favorite films. I only give it two stars because<br /><br />some of the extras are cool.
"It Came From Somewhere Else" has a place in my heart that no other movie does.  I first rented this movie back in 1989 when in was first out on VHS and it became no less than a religion to my friends and I.  We constantly quoted lines and watched it whenever we had parties.  It's a parody of many films, and I liken the humor to that of the television show Get A Life, with Chris Elliott.  It's sarcastic and clever, but has the underlying quirkiness of an inside joke that you don't quite get.  On top of it's clever comedy, it's also low budget enough to get a laugh at it's bad sets and props.<br /><br />As for the DVD release, bless the fine people at Xenon for putting it out, but I wish the version on the DVD was the version I saw on video.  Some scenes were deleted then made into "deleted" scenes on the DVD.  It seems like a ploy to get people to believe the deleted scenes are something extra.  The "lost footage" selection to me is more like the "deleted scenes".  Also I noticed some other small shots and bits cut out.  Little things, but to someone who holds this film on high and has such fond memories of watching it, I hate to see them gone.  I'm glad I still have an old VHS copy.  The full version of the secretary scene is hidden on the DVD, but some of these other shots are not there at all.<br /><br />All in all, this DVD is great.  It has more extra features than I'd ever imagine for this movie, and to see something "new" pertaining to this movie after so many years is truly amazing.  Just don't throw away any old copies of the movie you have.
I've enjoyed this movie almost as much as those who made it, many of whom are close personal friends.  Particular favorites are the doofy psychiatrist (it's impossible to believe that this guy could ever be a real doctor, but rumor has it he is), Mrs. VA who looks young and couquetish, and the Deputy who brought new meaning to the words "dumb-ass sidekick" and made me want to eat a goldfish or three.  If you watch closely, you can see all the stylistic touches of the director's assistant, Tim Johnson, that he demonstrated later as the executive producer of "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" including the excessive use of beefcake to entice female viewers, in this case the star, William VanArsdale (one of the finer pieces of manhood appearing on the big screen in the 1980s:  where is he now?)  His popcorn scene just ooozes sensuality.  Like a French pastry, you'll find "It Came From Somewhere Else" a tasty delight.
So, unfortunately, the movie itself went to the "chop shop" by those "Hollywood Types" who deleted some scenes from the DVD version of this movie, ostensibly to promote some sense of "coherency" for the viewer.  But, alas, incoherency was what made this film somewhat charming in the first place.  I understand, however, that the evisceration of the original was no fault of director Howard Hassler, whose untimely and sad incarceration prevented him from exercising personal control over the DVD production.<br />This DVD release, however, contains many extras never-before-seen or heard, including the highly recommended director's commentary including director Hassler, the reclusive actor William VanArsdale, and the incisive wit of film critic and private investigator Wilson "Max" Norris.  Check it out!  You will be glad you did... and if not, simply turn down the sound!<br />This execrable film... created by deservingly unemployed part-time actors, producers, directors and crew... maintains its status of perhaps the worst movie ever made, more than two decades after its initial theatrical release.  After viewing it, you may appreciate the part of your life you have saved by not viewing the deleted scenes on this DVD.
If you want glitzy special effects look elsewhere.  If you enjoy a good belly laugh from the absurd this may be your title.  One of those "cult" movies you will watch more than once.
Ive seen bad films, but this one takes the cake,,, unfunny, amateurish, boring and stupid actors.<br /><br />Looks like they wanted to make a bad movie like they used to make<br /><br />in the 50's....and failed.<br /><br />Shot in black and white with the gore and cheap sex scence in color.<br /><br />Even if they were shot in 3d it would not save the film.<br /><br />Please give me real moviemakers and send these low grade crappy actors/directors into the sunset....<br /><br />This film makes the Toxic Avenger series look good.......
