I found these movies to be extremely formulaic.  The plot wasn't all that bad though and seemed to at least move.  The most disappointing factor of all is that it's on DVD and the sound is terrible.  You can't understand  half of what they say.  It sounds like they recorded off of a bad speaker  that keeps popping.  At one point the film even scrolls.  Disappointing use  of media, okay plot, excellent for camp value.
Please realize that these b-westerns were made in the 1930's to be weekly entertainment.  We didn't have TV's and the movie was king.  However, times have changed.  Is this movie still worth watching?  Yes.<p>The Star Packer has one plot gimmick-a hollow tree trunk in the middle of a road in a western town. Once you accept the tree trunk, the movie is actually a decent movie. The story doe not bog down and keeps moving.  A westrern has to have some good horse riding in it, and there are some good western action scenes which includes a couple of horse chase scenes. If you like this movie, you might like another early Wayne movie titled &quot;Desert Trail.&quot;
