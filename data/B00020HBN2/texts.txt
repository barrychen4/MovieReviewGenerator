This is a great series even though i am not crazy about the english dubbed person who does Sailor Moon. I preferred the original voiced by Terri Hawkes and was sad she didnt return for the S & SuperS series. The new girl just sounds so crazy and unbareable. Anyways this is a great series and is really my favorite out of all 5 seasons. The story was on POINT and kept my interest every step of the way. The artwork is ok but not as gorgeous as season 4 & 5. This is must have as this season introduces the new sailor scouts, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto (Already revealed in season 2), and lastly Sailor Saturn makes her appearance in the final volume. Its such ashame these DVDs have been discontinued.
How come nobody reviewed this? This is the end of the heart snatcher arc, Kaorinite returns, Rini (chibi-usa) is kidnapped, and the fate of Sailors Saturn and Pluto are revealed. You should watch this!
