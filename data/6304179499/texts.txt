While people often gush -- and rightly so -- about the Charlie Brown Christmas and Halloween cartoons, I often feel like this is the "lost" Peanuts holiday special that doesn't quite get the attention of its more popular siblings.<p>Charlie Brown, through no fault of his own, gets roped into preparing a Thanksgiving dinner for Peppermint Patty and all his friends. And this from a boy who can barely make cold cereal and toast. Snoopy and Woodstock lend a hand in the kitchen with predictably silly results. <p>While it's not as iconic as some of the other Peanuts specials, it's a good story that really grasps the characters very well. This DVD also features "The Mayflower Voyages," one of several specials that cast the Peanuts characters as participants in American history. It's a good educational tool for the kids, mixing in some of the harsher facts of life at Plymouth Rock with the softer, happier mood of the Peanuts gang. Together, these two cartoons are well worth the DVD.
This video takes me back to being a kid and being able to stay up and watch the specials that came on TV for the holidays. This is just a great simple cartoon for kids and parents alike. You will never be disapointed  with any Charlie Brown cartoon. From Lucy's contant quest to never let  Charlie Brown never kick the football,to Charlie Browns deep thoughts on  life. You will always love this one.
This is a classic.  Even though Charles Schultz hated it when he first saw it, it has become one of the most beloved Charlie Brown caroons of all time.  People get very antsy if their networks don't put it on every year.  As usual, Charlie Brown has his trials and tribulations as he tries to prepare a Thanksgiving dinner for kids who have invited themselves to dinner.  Even Snoopy and the bird get into the act.<br /><br />This cartoon is great even for the little ones.  It doesn't matter if you are 3 or 93. It's a treat for the whole family.<br /><br />Enjoy it, Thanksgiving or any time of year!
Charlie Brown and friends are busy getting ready for that forgotten holiday - Thanksgiving.  Linus is telling everyone about it, Charlie Brown is wondering why the stores have Christmas decorations up already, and Sally is stressing about having to write a report on &quot;Standish Miles&quot; before she's finished her Halloween candy.  But then Peppermint Patty calls and invites herself, Marcy, and Franklin to the Brown house for Thanksgiving dinner.  Snoopy pitches in to help, but when the best they can do isn't enough for Peppermint Patty, what will happen next?<p>This is a Peanuts classic.  Only Charlie Brown could find himself in this predicament, and it's handled with the usual Peanuts gentle humor.<p>Also included on the DVD is an episode of the TV show &quot;This is America, Charlie Brown.&quot;  &quot;The Mayflower Voyage&quot; intersperses the Peanuts gang in a retelling of the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving.  It is a good presentation of the history of the Pilgrims, but is more history then entertainment.  Still, it does have its moments, like when Lucy wants directions to the complaint box once they've reached America.<p>The DVD offers no extras beyond this additional 25 minutes of Peanuts animation.  Still, the picture and sound quality are top notch on both programs.<p>This DVD belongs in any Peanuts fan's library to be enjoyed year after year.
If you're collecting Charlie Brown videos, you can't go wrong buying this package!  It's got 2 of Charles Schulz's best animated specials!<p>It's The  Great Pumpkin, Charlie brown (1966) was Charles Schulz's 3rd animated  special and features many of the most important elements of the Peanuts  cartoon strip: Charlie Brown trying to kick the football from Lucy (and you  can guess what happens!), Snoopy as the World War I Flying Ace, and of  course, Linus' unfleeting faith in the Great Pumpkin.  Sally is the only  one who is willing to sacrifice tricks or treats and the Halloween Party  for the Great Pumpkin's arrival.  Well, without giving away too many  details, let's just say neither Sally nor her older brother Charlie Brown  walk home with any Halloween candy.  However, when this special was  originally aired, Charles Schulz's office wound up with lots of candy to  give to poor old Charlie Brown. <p>A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (1973) won  an Emmy.  This time, Peppermint Patty invites herself and her friends to  Chuck's house for Thanksgiving while Charlie Brown is expected at his  grandmother's that same day.  With Linus and Snoopy's help, they make an  impromptu supper for their last-minute guests (though unconventional, as  Peppermint Patty complains: &quot;Where's the pumpkin pie, Chuck?&quot;).  Before the day is through, all of them learn a lesson of the true meaning  of Thanksgiving.
The Turkey-Day special is often forgotten about  due to the tremendous popularity of the Halloween &amp; Christmas specials but it is just as good and in some ways better.
The &quot;Peanuts&quot; TV specials changed the way I celebrate every holiday from Halloween to Arbor Day.  I raced home to watch &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; on ABC this year, having not seen it since 1994.  I watched it with wide eyes and, the next day, played the tape for my 19 month-old nephew, who learned the word &quot;Snoopy&quot; two weeks ago.<p>Even to my jaded almost-30 eyes, &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; absolutely rocks.  Peanuts TV specials lost a little charm when Vince Guaraldi passed on, but fortunately he scored this one.  There's a Woodstock-themed song performed by Jack Sheldon -- not as good as his &quot;Amendment Song&quot; for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (what is?), but it's hummable.<p>All the great &quot;Peanuts&quot; moments are here:  Lucy's one scene is a football gag; there's a lively remix of Guaraldi's &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; during the popcorn-and-toast montage; Snoopy climbs out of a mailbox and gets assaulted by a wayard deck chair (it's so *true*!).  Linus gives a great speech on the meaning of Chr -- I mean, Thanksgiving.  The jive handshake Franklin slips Charlie Brown is adorable in a 1973 kind of way.<p>My nephew was riveted to the screen for the Snoopy and Woodstock sequence, doubling over in laughter when the ping-pong table folded in half, taking Snoopy with it.  These five minutes pleased him so much that I reran that portion of the tape two more times.  He kept pointing to the screen and shouting &quot;Doopy!&quot; every fifteen seconds.<p>Not the best &quot;Peanuts&quot; holiday -- &quot;Christmas&quot; and &quot;Great Pumpkin&quot; are desert-island material -- but if it serves to get my nephew into a lifetime of Charles M Schulz worship, I'll call it the most valuable video in my collection.
The Charlie Brown holiday specials have been an institution since the 1960s, with the Thanksgiving episode produced in 1973.  Although arguably not as good as some of the other holiday episodes, such as Christmas and Halloween, the Thanksgiving special is still a great deal of fun.  The basic premise is silly but clever - Peppermint Patty invites herself to Charlie Brown's house (or Chuck as she calls him) for Thanksgiving dinner.  Being a pushover, Charlie cannot bring himself to tell her that he's going to his grandmother's house for Thanksgiving; thus, the basic premise of having no adult supervision is explained rather adroitly.  Charlie enlists the help of Snoopy and Linus to make a rather untraditional dinner.  Along the way, everyone learns a little about the origins of Thanksgiving, the true meaning of being thankful, and to be more sensitive of each other's feelings.  And it all comes with toast, jellybeans, and a bouncy song about Woodstock ("Little Bird").  Who could ask for more?
Yes, you read correctly:  three stars. Not five. Why, might you ask? Am I crazy? No, I am not. At least I don't think I am :)<p>I am a huge fan of Peanuts. Every year, I look forward to the holiday specials on television. A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING is one of them. Yet, I must admit: much like IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN and IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN, this show is kind of dated. I do still love it -- the characters and classic Peanuts gags we have all come to cherish. Not to mention having a great storyline. But truth be told, the timing between most of the dialogue is very very very offbeat (example:  towards the beginning, when Charlie Brown, Linus and Sally are conversing on the sidewalk, they sound like robots; and their timing is way off.  During one instance, Linus stops talking, and there is a two or three second pause before Sally starts yelling.  I mean, it's like, "Where did that come from?" LOL)).<p>And Peppermint Patty's voice -- that's just annoying.<p>Yet I still love them. There is just something about these shows that we can all relate to again and again. Yes, the later films, tv shows and specials are all better drawn, and the timing is a lot better; and some have a much smoother feel.<p>But these, I think, contain a certain nostalgic feeling. And that's why they are "classics."<p>I realize that some fans may be angry with this review; that I am somehow insulting Charles Schulz.  But, you know what? I am sure even he would agree, if he saw the Thanksgiving show now, that, say, episodes from his mastefully done Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show or the NASA special is more smooth-flowing and the timing is better.<p>Before you click "no" under this review, watch the Thanksgiving show again. You'll see what I mean by boring pauses in between much of the dialogue.<p>I am not being mean here.  I love Charles Schulz, and am just being perfectly honest about how I feel. And while A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING is a true, honest-to-God classic, it is not one of the greatest holiday specials ever made.
Charlie Brown Thanksgiving has all the fun that you normally expect of a Charlie Brown movie.  You get to see Peppermint Patty invite herself and several friends to Charlie Brown's house for Thanksgiving, and then watch him flounder about trying to deal with it.  The result is a dinner of junk food ala carte.  <p>Charlie Brown Thanksgiving DVD also comes with a second feature, Voyage of the Mayflower.  This is a really great little flick that presents the Charlie Brown characters as participants in the pilgrim's voyage to the new world, their struggle to survive, and the first Thanksgiving.  Parents may appreciate the educational aspects of this flick, as well as enjoy it's excellent quality.<p>Between the two features, A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is definitely value for money.  Another great feature, because the features are only 30 minutes, they can work as a great stop-gap to occupy a child for a brief period (such as while you are finishing dinner and they are getting fidgety), without having to cut short a full length movie.
This is one of the better Peanuts videos. A solid story, excellent score, not seeming too rushed or too drawn out. Adults can enjoy this one with the kids.
What I like about the Charlie Brown cartoons is that they're totally child-centered.  Adults are so insignificant that they're not seen at all and when they're heard, they make this weird "Ma hwa ma hwa hwa" sound.<br /><br />In this episode, Charlie Brown, with the help of snoopy and his bird pal, help make Thanksgiving dinner for his friends (all because pushy Peppermint Patty bulldozed her way into an invite).<br />It's funny, when I was a kid, I assumed Peppermint Patty was a boy because Marcie called her "sir" and because she dressed like a boy and had a gruff voice.  It wasn't until this movie where she's blatantly flirting with Charlie Brown that I realized she's actually a girl.<br />Anyway, my favorite parts of this movie are when Snoopy is making the "meal" for the group.  It's totally a meal that a kid would conjure up and I also liked how he serves the plates like a dealer serving cards.<br /><br />I really liked Marcie in this movie because she's the only one who stands up to Peppermint Patty.  Charlie Brown is too timid and even Linus backs down, too.<br />And Snoopy is funny as always.  He's kind of bi-polar in that he can be smiling one moment, then frowning, growling, acting proper, then laughing again.  What a crack up!  This cartoon still makes me laugh out loud today.<br /><br />This movie comes with a bonus movie called "Mayflower Voyage" that is educational, but also very boring.  Charlie Brown and his friends don't have much dialogue with each other and instead, you just hear a voice-over running off facts.  The character voices are also different, too.<br />So, 5 stars for "Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving" and one star taken off for the dud "Mayflower Voyage".
A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is twenty-five minutes long and was originally aired on November 20, 1973. This was the third holiday special with A Charlie Brown Christmas being the first and It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown being second. With the exception of the football scene where Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown, Lucy is not featured in the rest of the special. The main story is that Peppermint Patty has invited herself, Marcie, and Franklin to Chuck's house for Thanksgiving Dinner and Charlie Brown and Sally will be at their grandmother's condo that day. Linus comes up with the idea of having two Thanksgiving Dinners; one for Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Franklin, and the other at his grandmother's place. The plan goes into full effect and the two recruit Snoopy to help set up the table chairs and make dinner. The two funny scenes are when Snoopy gets into a fight with a folding deckchair that comes to life and the kitchen scene where Woodstock accidently put butter on Snoopy's ear. The gang arrives and is escorted to the backyard to be seated for dinner. Look for chair that disappears and reappears next to Franklin whenever the scene cuts back and forth. In the end Charlie Brown's grandmother invites Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Franklin, and Linus over to her place and Charlie Brown emerges as the hero at the end. Not quite up to par with the first two, but still a good Peanuts special. A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving gets an AAA+++.<br /><br />Also included in this DVD is the The Mayflower Voyagers. The Mayflower Voyagers is twenty-four minutes and originally aired on October 21, 1988. The Mayflower Voyagers was the first of an eight part special called This is America, Charlie Brown. The bulk of the Mayflower Voyagers is done in narration by Charlie Brown. There are a few dialogues done by Lucy, Linus, Sally, Peppermint Patty, and Marcie. Also included in this special are adults, in full view, with actually speaking parts and not the blah, blah we usually hear on other specials. This was something of a rarity in the Peanuts specials. Basically The Mayflower Voyagers tells the story of the Pilgrims journey to the new world, their hardships, and the meetings of friendly Indians. This would be a good lesson for pre-school kids. The Mayflower Voyagers gets an AAA+++.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Play<br />Set Up<br />Scene Selection<br />Main Menu
Thanksgiving is not really something that is acknowledged and certainly not something that is celebrated in Scotland, but I watch this TV special every year in the run up to Xmas just to get me in the mood. The cartoon begins with the usual gag where Lucy yanks the football away from Chuck. I guess he'll never learn to distrust women, eh.<br /><br />But his main grief in this one is the fact that all of his friends invite themselves over to his place for Thanksgiving despite the fact he's going to his grandmother's for the celebration. Snoopy and Woodstock work together (and against each other) to prepare a slapdash dinner including toast, jelly beans and popcorn. Needless to say the rest of the Peanuts gang are far from impressed with the menu, though that doesn't stop Peppermint Patty putting the moves on Chuck.<br /><br />All this talk of food has made me hungry.<br /><br />An episode from "This is America, Charlie Brown" is also featured in which the Peanuts gang recreate the famous Mayflower Voyage and trials and perils of the passengers and crew as they make their way to the new world. Having never studied this in school I never knew what Thanksgiving was about other than eating a turkey. This episode details all the main parts of the story and is quite a history lesson.<br /><br />It's a natural companion piece to A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving as is obvious by it's inclusion on the DVD. But for all of you non-American people who don't fully understand the holiday perhaps you should watch this first.<br /><br />I don't get why the starving passengers didn't just eat Woodstock though.<br /><br />A self-congratulatory 12-minute documentary is also included.
I recently checked out the remastered DVD version of the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, which was the third of the three holiday cartoons created back in the 1970s: the Christmas and the Halloween (Great Pumpkin) cartoons.<br /><br />This short cartoon was drawn by creator Charles Schultz ("Sparky") and was like watching one of his newspaper strips come to life.  There was no grand message, no alien invasion, no potty humor or Steven Spielberg-ish special effects.<br /><br />A charming story of Charlie Brown getting talked into having a dinner that Peppermint Patty forced herself to be invited.  And a bunch of her friends, too.  Rather than talk her out of it ("you can't talk Peppermint Patty into anything", he complains) he decides to make a Thanksgiving dinner for them before going to his grandmother's house for their family thanksgiving.<br /><br />Snoopy's fight with the lawn chair was not part of the story but was fun to watch.  The shocked look on the kids' faces when they were served buttered toast, pretzel sticks, jellybeans and a large helping of popcorn was priceless.<br /><br />A great story for little kids.  I'm afraid Pixar has made me jaded, sadly.<br /><br />Another interesting story is Peanut's take on The Mayflower Story.  Sure, historically inaccurate but fun to see and get a flavor of what Thanksgiving is really all about.  It's not about the food, it's about the people (if there is a message here, that is it).<br /><br />Finally, a trailer promoting several other DVDs coming out soon and a "making of" that has the original child voice actors, now grown up, discussing their experiences with Lee Mendelssohn and so on.<br /><br />Overall, a nice package.  Clean, bright color, great sound and that awesome Vince Giraldi musical score will take you back.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />[From Wiki:]<br /><br />Film Credits<br />Written and Created by Charles M.

I purchased this dvd for a niece & nephew for Christmas.  I contacted their parents to select a movie that they thought the little ones would enjoy--and they selected Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving.  Their mom sent me an email to thank me & to let me know that the kido's loved the movie & had watched it several times already--and the parents enjoyed it too. Afterall, who wouldn't love a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving!!!
This is number two in the Peanuts' specials Big Three (need I mention the other two?), and I think all the other reviews have covered beautifully all the things that need to be said about it.  Except this: the music is fantastic!  Vince Guaraldi is at his best, and even sings on the amazing "Little Birdie." The theme song alone is worth it.<br /><br />Really, I don't know what I'm doing writing a review of this. Unless you've lived under a rock, you've already seen it, and unless you have no soul, you love it, too.  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
I owned Charlie Brown Thanksgiving in VHS and recently converted to DVD.  I asked my grandchildren if they wanted me to replace Charlie Brown Thanksgiving in DVD and they all said YES!.  It's a classic at our house and they often borrow it to take home and watch.  It's one of those movies that they enjoy over and over again.  It's great fun for the whole family.  We all watch it together at least once a season.
This review is dedicated to Brooke Shields. (In her book, she said Thanksgiving is one of her favorite holidays.)<br /><br />We may have to watch this a few times before we really understand how great it is. It's basically this. Charlie Brown and Sally are planning to go to their grandmother's house for Thanksgiving. Then Peppermint Patty, calls Charlie and says she is coming along with Marcy and Franklin to Charlie Brown's for Thanksgiving. Poor Charlie can't seem to get a word in edgewise to explain that he won't even be home. So, Linus (being on the smarter side) says to just make a quick supper for Patty, Marcy, and Franklin. (This turns out to be toast, popcorn, pretzels, and jelly beans.) Peppermint Patty gets angry when she sees the supper, but then feels bad and apologizes. (With some help from her back up conscience Marcy.) The whole gang is then invited to Charlie Brown's grandmother's for supper.<br /><br />While this may seem to be a simple story, it is actually quite profound. Over time, a holiday (be it Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter) can develop a string of customs. And in following the established customs, we forget the TRUE ESSENCE of the holiday and what it is really about. Thanksgiving is about being thankful for things we have. And as Marcy puts it: "We should just be thankful for being together." And even though Charlie and Linus could not put together a traditional or normal supper, they did the best they could under the circumstances. That's what was really important.<br /><br />Overall, this is a short, but profound story that tells us we must not forget the true essence of a day because we get lost in the established customs.
It's Charlie Brown and Snoopy! Who doesn't love a classic, holiday, fun video.  A great video to bring back memories and create new ones with your children.
The song "Little Birdie" is worth the price of the disc alone.<br /><br />The extra bonus feature in which the Peanuts charaters re-create the journey of the Mayflower and the first Thanksgiving, which I'd never seen before, was surprisingly sweet and very informative for my kids.<br /><br />Get this DVD (along with Christmas and Halloween) to complete your collection of childhood holiday memories....
I have to say that this is a Thanksgiving tradition where we watch this on TV and I just bought the DVD and we can watch it on our own time during the thanksgiving season.  I love it when snoopy is cooking the thanksgiving dinner and get into a fight with the law chair.  The bonus feature "The Mayflower Voyage" is educational but boring.  I still give it 5 stars
In this 1973 addition to Charles Schulz's line of Peanuts classic holiday specials, Charlie Brown has a grand Thanksgiving dinner to look forward to at his grandmother's house, but a call from tomboyish friend Peppermint Patty throws a wrench in his plans. She's invited herself over to Charlie Brown's house for a holiday feast, and she's bringing Marcie and Franklin along too! Charlie Brown doesn't know how he let himself get talked into making a pre-dinner dinner for his friends, but now he'll need the help of Linus, Snoopy, and Woodstock to pull it off! Unfortunately, all they know how to make is a meal of toast, popcorn, pretzels, jelly beans, and ice-cream sodas!<br /><br />The Peanuts holiday specials have been American traditions ever since they first started appearing back in the 1960s, and they've been a personal tradition for as far back as I can remember. Some of them are as necessary to complete the holiday experience as jack o' lanterns, eggs, turkeys, and Christmas trees. The most popular of these are the sacred '60s Christmas and Halloween specials, but not too far behind are the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, Valentine's, and Easter offerings. In fact, "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving" is probably considered number 3 in the countdown, if such a countdown exists. The special is classic Peanuts and highly enjoyable and heartwarming entertainment for a holiday that is sadly short on themed programming, though it doesn't have quite as much "magic" as the other two specials. Surely, this is partly due to the fact that Thanksgiving, while no doubt having a much deeper meaning than food, is essentially celebrated through a big feast with family and friends. Christmas is all that and much more, and Halloween, well, Halloween is weird and spooky, and that's why it's so cool. It's clearly much harder to come up with a 25 minute TV special revolving around such a simple, though still wonderful, holiday as Thanksgiving. There are, of course, more critical factors as to why this shining television special doesn't shine quite as brightly as its predecessors. First and foremost, though she does appear for the brief football kicking gag in the opening of the special, Lucy's sassy presence is greatly missed throughout the rest of the program. Instead, we get Peppermint Patty, who doesn't really appeal to everyone, but who became a powerful presence in subsequent Peanuts shows. Second, there probably should have been a couple of touches added to enhance the Thanksgiving feeling of the film. Perhaps a scene of watching a parade on television or enjoying a REAL Thanksgiving meal at the kids' table at grandma's in the finale would have done the trick. We also have a change of voices this time around, and there aren't as many characters as the previous specials have had, which makes the Peanuts world a bit smaller and hurts the overall look a bit I think. Luckily, we do get the wisdom of Linus and Marcie, Woodstock makes his mark on the Peanuts holiday specials (with his own song to boot), and the entire experience is still an endearing one that we can all be thankful for.<br /><br />I considered making this a 4 star review for a moment, after taking in everything I just wrote, but two things have stopped me from bringing it down a notch from a 5. First, this special is still outstanding entertainment, definitely excellent five-star material. Maybe not as grand as the Christmas or Halloween specials, but it's still grand nevertheless. Second, "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving" on DVD comes with only one bonus feature, but it is an excellent one. It is, specifically, an entire 24-minute second program entitled, "This Is America, Charlie Brown: The Mayflower Voyagers." Now, this is probably mostly of interest to the history buff Peanuts fan. Part of the "This Is America, Charlie Brown" series from 1988 (which I don't remember well but wish would come to DVD in a boxed set someday), this is more educational programming than Peanuts magic, but it's sweet and entertaining educational programming. In the special, Charlie Brown and co. play the roles of pilgrim children aboard the Mayflower. The film takes us through the hardships the pilgrims suffered and introduces us to the leaders, both pilgrim and Native American alike, that helped bring them through the difficult times. It all culminates in the first Thanksgiving feast and is an excellent film to watch annually before your big holiday dinner. Together with the feature program, this is the "must have" DVD for Thanksgiving Day viewing, and it is perfect for that period after the Macy's parade but before dinner is on the table! Pick it up with the "Garfield Holiday Celebrations" DVD today!
Remember Marcie? The bespectacled girl who's so in awe of the tomboyish Patty that she calls her Sir? Patty, who's long worshipped her "Chuck" from afar blows it bigtime when she invites herself, Marcie and Franklin to a Thanksgiving dinner--and then finds fault with Charlie Brown and Snoopy's culinary talents with toast, pretzels and jellybeans. After her host leaves the table in humiliation, Marcie politely but firmly runs her "mentress" through a reality check. Marcie gets 5 stars for gumption and diplomacy here, but the moral of the story is if you're so overbearing that you invite yourself to dinner, don't critique the menu.
A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving never has gained quite the classic status as the Halloween or Christmas specials but this one is still great fun and how many Thanksgiving specials are there anyway?<br /><br />Peppermint patty invites herself and several others to Charlie Brown's house for Thanksgiving.  Problem is that Charlie is going to his Grandmas for dinner.  Well, ol' Chuck just can't turn them down so he enlists Snoopys aid to throw togehter a quick feast of junk food causing Peppermint Patty to blow her top.<br /><br />Grandma saves the day and has Charlie bring all the kids to her house for dinner.  At home, Snoopy and Woodstock hold their own Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />A pretty good Peanuts holiday special.  Charles Schultz, Peanuts creator, is no longer with us but it's good he was around long enough to see that his creation had become a national phenomenon!
Watched these every year when my son was a child have not lost their appeal after all these years, purchased it for my grandson.
The movie arrived very fast and was packaged very nicely. The movie was in perfect condition and my family enjoyed it very much
The cover describes the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving for modern times, which is a classic, but also on the DVD is the Mayflower version of the Charlie Brown History series, which is educational and entertaining.  It's a good combo, especially for young kids.
This movie had a fun little story in it and a wonderful education video about the voyage to America and the first Thanksgiving.  It includes names of actual people like Squanto and Miles Standish.  I actually bought the video for that reason.  It becomes a living text book!
This Charlie Borwn Thanksgiving DVD is so much fun for kids. You get tow DVDs. The fist one shows Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving dinner at home with self invited friends. The second DVD was my favorite though. This one shows Charlie Brown and his little friends traveling with the Pilgrims across the Atlantic Ocean on the Mayflower. This was not only fun, but very educational. We had read the story of Thanksgiving on a book, and when we saw the video on TV, I knew we aboslutely had to have it! So for me this was the best purchase!
I am so glad that I ordered this movie for my class. They loved it because who doesn't love Charlie Brown and Snoopy!? You can't go wrong with a classic for: NO foul language, no inappropriate parts for kids, and a warm storyline to boot!
Loved this movie ever since I was a kid and finally bought it.  Just as I remembered:  popcorn popping everywhere, toast flying in the kitchen,the fight with the chair and the true meaning of Thanksgiving.  The Mayflower "story" after makes a nice added feature.
What you can you say about the characers created by Charles M. Schultz, they are classics.  Is this the perfect special no, but it doesn't mean that they aren't part of the perfection of Peanuts world.  Kid friendly with fun for parents who remember whent the world was a simpler place.  Capture a tie to that simpler world with the joy that is Charlie Brown.
Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and the rest of the peanuts gang are back for another holiday.<br /><br />Thanksgiving is coming and Charlie Brown is getting ready to go to his grandmother's house for Thanksgiving dinner.  But, just as he's getting ready to leave, Peppermint Patty calls and invites herself over.  To make matters worse, she ends up bringing Franklin and Marcy along, too.  Charlie Brown now must make dinner for his friends before he can go to his grandmother's house.  He enlists the help of Linus, Snoopy, and Woodstock.  Snoopy is in charge of setting up the tables and chairs, while Linus and Charlie Brown get started on the food (toast, popcorn, jelly beans, and pretzels).  Needless to say, Peppermint Patty is pretty upset with the food, but Linus takes some time to describe the real meaning of Thanksgiving.  Charlie Brown's grandmother saves the day by inviting everyone to her house for a real Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Charlie Brown holiday specials since I was little.  I couldn't wait for them to come on TV.  It's nice to be able to share these timeless shows with my own children.  They enjoy watching Lucy pull the football away just as Charlie Brown is ready to kick it, and Snoopy planting wet kisses on Lucy.  I've always enjoyed hearing Linus' message about the "true" meaning of the holiday, too.<br /><br />This DVD contains another special about the Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock that is very good, too.<br /><br />I give this DVD my highest recommendation.  Peanuts specials have been and will continue to be timeless classics, and "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving" is no exception.  Don't miss this funny special that contains a useful message.
I remember every year seeing this and the Garfield special. Some very special times now that I am a 31 year old kid and passing on these traditions on to my 6 year old. I can't wait for it to come in!
This came in great shape in the mail.  It is your classic Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Show that you see on TV every year!!!  All ages can enjoy this movie together!
It's the classic Charlie Brown Thanksgiving...no surprises there.  Afterward, however, is a bonus feauture which I really enjoyed.  It's another 30-min (?) movie based on facts related to the Mayflower Voyage and the Pilgrim's first Thanksgiving, all with the Charlie Brown characters in it.  Well done!
What can you say about this classic. It is a good family cartoon that will appeal to the yoougest child all the way to the oldest person in the room. The story from beggining to end brings back memories when I was a child.
I decided to watch a series of old classics on DVD and gravitated to the Charlie Browns right away. This was not only due to my loving them as a kid but also due to the big biography on Charles Schulz's life that just got released. There's an innocence about these videos one seldom feels from contemporary specials. Unquestionably, the Peanuts series are a joy to re-experience. Furthermore, there is something incredibly non-PC about the dynamics of these characters. The over-the-top manipulative ways of Peppermint Patty and Lucy are not something producers would depict today. The same is true of Marcie's habit of calling Peppermint Patty "Sir." Saying grace before dinner would not do in a 2007 film either. Snoopy is a little aggressive for our new tastes. His pop gun musket would earn him a 10 day mandatory suspension were he to take it to school with him today. Not to mention that neither the beagle nor anyone else would dare to put butter on toast as he does here. Ah, the good old days may be gone but you can savor them once again with Charlie Brown.
What a wonderful classic - it takes me back to my childhood days! Of course, we didn't have DVD's (or VHS for that matter!) so whenever this great movie came on t.v. it was a BIG event! I make it special for my kids too - watching it at night with JIFFY POP popcorn, just like the good ol' days! I also think you get a GREAT DEAL on Amazon - it is the best price I've found AND if you spend $40, shipping is FREE! GREAT DEAL and a GREAT MOVIE! EnJoY!
Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, and the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving was something I looked forward to every year.  It cracks me up when Peppermint Patty invites herself and a bunch of people over then gripes about the food.  However, Charlie Brown saving the day by bringing his buddies over to Grandma's house is a good reminder of how to be a true friend.
I love him! He's always so annoyed and fed up with things. A bit like me!!<br /><br />nd I smiled. But I laughed more.<br /><br />The "chemistry" between Charlie and Peppermint Patty is one to see. And Marcie saying stuff like, "Stop holding my hand, Charlie Brown." and other things to fire Patty up!<br /><br />And the grandma and teachers speaking in the, "Wo Wo Wo Wo" language provides a few laughs also!<br /><br />I loved it. I laughed so hard when Patty was disappointed with the "meal" that Snoopy prepared for everyone. "Popcorn? Buttered toast!!? Where are the mashed potatoes???!"<br /><br />There are fewer cartoons as good as this here.<br /><br />5+ stars.<br /><br />Love ya, Charlie Brown!!<br /><br />&lt;3
This is a classic, so you'll get pretty much what you'd expect.  Except for one thing...  there is another Thanksgiving episode on the DVD that isn't really appropriate for very young children and isn't even that entertaining for older ones.  It's a very sober account of the first Thanksgiving, complete with suffering and starving Pilgrims and their misconceptions of American Indians. It's an accurate history lesson, yes, but if you're looking for Snoopy and the gang to entertain you, ignore the 'Bonus' track.
A hilarious slice of pure Americana. Nowhere does it get better than with the penultimate of American comics, PEANUTS. Charles Schulz does it again with the PEANUTS gang in this video. Shear fun will be had by children and adults alike watching this video as the PEANUTS gang learns the meaning of Thanksgiving. Watch for the battle between Snoopy and the lawn chair. Hysterical!
This is a winner.<br /><br />Charlie Brown gets roped into preparing a Thanksgiving dinner by a pushy Peppermint Patty who invites herself and a few friends over to "Chuck's" place for the holiday meal.  Time constraints restrict Chuck to a haphazard snack of pretzels and popcorn - great football food, but not for a festive holiday get-together.  Peppermint Patty, Marcie and Franklin all make their debuts into the Peanuts animations on this.<br /><br />Linus explains the origin of Thanksgiving as a feast initiated by Pilgrims and Indians for the purpose of giving thanks - a fact reiterated by Marcie after Patty rebukes poor Chuck for the food preparations.  Great message.<br /><br />An added bonus is the Mayflower in which the cartoon does not softsoap the hardships of the Pilgrims in their quest for a new opportunity for religious freedom in an unknown land that at times was quite unforgiving.  Also explains the role a few native Americans had in helping these people.  I certainly learned something new from this.<br /><br />And, for the football fans, you can play this DVD for the kids during the NFL games' halftime stuff.
Very good holiday program. I have them all. I grew up really enjoying all Charlie Brown shows, now my kids are enjoying them as well.
It's Thanksgiving, and Charlie Brown is supposed to spend this day at his Grandmother's. Before he can leave, however, Peppermint Patty decides she wants &quot;Chuck&quot; to host a Thankgiving dinner of his own, on the spur of the moment, and only hours before he must go to his Grandmother's. She invites herself, and her friends, to this meal.<p>With hardly any time to prepare for this feast, Charlie Brown throws together whatever he can find in the kitchen; none of which represents a true Thankgiving meal. No turkey, pumpkin pie, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, etc.<p>When Peppermint Patty and her firnds arrive, they are dismayed to find that the main course turns out to be popcorn of all foods. She lays into Charlie Brown, scorning him for not knowing how to put together a Thankgiving meal, until he feels so ashamed he trudges away into the house, defeated and embarrassed.<p>It is here that Linus explains to Peppermint Patty and everyone else the true meaning of Thankgiving, and how sorely Patty has Treated Charlie Brown. <p>&quot;A Charlie Brown Thankgiving&quot; is another Charles Shultz classic. Shultz has always had the ability to intertwine humor with positive, uplifting moral messages. And in this Peanuts classic, are hearts are warmed with this Thankgiving message. We are even no longer mad at Peppermint Patty for all the ill will she has caused poor Charlie Brown; for she has learned the message as well, and we can forgive her in the spirit of Thankgiving.<p>Whether you watch &quot;A Charlie brown Thankgiving&quot; on VHS or DVD, you will be in for a rewarding and delightful experience you can share with your family again and again. These kinds of classics never become dull or stale.
Though not as good as the two previous CB specials, it's still waayyy better than anything after it. "Little Birdy" is cool and sounds like it should have been a Lou Rawls number. But, where is Lucy? And Marcie is so cute! When I saw this on TV this year, didn't the Snoopy, Woodstock, pumpkin pie epilogue used to be with a turkey instead of the pie? Changed to unindict Woodstock from being cannabalist? Hmmmm.
The Chuckster is really in a jam this time! Somehow, he got railroaded into fixing a Thanksgiving feast for his Peanuts pals. This is a guy who can barely boil water! But Charlie B doesn't fret. He and Snoopy and Woodstock manage to pull it off -- in a way. The "way" involves an amazing assortment of junk food.  The kind of repast just about every Tom, Dick, and Carlos must have dreamed about digging into when they were little Tommies, Dickies, and Carlitos. Popcorn, pretzel sticks, buttered toast, jellybeans and sundaes. THIS Thanksgiving feast is a little kid's fantasy! So what does sassy tomboy Peppermint Patty do? She complains, that's what! She really lights into our zig-zag-shirted hero, calling him every synonym for "blockhead" ever thought of, and poor Charlie, understandably, has a severe case of Hurt Feelings (Miss Patty definitely needs to go rent some manners here!) Then Linus says that T-Giving isn't about the bird and the fixin's, but about being close to those you care for, while Patty apologizes to Our Hero for making all those snide remarks.<br />  A laugh-filled, heartwarming delight that I think that every Tom, Dick, and Carlos should see -- and not just the Tommies, Dickies  and Carlitos either! This is a feast of fun for everyone, young and old -- and everywhere in-between!
It came in great condition and in a prompt way.  Thanks
In this speical the peanuts gang are clebrating Thanksgiving. Charlie Brown (Todd Barbee) is going to his grandmother's house for Thanksgiving dinner. But then Lucy Van Pelt decides to invite herself to Charlie Brown's house for dinner. And keeps calling back with more kids that are coming to Charlie Brown's house for dinner. But the problem is that Lucy doesn't know that Charlie Brown is not going to be home for Thankgiving dinner. She doesn't even give Charlie Brown even time to tell her that he is going to his grandmother's for dinner. So Linus comes with an idea, Charlie Brown will have a dinner with Lucy and the other guests that are comiong and afterwords, he will go over to his grandmother's house. You can buy this by itself or you can buy it in a tree pack (the other two are It's the Great Pumkin Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Christmas).
A classic that we watch every Thanksgiving.  Five stars belongs to "A Charlie Brown Christmas" and this does not come near the quality, so only four stars.
I LOVE these Peanuts animations, but the sound is terrible. The thing that glues all the Charlie Brown features together is the Vince Guaraldi soundtracks, which are the third dimension to all the Peanuts specials -- and are arguably better than the animation itself. Alas, in all these "remastered" and unremastered DVD versions of the Peanuts classics, whoever mastered them was no musician: all the low end is gone, the lyrical background figures lost to lameness. Remastered means REMASTERING ALL OF IT, including the soundtrack, bringing all the details into sharp relief. There's none of that here, or in any of the Peanuts DVDs. What we're left with is so sterile and soulless, as all DVDs and CDs sound, that I've started collecting the VHS versions. The only way to watch these classics in their original state is via ancient, fading video tapes which preserve the original analog warmth and fidelity. I should note that I'm a professional musician, so my ear and musical memory are superior. If you're average, you won't be able to tell the difference. If you're a musician, you're gonna be disappointed.
