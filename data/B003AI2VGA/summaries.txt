"There Is So Much Darkness Now ~ Come For The Miracle"
Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production
This movie needed to be made.
distantly based on a real tragedy
"What's going on down in Juarez and shining a light on it"
Pretty pointless fictionalization
This is junk, stay away
