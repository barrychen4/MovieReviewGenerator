Tenchi Muyo! is one of those legendary anime productions that continues to live on in the minds of fans. Essentially a fairy tale and a coming-of-age story, the plot revolves around the seemingly simple Tenchi who inexplicably finds himself surrounded by a bevy of beautiful alien women. Naturally, zany adventure and epic danger quickly ensue. For many, this now common "harem" style of anime was their first introduction to the art form during a time when it was still a rare commodity. And for most, the series' cast of lovable, fascinating, and unforgettable characters still remain indelibly etched onto their hearts.<br /><br />The franchise is also a complicated one, with various alternate versions of the original series spanning nearly all forms of media, including television, manga, video games, and even novels. Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki - Box Set The Complete Series is the much anticipated seven episode continuation of the original OVA (original video animation, or direct-to-video) animated series, although fans expecting to find the show's earlier thirteen episodes will not find them here.<br /><br />Misleading monikers aside, these newest installments to the Tenchi canon serve as perfect examples of how not to resurrect a series. After a thirteenth episode that ended on a rather inconclusive note, fans, after years of waiting, naturally imagined the new installments would contain the same heartfelt romantic intrigue, epic battles, and zany shenanigans associated with the earlier productions. Instead, they received seven boring, nearly humorless episodes that revolved around characters not even present in the earlier stories. Below are some of my more detailed complaints, but beware of spoilers:<br /><br />Remember Ryoko, the awesome space pirate? She's now a weak, ineffectual whiner. Remember Noike and Misau? Of course not, because they weren't in the earlier episodes, but they dominate these. Remember the awesome battles in the climactic sixth episode? Not one is worth mentioning this time around. Remember wondering what Tenchi's mother must have been like? Well, you got your wish--she was a half-deluded prankster who enjoyed toying with Tenchi through trickery and gags. Remember thinking Yosho was an unmarried widower? Well, turns out he's actually married to a Jurain woman that he sees, hmmm, virtually never. Remember thinking Lady Seto, the Devil Princess of Jurai, must really be a force to be reckoned with? Nah, she's just a harmless, somewhat frail woman. Remember looking forward to a climactic showdown with the Goddess Tokimi? Never happens, turns out she just wants to be friends! Remember wondering about the identity of the Counter-Actor? Of course not, she never existed or was even hinted at in the earlier stories, nor is she well explained in these. And, of course, here's the biggest one--Which girl does Tenchi choose? Apparently, he will someday marry all of them! *sigh*<br /><br />Couple all these complaints with just average animation and shaky writing, and you have what is possibly the worst continuation of a beloved series anyone could have ever conjured up. The show's only slightly redeeming quality is that certain long-held questions regarding some of the characters are finally resolved or explained (but whether anyone likes those "answers" is a different story).<br /><br />The entire Tenchi Muyo franchise is special. Seek out the earlier episodes (known as Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki OVA 1 and 2), check out the TV series Tenchi Universe (and its excellent sequel movies, Tenchi Muyo in Love and Tenchi Forever), and seek out Hitoshi Okuda's brilliant No Need for Tenchi manga novels. But as for the episodes in this set, they will only make you cry.
Vol. 4 of the Tenchi OAV's is arguably one of the best tapes in the entire series, just for having &quot;The Night Before the Carnival&quot; on it, and more specifically, the very naughty, very kyoot, Nurse Washu! and the  infamous &quot;Magic Fingers&quot; scene. While the dub version is well  done, they heavily censor this scene and the translations turn out *very*  different, making the sub version a must have for any serious Tenchi fan,  although it's not exactly appropriate for younger viewers. That aside, both  versions are hilarious as always, and are worthy of even the most cursory  anime fan's dollars. Go get it!
We get to see more Pretty Sammy!  This time she has to use her magical powers agains an evil monopolist software titan Biff Standard (seems alot like Bill Gates) who wants to take over the world with his operating System (Microsoft Windows). Of course, her nemesis Pixy Misa gets involved with Bill Gates , I mean Biff Standard (same thing) so poor Bill (umm Biff) has a fighting chance.<p>In all the commotion, there are some tender moments revealing what's going on inside of Sasami's head.  That's what makes this series special.  She's the perfect daughter we would all like to have.<p>The Sammy series is extra complicated because 4 different instances of it exist. Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the &quot;Mihoshi Special&quot; and later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. (It was Sasami's dream to be Pretty Sammy). Next came the OVA, which is what this tape is from. Later a TV series followed.<p>Recommmended for Shoujo (Japanese Girl Anime) and Tenchi fans. This one is extra funny for those who work in the computer industry.  This is also good for little kids, and those who are kids at heart.
Finally - the long awaited completion to the Ryo Ohki OVA collection is available! GREAT! Now I get to watch it from beginning to end as it was intended.<br /><br />...or so I thought...<br /><br />First off, the different voices for Lady Tokimi, Tenchi, Ryoko, Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi really throws off the enjoyment of the story after watching it back to back with the original 13 OVA episodes. If I had spaced it out, it might not be as jarring. But, there it is. And to be honest, only Ryoko's and Tokimi's voice actress' had changed. The others are just out of practice I guess... And after a while, they seem to find their spot again.<br /><br />I just can't get over Mihoshi now sounding like Sugar (from Snow Fairy Sugar) instead of Mihoshi. She falls back into Mihoshi better as the series progresses, but tends to go back and forth. The voices of the guardians, Washu, Sasami, and Ayeka, were of course, spot on.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes is mostly recaps from the first 13 episodes. Almost no new material here worth speaking of, other than the introduction of a couple of new characters.<br /><br />Also starting about 30 minutes in the DD 5.1 audio track contains dirty audio causing the LFE to oscillate. This is mostly noticeable in the quieter dialogue scenes. Speaking of audio - at least on the 5.1 track, I can't say on the others, some of the voices echo for no reason as if the recording studio wasn't properly deadened, or the mix wasn't done properly. This happens more on the surround channels than the front field channels.<br /><br />Disk 2 doesn't seem to have these audio problems. In fact, regarding disk 2, the only complaints I have are that the story line reminded me a lot of Evangellion Death and Rebirth. Without giving away any spoilers, I wont say more. :)<br /><br />Disk 3...  Well, it is just one episode. Tenchi finally finds out about his mother... Or does he? I'll let you decide. This disk is also free from the "dirty audio" that plagued the 5.1 track of the first disk.<br /><br />All-in-all, it did clean up most of the hanging story line, even if there were inconsistancy issues along the way. But, I guess after so much time, that's bound to happen.<br /><br />If you are just a casual watcher of the series, then you might want to find a way to rent it. If you are an avid fan, then this is a must for your collection.
The price and service were exemplary. However the series has no fluidity or any real direction. There are some naughty parts in the first disc of the series. But then they didn't know which way to take it. They just kept making them anyway
Let me start off by saying that I am in love with the first and second Tenchi Muyo! OVA series. Although sometimes the story was confusing due to writing or translations, it is one of the coolest and funniest animes that I've seen. The character development and inventiveness of the series was great. The latest seven episodes included in The Viridian Collection are unfortunately a big exception.<br /><br />I was very excited as the episodes were being released sequentially, and I bought the individual volumes as they became available. However, after each episode I was left with a big sense of disappointment. Here is a list of my biggest complaints:<br /><br />-Ryoko is now voiced by Mona Marshall who seems to have no respect for the incredible coolness that Petrea Burchard brought to the character. Once my favorite character of the series, I now dread any time she appears on screen. Marshall has done good work in the past, but her shrill and downright obnoxious performance as Ryoko will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  The actress playing Mihoshi (and the writers who produced her dialogue) is also missing what made the character so funny in the originals. In these episodes she's reduced to a completely unfunny moron.<br /><br />-The series is totally and completely weighted down by new characters who serve absolutely no purpose to the overall story. Not only do they bring in new characters, but they fail to develop them at all. The writers seem to think that a one sentence explanation of where they came from will be enough to satisfy viewers. Sadly, the new characters (of which there are probably around 10) distract from the ones that fans of the series have grown love.<br /><br />-The real meat of the story arc that people are familiar with from the second OVA is really only addressed in one episode, and, since there is enough content in that one episode to have filled the entire seven episodes of the series, the episode as a whole comes off as contrived and convoluted. Not only that, but you'll start the episode (Z) and be completely lost as it plays out thinking that surely you must have skipped an episode before. Had the writers not spent the first five episodes introducing new characters and telling completely superfluous stories, this episode could have been the climactic conclusion that would have satisfied fans of the series. Sadly it is only a suggestion of what it could have been.<br /><br />I'm sure this comes across as overly negative, but the only positive aspects I can think of would be fairly good animation and the voice acting of the veteran cast members. Unfortunately even these have flaws with odd looking 3D computer generated animations at times and the age of the voice actors coming through in their performances.<br /><br />I'm hesitant to recommend this even to diehard fans of the franchise. While the craving to get some sort of closure for the series is understandable, I'm afraid this will only leave fans feeling bitter. If you feel the need to see these latest episodes, do your best to find somewhere to rent them such as Netflix. It's most likely not something you'll want to watch a second time.
As a huge Tenchi fan that grew up watching it when Cartoon Network actually showed cartoons and Toonami I really really enjoy Tenchi Muyo! It's ashamed to see that it is not as popular as it was before but things change but let me get back on the actual DVD,<br /><br />It's has 4 Episodes from the 1st Tenchi Series which is the OVA and not any of the other ones that you may have seen or encountered (like Universe or Tokyo) it's starts off with Tenchi trying to get into this cave but his grandpa (who is actually the runaway prince of Jurai, Yosho) forbids him. In a comedic twist he ends up getting the keys to the cave and from there he meets a mummified Ryoko who his grandpa Yosho defeated long ago. Now Tenchi being scared leaves the cave but takes with him the sword named "Tenchi" as well. Later on he meets Ryoko rejunvinated and looking sexier than before wants revenge on Tenchi since she as she puts it "wants revenge and doesn't care whether he is Yosho or not." Tenchi in another comedic twist cuts off Ryoko's hand and "defeats her". Even though she lost, she has the ability of rengeneration so her hand is okay. In the end Tenchi returns home to find a nice surprise in store for him in his bed. ;)<br /><br />The next episode basically introduces Ayeka, Sasami and Nobuyuki (Tenchi's Dad) but I won't go and summarize it since people probably want to see it for themselves. Anyway, this DVD only has four episodes but is much much cheaper than the actual OVA boxset, which is about 100 dollars here on Amazon, so if you want to own the OVAs I'd recommend buying these DVDs instead but overall, if you're a fan of the Toonami anime classics like Dragon Ball, One Piece and Outlaw Star then you'll love Tenchi Muyo!<br /><br />5 Stars out of 5! (I'd give it 10 though. :D)
I was so hoping that this was the Tenchi that I had watched a while ago but alas it is not. Also none of the voice actors were the same as in the older Tenchi shows. I did like it but it was also very confusing to what I was used to in a Tenchi show. So I don't disapprove of it I just would rather watch Tenchi in Tokyo or Tenchi Universe.
This particular volume in the Tenchi Muyo OAVs brings us the conflict with Kagato, the introduction of another girl into Tenchi's extended family and a comedy episode with some foreshadowing for things to come. It still features the usual mix of comedy and plot twists galore that the Tenchi Muyo OAVs are well known for. The disc comes with Japanese and English audio which will satisfy fans of both preferences. But special features in this disc are lacking as the only notable feature is a collection of trailers for titles that Pioneer/Geneon recently distributed and licensed back in 2002/ 2003 when this DVD first came out. If you just want the episodes, then this volume of the Tenchi Muyo OAVs is worth purchasing. If you want special features, then try hunting down the Tenchi Muyo Ultimate Edition DVD set which has an extensive offering of special features for fans to go giddy over.
I think this was a great video. It was funny and nicely done. I wont spoil it for you but get it if you have seen both tenchi and sailor moon.
This is the first REAL dramatic episode in the Tenchi Muyo series, but  it's one of the best!  While in a hot springs Ryoko is telling Ayeka about  how she watched Tenchi grow up when a super villian named Kagato shows up  out of nowhere and takes controll of Ryoko's mind!  Tenchi challenges him  to a battle but quickly looses.  Yosho shows up just in time to stop Ryoko  from hurting anyone but can't do a thing to stop Kagato from taking her  with him.  Yosho reveils that he is Ayeka's big brother from the plant  they're from, and said that Tenchi is destinded to be her wife!  But first  they must get Ryoko back from Kagato!  With the right amount of action,  drama, and of course, humor makes this a Tenchi episode worth getting!
A spinoff of Tenchi Muyo and a spoof of Sailor Moon and other &quot;Magical Girl&quot; animes, Pretty Sammy is the story about a &quot;Magical Girl&quot; who is embarrassed to be Pretty Sammy and has the  cutest sidekick ever: the &quot;miaw!&quot;-ing cabbit who once in the  while gains the power to speak. Anyway, if you like Tenchi Muyo, check this  one out too!<p>LOVE THE THEME SONG!!
The Mihoshi special was really good but it was way too similar to Journy Through Time and Space(Tenchi Universe.) Ayeka was again supposed to marry Tenchi and that's the last thing most of us would want to see. I wasn't too happy about seeing Washu as a bad guy. The episode was not bad...don't get me wrong, I just expected a new plot.I reccomend this video for TENCHI fans and non-TENCHI fans. It is good.I love Ryoko in this episode especially because she's adorable! Enjoy the video^_-!
I remember my pre teen years watching this show. Loved it. This is VERY MISLEADING INDEED! I should have read ALL of the customer reviews before buying. It's not a complete series. It's the last seven episodes. I wasted good money to get Screwed over. Lesson Learned. Luckily I purchased used so it wasn't a complete loss. Even if you wanna go search for the OVA 1 and 2 of Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki, don't. Tenchi Universe is much better and funnier. Go that route instead.
