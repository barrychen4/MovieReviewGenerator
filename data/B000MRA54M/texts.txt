The acting was bad, the story could have worked if the movie wasn't filled with stupid fillers like one of the characters waiting around for a pay check, another character sitting around in a closet and making a big deal about a narcoleptic janitor.  Much of the movie was filled with stretched out dead moments.  Really, never recorded Tupac lyrics on a roll of toilet paper sitting on a shelf in an office, come on.
Not worth the money.  No plot.  Just some nonsense. Don't waste your time or money.
rent it. If u must see it. I should have kept on walking. Loved the actors but this movie just gave them a little paycheck. I couldn't finish this movie at all. I tried then I said why?
