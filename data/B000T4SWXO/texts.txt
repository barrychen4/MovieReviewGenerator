What an amazing 2 disk concert!  All acoustic, Dave on piano once, what more could you want?  Oh and an interview with Dave and Tim about their beginings in a bar, sure you got it!  If you are a Dave or Tim fan, a must have!!
Dave and Tim are amazing in this two-disc CD. This is the best live Dave I have ever heard. Almost every song on here is great. Love the neil young cover. stay or leave, out of my hands, down by the river, you are my sanity, and sister are my favorites, they are all beautiful.
I was expecting a so so product Since Luther college was so good how can it really get much better.  But this CD is really good.  I mean really good. Its different than the other acoustic stuff they have done together but it has some excellent material in it.  I would have payed 40 dollars for a CD of this quality.  I have just about all the Dave Mathews CD's and this one ranks right up in the top 5 or 7 of them.
I am a huge Dave Matthews Band fan and this CD is one of my personal favorites.  It is a live, acoustic, double disk or Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds.  The two put on a magnificent performance of DMB classics, new releases, and tasteful covers.  This is a must have for any DMB fan or any lover of acoustic music.  A work of art!
If you like DMB or Dave Matthews at all... you will certainly LOVE this DVD! I cannot imagine it being much better. Dave and Tim are ON! The sound quality and the shots are fantastic! Intimate and grand at the same time. You'll probably want the CD once you see this, so do yourself a favor and buy both if a discount is offered.
to all you morons giving this less than 4 or 5 stars because you think it is sub par to live at luther college, you are wrong.  i will admit those of you who made the comment about dave talking and crowd noise being more, you  are correct. there is far more talking and crowd noise.<br /><br />but, how can you say this is sub par?  this cd has alot of songs that you probably never heard before. alot of these songs are not on any of his live discs. tim reynolds shines like a crazy diamond on this cd.  he is an amazing guitarest. the only reason why you people are giving this less credit than deserved is that you know what you were going to get!! when luther college came out back in the day, no one knew of tim reynolds and no one knew how good dave's music would sound with out the actual band.  i think this stuff sounds soo good even without the actual band.<br /><br />i perfer this over luther because there are more unheard songs on this disc. plus an amazing version of grave digger.
This DVD is wonderful. It has great cinematography and sound. Even my husband enjoyed it and he is not usually a DMB fan.
fantastic set!  wish i was there when they had this session.  i am so addicted to the Cornbread song.  It's hard to pick a favorite song that they performed but dave and tim do such a great job together.  can't wait for a new studio album.  keep up the good work dave and tim.
As a great admirer of Dave Matthew's song writing and performing abilities it was a real treat to listen to this excellent double cd of an acoustic show that he and fellow guitarist Tim Reynold's performed at Radio City back in 2006. There are some fantastic versions of songs like stay or leave, crush, lie in our graves, two step and also there is a beautiful rendition of the Neil Young classic 'down by the river'. Also included are a few rare tracks such as sister, still water and eh hee. The quality of the recordings is excellent, though my only criticism with the production is that there is some talking and chatter that if edited out would have made the cd flow more smoothly. Apart from that it is a fantastic collection of DMB and Dave's solo songs.
It is a testament to Dave Matthews' songwriting skills when he can strip them down to their basics, and not lose the feel for these remarkable songs, Lie in Our Graves being perhaps the finest example in this intimate set.  Of course, it doesn't hurt having Tim Reynolds adding color to the songs with his remarkable range of strings.  I really enjoyed this 2-disc set, as the Dave and Tim seemed wonderfully relaxed, exchanging licks and drawing some beautiful rhythms out of the songs, including some folk ballads and covers of Neil Young and Daniel Lanois.  Dave even takes a turn on the piano at one point.  There is a political undercurrent running through the songs, with Dave and Tim occasionally making comments on the Iraq war and other issues that burn at their souls. But, it is the more poignant aspects of these songs that really stand out, as Dave seems to go back to his childhood in painting vivid portraits in the haunting song, Gravedigger.<br /><br />There does seem to be an oddly fatalistic quality to many of the songs, coming from a man at the peak of his career with what appears to be many good years to come.  Matthews is one of the great songwriters of his generation and whether with his band or in intimate settings like this one, his songs resonate to those who have grown up listening to his music.  He has amassed a strong following, as witnessed by the many live albums now available, showing that he gives as much as he receives, in allowing his listeners to experience his shows like this remarkable performance at Radio City Music Hall.
Love it, love it, love it! I am a huge Dave Matthew's fan, whether he's with the band, solo, or Tim Reynolds, which is the case here. Great song choices, great sound. Dave's voice is always unfailing, even live. Beautiful guitar by Tim Reynolds too. Some of the greats on this cd. "Stay or Leave", my all time favorite, "Crush", and of course the old goodies "Crash" and "Two Step". Highly recommended!
So glad I bought it.  Almost as awesome as Dave & Tim live at luther college, but it's up there.
deserves a 5 for many reasons, but especially for his powerful rendition of The Maker. His version is beautiful. Several of the songs on this work have appeared in various incarnations on other discs. What makes Dave so amazing is how he manages to breathe new life into songs that have now become classic. Each listen becomes an extraordinary experience, as if he takes you through familiar territory while bringing you into higher and higher states of bliss.
This is a great balance of songs ranging from full band to Dave's solo bits to Tim's amazing concoctions.  I thought the performances were flawless from both guys and the quality of the show well exceeds Luther College (which is great in its own right).  Could listen to The Maker until the cows come home...
This is by far Dave's best live album to date... even better than "Live at Luther College". Tim Reynolds is amazing once again.
Both the music and DVD quality are good, well above average.  At first, I didn't find Dave's talking in between songs much of a problem.  By the end of the DVD, I realized that it had become a distraction for me and detracted from my overall enjoyment of the concert.
Although not as good as the Luther College cd, this cd is another great live album by one of the most talented artist of this generation, Dave Matthews. I don't think that Tim shines on this record as he does on Luther College.<br />In the end, this is yet another 5 star release by Dave.
I have a 100 inch screen, a Panasonic AE 4000 U projector, three Adcom amps, Klipsch KLF-30's, Klipsch center, Klipsch rears, Blu-Ray player, Pioneer Elite receiver, Dayton Titanic sub. I built this system for Blu-Ray concerts. No little plastic crappy speakers in my Concert Room. I own tons of concerts. This is BY FAR the best concert I own. I am a Dave and Tim fan, not as much as others, but I religiously watch this concert weekly. The 1080 resolution, Tru-HD, 24P, Radio City Music Hall, man, it just don't get any better. The sound is amazing. When people come over to check out the system, this is absolutely the disc that goes in. For $22, you will get your moneys worth, guarantee. My #1 on the disc? Old Dirt Hill. 2 acoustic guitars, how is my question, incredible.
I wish he wouldn't try to mix politics with his music (like the rant about the Iraq war) but other than that, top-notch stuff and one of my favorites of all time.  "Crush" is worth the price of admission alone!
I am a huge DMB fan and this concert has the best versions of my favorite songs as well as great new songs!!
Excellent DVD that sounds great in surround sound. A lot of personality is portrayed, and their chemistry is easily seen on stage. Highly recommended for the acoustic lover.
Great production and even if you don't know this artist and you love acoustic music concerts, this is a great one.

I bought this for my wife, who has been to MULTIPLE Dave concerts. We put this Blu-Ray Disc into our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y634SU">Panasonic DMP-BD30K 1080p Blu-Ray Disc Player</a> and could not believe the picture clarity coming through our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UN3VT4">Sharp Aquos LC42D64U 42" 1080p LCD HDTV</a>. The sound coming through our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OG6I24">Sony HT-SS2000 Blu-ray Disc Matching Component Home Theater System</a> was absolutely phenomenal! We will be buying more Music Blu-Ray DVDs of our other favorite artists for sure.
In the new age of blu-ray, this is with out the best ref-guide material out to date.
This DVD is sensational! What talent, great music,  excellent video quality!<br /><br />A must have if you love the acoustic side of Dave!
Dave matthew and Tim Reynolds Live At Radio Music Hall. This is a cd not to miss if you are Matthews and Reynolds fan. In fact its not a cd to miss if you enjoy accustic guitar. If you were lucky enough as i was to go and see them this year on tour, it brings back memories of a great show.  If you didnt sit back and enjoy.  Soak it up. Close your eyes and you will be there. Great cd, beautiful music, and a few new suprises on the way.
This DVD is in many ways better than Live at Luther College.  For one thing, Dave and Tim have gotten much better since then and there are many more great songs that they perform.  Also, Dave does a lot more story telling during the performance filling the audience in on some incites he had when he wrote some of the songs.  Finally, as a lover of the Luther College CD, it was great to actually be able to see what Dave and Tim look like on stage together.  A must own for any DMB fan!
What a passionate, revealing concert. Dave Matthews, in his own clever way, talks about a soldier who served in Iraq, and got screwed by the system; talks about the connection he has with his sister, which was beautiful; and  Tim Reynolds blows us away with his musicianship. What a moving, wonderful experience to share with us. Thanks Dave and Tim.
If you liked Dave and Tim Live at Luther College, you'll enjoy this one as well.  It is the same dual-acoustic live performance without percussion, sax, bass and fiddle, but with an updated song list.  Dave plays the "straight man" to keep the beat while Tim goes crazy up and down the frets.<br /><br />Conservatives beware: Dave spews out a lot of anit-war retoric in between the songs.  It isn't blatent and hearing it once or twice isn't terrible, but after I'd owned the CD for awhile, I got really sick of it and found myself searching for the fast forward button on my CD player.
After hearing tons of recordings and live performances by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, I have to say I wasn't that impressed with this album. They seemed very unenthusiastic.  I was so excited to listen to it only to be very disappointed and I have only listened to it a few times, guess I'll sell it used on here!  If you want a great CD check out Into the Wild Soundtrack by Eddie Vedder!
Overall an excellent live performance.  Dave puts togehter an incredible set mostly comprised of his deeper/moodier songs.  The integration on these two disks is great, the songs flow from one to the next seemlessly.<br /><br />It almost as if this performance reflects your own mood.  If your happy, it will come of as uplipting.  If your in a bad place, these songs will allow you to wallow in it, as they seem darker.<br /><br />Tim Reynolds is always incredible, these guys make great music together.<br /><br />My only beef is that Dave gets a little preachy... talking about Iraq and other issues.  Sometimes you just want him to shut up and play.
This isn't bad for what it is, but what drew me to Dave Matthews Band back in the mid-90's was just that... the band. Part of the appeal, to me, of Dave Matthews Band's music is their musicianship, both in-studio and on-stage. Every member brings something complementary to the overall sound, like pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly. So if you're a big fan of acoustic guitar work or you like DMB just because of Dave, go for it. But if you're a fan of the entire band and their overall sound, this may not be the best choice for you.
First let me begin this review by saying I am just a casual fan of Dave Matthews. I have seen him live once and see why his band is such a big draw. I can only say for those on the fence about whether to pick this one; you will not be disappointed. The sound is friggin incredible (friggin meaning clean, undistorted, and jamming). It is mellow at points and full of so much good energy, soul, and chemistry at others. This is just me: I like to listen to this one from beginning to end. He and Tim Reynolds are flawless together at times and this concert puts me a good mood each time I listen to it.<br /><br />For those who are just want to know about the MP3 downloads and not the whole CD. I would say all but the absolute minimum: Bartender, Save Me, Gravedigger, Still Water, Don't Drink the Water, Cornbread, Down by the River, You are my Sanity, Lie in our Graves, Some Devil & Two Step. But you really are missing out on a masterpiece of a concert. I know about his other great live cds but this one is special.<br /><br />If you do not like Dave Matthews, please listen to this one and forget whatever preconceptions you have and just appreciate this one for what it is-awesome.
My daughter loves the DVD, it came when it was suppose to and in good shape, I can't think of another thing to write
I'm really impressed.<br /><br />Very very good blu-ray to listen to. Only 2 guitars ??? WTF sound so special.<br /><br />Sound is rich, natural and audio quality is impressive, one of the best dvd blu-ray to own for sure if you like Dave Matthews.<br /><br />Dave also make it fun to listen to.<br /><br />A must to listen to !
I am a huge fan of Dave Matthews and this DVD definitely did not disappoiont me.  Teamed with Tim Reynold made the concert way above all it could be.  Loved it!
If you love Dave Matthews and own a Blue-Ray player, you should not pass this one up.
If you are a DM fan, you will love this DVD with Tim Reynolds. My only beef is I wish I had been there live. Fantastic. Wonderful, terrific. What more can you say?
If I had to choose a concert that I could see over and over; this it it. I loved it.
If you like Dave Matthews, this CD is a must have. The acoustic performance by Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds is nothing short of astounding.
This is one of my favorite live CDs from Dave Matthews. But of course they are all great! :]
Simply the best...  "Down by the River" is one of our favorites, but, it is all great...
I was never much of a Dave Matthews fan before I bought this album.<br />Every single track on this cd is breathtaking!<br />This will go down as one of my all time favorites.
I had no doubt that this would be a great performance. I was completely blown away with Blu-ray quality. The sound and video are excellent. The countless amount a viewing still amazes and astounds. Tim Reynolds is an awesome guitarist as well.
Excellent HD concert, the sound and video are near top tier for Blu. If you like Dm this is a must have for you collection
I was astounded by this performance and the sound received through my BluRay DVD player and surround sound system.  Dave Matthews gives it his all and Tim Reynolds is magical on the guitar. Do realize that it is all acoustical with no backup band.  None is needed.  Worth every penny.
Absolutely the highest quality music recording I have ever heard.  I am not even a real Dave Matthews fan, but I was completely spellbound the entire concert.  This is a must for your Blu-Ray collection, if for nothing else, to impress your friends.
I am a huge DMB fan and this is the best CD I have ever owned.....period.  Dave's cover of Neil Young's "Down By The River" is worth the money you pay for this CD all by itself.  "Cornbread" is another incredible track.  I can't overstate how important it is that DMB fans out there add this one to their collection.
The music is great, Tim and Dave are awesome together!  Could do without Dave's political rants, but that's just Dave for you.
Best Dave live Concert CD set you can buy!  Dave on piano once, great fingerpicking by Tim- just Awesome!
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQL4ZQ">Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds: Live at Radio City Music Hall</a><br /><br />Prompt delivery/great price for this must-have live performance from the best musicians of today!!
The performances by Dave and Tim are spectacular.  We can't get over how good this DVD is.  Enjoy Enjoy Enjoy!!!
This is an unabriged version of the show Dave and Tim put on at Radio City Music hall.  I'll assume that the only thing that may have been edited out was Dave's coustomarily long pauses between songs.  That being said both disks come in at two and a half hours.  This album contains some great "Dave Speak" or odd rambling that he tends to engage in at shows.<br /><br />It is amazing how much sound two guitars and Dave's vocals can make.  After listening to "Luther College" for the firt time in awhile both Dave and Tim have grown as musicians.  Tim's guitar work wanders into the surreal and Dave's improvision on vocals keeps you guessing on each track.  The overall fullness of the sound is impressive.<br /><br />I would highly recomend this to any fan who enjoys live albums.
I've seen Dave and Tim twice. Once at Radio City in 2003 and at West Point the same year. Maybe having seen those shows makes me biased, but in my opinion Dave's singing sounds a little flat on this recording during some of the classics like #41, Bartender, Grace is Gone and Lie on Our Graves. Compared to Luther College Dave almost sounds like he's a bit bored or just going through the motions at times and as others have said, Tim doesn't shine on this recording. Fortunately, the new tracks are very good and there's plenty still to enjoy.<br /><br />For the DMB fans out there who have a collection of shows which might include some D&T recordings from the past, this set might be a little disappointing. It doesn't compare to the Boone performance from 2003 widely available thru legal trading for example where Dave sings with amazing energy and Tim shines as the guitar virtuoso that he is. This one is still worth picking up, but it's not the best example of a D&T show out there.
A great show with a lot of good musics. The partnership between Dave and Tim is something beautiful to see!! Especially in the "Lie in Our Graves"! One of the most incredible music I have seen/ heard!!
This is great. I mean a must have for any DM fan especially with Tim Reynolds' accompanyment. However, Dave treats this performance as a Storytellers X 10 type of show. Beautifully treated tunes are interrupted by minutes (sometimes over 10)of speech- while Tim probably showers & naps before being cued for the next one. The bathroom lines must have been great with all the down time but it's one of those DVD's you wished had the 'songs only' menu.
I have been a Dave Matthews fan for about eight years and have to say this is one of the best performances I've ever heard. From "Bartender" to "Two Step" the intesity never lets up. The way these two guys seem to connect when they're on stage is truly amazing. I would recommended this DVD to anybody.
Purchased this Blu-ray to test out my new hardware and it certainly shines, great sound and good looking video make this a true reference disc. The performance however, is not on par with the Luther college gig, and make no mistake, this is not the DMB so some may be dissapointed with the content. My biggest gripe though, is with Dave's inane babel between songs. This guy really needs to stick to the music and put a cork in it, kinda ruined the experience for me. Hey, maybe let Tim do the talking!
I'm a big Dave Matthews fan - I've seen DMB 40+ times in concert and was excited to pick up the Live at Radio City Music Hall cd's.  After a couple of listens, I gotta admit that it's definitely pretty average in my opinion.  I keep waiting for a track to take off but even on my favorites (like #41) they just seem to languish.
As always, Dave rocks.<br /><br />Did not received 5 stars because it does not have the lyrics.
To me the Cortez the Killer version of Neil Young's song in Central Park needs to be on BluRay and many disks will be sold!
This double cd has quickly become one of my favorites.  I was never a DMB fan until I heard this album.  I particularly enjoy the the "unplugged" style. I could do without some of the political commentary, but otherwise an excellent performance.
This concert was amazing. The two of them are a perfect compliment to each other. Wow!! Could they play!
Sounds OK, but nothing really new.<br /><br />It's great for the hard core fans...
If you enjoyed Dave and Tim in the Live at Luther College venue, you are in for a treat!!  This is my favorite way to enjoy Dave Matthews - with Tim Reynolds.  They are masters - both of them.
Great DVD got it last night. Definitely In the top 3 best with central park.
This is a great quality DVD and the music is great, but Dave acts like he's twacked out in some parts and talks way too much. If you're looking for a DVD to pop in and rock out to, this is not it. If you're looking for something to relax to, this is a good choice.
Great video & sound quality. Awesome set list, (some from "Some Devil" album). Dave & Tim, need I say more. Buy it if you're a fan of the Lutheran College CD.
I am primarily a classic rock fan. Im 26.  Been around Dave fans for awhile now.  I own a burned copy of Busted Stuff and I own this record. Thats it.  Ive seen dave 4 times.  And this is the only DMB record I have ever purchased.  I always cringed at the Red Rocks era stuff.  it seemed so meaningless, immature, and self-indulgent.  and the fans were so pushy about it.  I Absolutely HATED SATELLITE and SPACE BETWEEN and ANTS GO MARCHING and TRIPPING BILLIES and Many Others...  BUT THIS RECORD IS DIFFERENT THAN OLD DAVE MATTHEWS... This music right here really puts Dave Matthews into the realm of artist with a message.  Thankfully, he shows some real subtlety and some real grit on this album.  I would recommend it to any fan of rock music and believers in the message of rock music.  The "Dave Speak" as old fans call it is what Rock And Roll is all about.  It bothers me some of his fans think he should "shut his mouth" about the atrocities being committed in the name of USA.  I like how he is reaching out to people like me who dont like to just bounce around like a hippy (or yuppy) but want to be a part of his music.  Cornbread is the perfect song to do it.  If your like me and would rather be listening to John Lennon or Bob Dylan, check out this record, and you'll be surprised.  Honestly, Tim Reynolds brings out the soul in Dave's sometimes "fluffy" rock tunes.  I hope his old fans who prefer the "safe" Dave Matthews come to their senses and trade in their suburbans for hybrids.<br /><br />"If you know what I mean, then god bless you." - Sonic Youth
This is my first experience with a Dave and Tim show.  I must say, it is nothing short of spectacular.  There is a chemistry between them that is incredible.  I think this is the best I've ever seen and heard Dave. I'm just sad that I wasn't there that night.
Have many blu-rays.  Lots of concerts.  A lot of hype has been written about this blu-ray concert, so I bought it without hesitation.<br /><br />Now about 2 years later, I have watched it ONCE.  Boring.  Boring.<br /><br />Try renting it.  Not for everyone.
Nice Blue ray, but wish it was on one disc and got rid of some of the so so songs. I also agree with the one reviewer that said he only watched this once in a year. I may watch it again but not anytime soon.
Dave Matthews is great during a live performance.  You cannot go wrong.  Tim Reynolds however sounds like a little kid hitting the high keys on a piano, while you are trying to play a serious piece.  Maybe it worked during the performance, but it does not work on the CD.  This probably explains why this CD is cheaper than other live Dave Matthews Band CD's.  However, for the price, it is a good buy, just skip the pieces you don't like.
This DVD is amazing. Dave is such a great artist and Tim backs him up very well.
What's with all his Live recordings with Tim sound the same?  They do that annoying guitar vibrato?<br />Good songs, good singing.  Enjoyable cd, just feels like more of the same with Dave.<br />Tim plays well but people that think he is a guitar G-D need to seriously take a step back and listen to some of the 80's and 70's guitar legends.  Those guys had as much if not more talent than Tim.  Tim is a GREAT guitarist, but not the end all be all of rock artists.
When I listen to music I want to be left feeing high. This dvd was a tad depressing ...Musically, it is great, Reynolds is a wizard on the guitar and the chemistry is awesome.  I just don't wanna hear Dave babbling on about mistreated soldiers, blah, blah, blah...the dvd comes with the story in print, which *should* be read and brought to people's attention, just not during what should be an uplifting musical experience.  Who wants to hear bummer stories @ a concert!?  Not me personally.  It left me feeling like i had just watched a benefit show for wounded vets...In other words, don't watch the dvd expecting good vibes...It's a bum trip....I sure hope they edited all of Dave's banter out of the cd, especially the wounded soldier rap....Just shut up and Play Music.  (please)
I collect many Blue-Ray concerts...<br />This was the worst and gave it away. I was expecting something better considering the reviews on here.. Guess there are a lot more hard core Dave Mathew groupies than I thought.. I have overlooked bad Video/Audio because the artist did a good job.<br /><br />I would have been upset if I paid to see this..
Live at Luther College is amazing. Tim Reynolds expanded my awareness of what an acoustic guitar can do in the hands of a genius with exceeding technical skill; his composition "Stream" is mindblowing, as are his solos/riffs on songs like Ants Marching and Tripping Billies. So:<br /><br />What happened??<br /><br />I had the highest hopes for this album. Even after a disappointing first disc, I thought surely the "classic" songs at the end of disc 2 would be winners. But, sadly, no.<br /><br />The only song I think I will listen to in the future from this show is "The Maker". I have heard the DMB cover from the early 90s, the revamped version (e.g., Live in Chicago), although never the original; Dave puts some extra soul into this one, that comes through with only a couple acoustic guitars as backing.
I had to splice out about 30 minutes of crowd noise [applause?] and crude comments by Dave to have a listenable disc.  Dave is talented, unfortuately his ego preceeds all his performances like oobleck seeping everywhere.....
With lossless 5.1 24-bit/96kHz Dolby TrueHD, uncompressed 2.0 24-bit/48kHz PCM and a high bit-rate pristine VC-1 1080p picture, this marks not only the first time a Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds show is being released on a video format, but the first time we have a lossless high resolution surround mix of these two great musicians.<br />You can read the tracklist to see what is on this disc. D+T shows are always pretty special if you're lucky enough to get one.<br />Is the difference worth spending $3 more than the DVD? Only if you have a Blu-ray player or a Playstation 3, then you would be foolish to NOT buy it. Even if you don't have an HDTV the high bitrate VC-1 encode will look far superior at 480i on a standard television set than the DVD will.<br />If you do pick this up, get ready to experience Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds like never before.<br />As Peter Bracke said on High Def Digest about this release "the TrueHD is without a doubt the best audio presentation I've yet heard on a next-gen release. I mean it -- it's that good."<br />Do you hear that people? The best audio presentation of any Blu-ray or HD DVD disc to date.<br />Enjoy. =D
OK OK While I'd like to say I'm a huge Dave fan, I will admit that unlike some of the people that will buy this CD, I only have been to 6 concerts and own 10-12 CDs including 5 live discs.<br /><br />To most people that is a lot, but to Dave Matthew addicts that might not.  I know that there are some people so obsessed that they probably have all 54 or so albums (90% of them live) that have been released.<br /><br />That being said I have to say that this album in my opinion is well deserving of a 5 star rating for the following reasons:<br /><br />a) Sound Quality - 5 stars.  The sound quality is perfect.  Just enough crowd and the band is captured well.  Not to much voice not too much band.  Perfect.<br /><br />b) Song Selection - 5 Stars.  A Few old songs a few classics, some Lillywhite stuff, but plenty of newer stuff.  I also own the Live Trax Fenway album that has 4 cds.  I mean I love Dave, but 4 discs is too many.  Dave plays so many songs I realize it's tough to pare down a weekend of concerts into one CD, and that is why this disc gets 5 stars.  Perfect paring.  And yes there are some new tracks on here as well!<br /><br />c) Performance - 4.5 stars - Comparing this disc to the Luther College Tim Reynolds disc is tough since that was the standard, but despite Tim not shining as bright as he did on that album he still adds plenty to this disc as would be expected.  Also I notice that it seems like everyone kind of brings their A game.  Not sure if it's Tims presence or what but it is definitely noticeable.  And yes there's a little Dave speak, but overall very good.  And did I hear a piano in there...<br /><br />d) Value - 5 stars - Amazon has this for $11.99 that is great for a new release live disc from DMB that contains a couple new songs, but more importantly new live versions of recent songs.  I mean if people are comparing this to Live at Luther College from 7-8 years ago then you know it's worth the $.<br /><br />Overall this CD is great.  My favorite still remains the Red Rocks two disc.  For the simple fact that at the time it was awesome.  It is still good, despite the fact that having heard all those songs played over and over in so many live versions has made it lose its luster.  However as a new release live disc, I don't think there's a two disc release from that Dave to date that was greeted with so much widespread enjoyment as that albums was way back in 1997.
I recently had a Pioneer 6010FD, Denon 4306 AVR, and Samsung BDP-1200 installed.  I put this disc in to demo the new home theater setup for my wife.  To say she was blown away is an understatement.<br /><br />My AVR doesn't decode TrueHD.  However, the PCM 2.0 was incredible.  The clarity of the music was unbelievable.  The music just seemed to fill the room and take your breath away. Sound seemed to be coming from everywhere.<br /><br />The video wasn't shabby, either.  In 1080p you could even read notes that Dave had written on his hand.<br /><br />If you want to showcase your new system, this disc is tops for showing the capabilities of the audio and does a fantastic job with the video as well.
This concert is outstanding.  The quality is amazing.  This DVD has the BEST sound quality of any previous release.  The camera work is great.  I have been a huge fan of the Dave Matthews Band since I heard "What Would You Say" on the radio back in the early 90s.  I thought Live at Luther College was wonderful, but Live at Radio City Music Hall shines in many many ways.<br /><br />The sound is really like being there.  Even the video quality is extremely clear.  The track listing is nearly perfect for a newer release.  Not too much old stuff, not too much of the crappy stuff, and some excellent new material.  I have to say how wonderful it is to witness Tim Reynolds play the guitar.  I've only imagined it since their last release in the late 90s.  To not only hear him, but see him play will leave you with your mouth open.<br /><br />To hear Dave tell the stories he has to tell is a real treat.  I always enjoy his ramblings, because sometimes, even if they seem like they aren't going anywhere, they always end up of some importance to the next song.  The story about "The Bushmen" is entertaining and interesting as he goes into Eh Hee.  Also the performance of Crush could be the most moving version I've ever heard.<br /><br />Overall, I this should be on the top of any fan's list of what to buy.  If you're choosey about buying the many live discs the group puts out, buy this one without second thought.
I hadn't given Luther College a listen in a long time before picking up this brand new Dave/Tim release. When I placed the CD in the player, the first track, a haunting version of "Bartender", immediately conjured up memories of what it was to sit down on a dark night and pop-in Luther College for some mood music.<br /><br />That's not to say that Live at Radio City is a purely nostalgic piece. The memories of the past were soon overtaken by the glory of the present, as Radio City easily stands on its own not as Luther College's "little brother" so to speak, but as its equal.<br /><br />This can be credited to Radio City's unique song selection - only 4 of the 26 tracks presented here are on the previous Dave/Tim release. The unique tracks include Dave and Tim versions of songs from the DMB albums LWS/Busted Stuff, Before These Crowded Streets, Stand Up, and from the Dave solo album Some Devil.<br /><br />There are also a few covers of Daniel Lanois songs, as well as one Neil Young cover, and Woody Guthrie's staple "This Land Is Your Land". And, of course, Tim plays a few of his own songs, which allows him to demonstrate the full capabilities of his guitar playing. And, if that wasn't enough, there are also a few unreleased Dave-penned songs here including "Eh Hee", "Cornbread", and "Sister," all of which are being played regularly on the current (2007) DMB tour.<br /><br />Some highlights include a fantastic "Grace Is Gone" (a song that seemed to be made for this type of setting), "Lie In Our Graves", the new song "Eh Hee", "Some Devil", "When the World Ends", and I like both of the Tim songs better than "Stream". And "Old Dirt Hill" is actually kind've interesting here.<br /><br />That's all I have to say. Happy listening.
My friends and I grew up with Live at Luther. When I found out Dave and Tim were releasing a new show on video, I went crazy. Then I found out it was coming to Blu Ray, so I didn't buy the DVD and waited. My friends all bought the DVD the day it came out, and I couldn't help but cheat and watch it with them. I was amazed! My friend did not have surround sound but did have a 42" LCD, and the picture was great for a DVD. This got me so excited to see what the Blu Ray would look like in HD. WOW! I am so glad I waited!!!<br /><br />The Blu Ray has a perfect high def picture!!! On top of that, the Blu Ray features lossless DolbyTrueHD Surround Sound(96 kHz/24bit) and PCM Stereo Sound (48kHz/24bit), and I can honestly say it's the best sound quality I've heard on any concert disc. I have a nice 5.1 surround sound setup, and it's had many concerts played on it, but nothing like this!!! Compared to the DVD, I also noticed that when Tim speaks, it can actually be heard clearly on Blu Ray (and he says some pretty funny stuff). On the DVD, it just sounds like he mumbles. They might not have put his audio track on the DVD. The concert is incredible, the bonus material is incredible, and best of all, the quality of audio and video make the Blu Ray version of this show a must own for anyone with an HD setup and surround sound!
I love chocolate, but when someone hands me a Godiva truffle, I know that it's even more special.  In that same way, I love Dave Matthews Band, but watching Dave and Tim play is something different.  It's a magical thing to watch two amazing artists doing what they love.  The concert is full of Dave's fun stories, and the DVD has fun extras as well.  This is a great DVD to own.
Never has a concert captivated me like this one has.  The video is excellent, but it only takes a back seat to the awesome audio.  96kz/24-bit audio in Dolby TrueHD is the best audio I've heard in a musical recording.<br /><br />Of course, the only thing that makes all of this worth it is a good performance, and Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds do a excellent job.  The perfomances sound superb and they are entertaining to watch.  The guitars are very spatial and seperated in the surround system.  Dave Matthew's voice is clear and sounds great.  I was expecting a full band, but what we have are two great guitar players and one of our generations most versatile vocalists.<br /><br />A pleasure to own.  If you're in debate about getting this...stop!  Buy now!
I hope we can see more Dave Matthews concerts on Blu-ray.  This is without a doubt one of the best sounding movies out on blu-ray.  If you have a home theater, you can close your eyes and honestly believe you are at the concert.  It is without doubt the best sounding disc Dave Matthews has ever released from a audiophile level.  Absolutely a must own if you have a stereo and blu-ray player and call yourself a dmb fan.
If there is a better Blu Ray concert out there..... or a better live performance period.... I have never seen it.<br />This show was recorded absolutely perfectly. Top notch production all the way around, top notch performance from Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. I couldn't recommend this more.<br />If you like Dave, you will love this.
I recently purchased DMB in Central Park and really enjoyed it. The band jammed a lot and it is similar to the 2 DMB concerts I have been to. But there seemed to be something missing about that. While I really enjoyed it, I didn't love it. I did however LOVE DM and TR at RCMH.<br /><br />First off the picture quality. I watched this on a 50 inch Plasma (only capable of 1080I not 1080P) but the picture is crystal clear. Considering this is a Blu-Ray, and Sony developed Blu-Ray, and Sony owns BMG (or are at least in partnership with them) this seems to be almost a marketing piece for what Blu-Ray can do. Filmed with 9 high definition cameras, the quality is amazing. The lighting on the stages only adds to it. Turn the lights down and watch this and be prepared to be amazed.<br /><br />As for the audio quality, it too is very impressive. Not only is the recording as well as the presentation of audio on the Blu-Ray perfect, this is primarily an acoustic concert. it's just Dave and Tim playing and singing. There are no others here. The presentation is very clear and clean. The only time that is not the case is the first song in the first encore where Dave plays an electric guitar solo (and yes, there are two encores). The audio starts to get a little muddled (this is the sound from the guitar, not the way it was recorded).<br /><br />As far as the content of the DVD, the music is great. There are a lot of the standard DM songs as well as a few I haven't heard him do before. Dave also talks a fair amount before some of the songs. While some of the background on the songs is nice, DM seems to be "out there" if you know what I mean when speaking. His dialogue personally makes me like him a little less but that's just my personal opinion. But once he starts to sing, he is once again amazing.<br /><br />There are also a couple of TR solos which are classic TR and had me pressing the back button to watch again. I keep saying it but it truly is amazing.<br /><br />On Disc 2 there are a couple of items to check out. The photo montage is actually pretty cool (but I also do a lot of photography). It's only 4 or 5 minutes long so it's worth watching even if only 1 time. I started to watch the documentary (about 45 minutes). While it did shed a little light on how TR and DM met, I was again turned off by DM. I ended up stopping the documentary and watching the concert again. But that's totally fine as I didn't buy this for the documentary.<br /><br />If you have a blu-ray player and a good 5.1 system, you simply can not go wrong with this disc. If it's actually possible to wear out a Blu-Ray, this will be the first one I need to replace.
This is a very nice sounding BD. If you have a quality HT system to enjoy this, this gets even better.<br /><br />This BD houses Lossless audio at a 24bit/96hz! The sound is captured at its best and you can hear the distinctive sounds from both guitar players. The vocals are also very well mastered. It feels almost as if you are there in the live concert.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of Dave in general, so I gave it 4/5 stars. But, if I was, it's an easy 5/5! I'd more of avid Jazz fan, and Chris Botti BD excels in that regard. But then again, I really enjoyed this BD also.. So, be your own judge..
Let me start this off by saying that I would pay a ridiculous sum of money to Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds live. I've seen Dave Matthews Band play several times, but this act has eluded me. With their previous release, "Live at Luther College," being one of my favorite albums, I was very excited to see a new release come from the acoustic duo. Needless to say, I am very pleased and satisfied with this release. It is a good combination of old DMB favorites, "Some Devil" songs, and new songs that I hope will be on the new studio album (particularly "Eh Hee" and "Cornbread.") My only complaint is the plugs about the war in Iraq. Everyone is entitled to their opinions and Dave Matthews can say whatever the hell he wants in concert, however just don't put it on the live release. Not that I am not interested in the fate of U.S. soldiers injured in Iraq because they are truly our finest, but there is a time and a place for everything. When I am listening to "Live at Radio City," I want to unwind and only think about the incredible music Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds can make, not hear about all the doom and gloom that is going on in our world today. So, that's my rant, and thank you Dave for putting out this release. I hope there is more to come from you, Tim Reynolds, and DMB.
While I am a casual fan of DMB, I have always enjoyed his work with Tim Reynolds.<br />This DVD is absolutley one of the best purchases I have ever made. The performances are stunning, the musical connection between Reynolds and Mathews is unbelievable and borders on clairvoyant. The song selection and production are among the best of any concert DVD I have purchased and as I watch I am constantly saying "how does he do that" about Reynolds guitar prowess.
I think this is a fine release.  The comment that "Tim doesn't shine" on this one as he does on Luther College is absolutely true.  But more than this, Luther had an innocent, fun quality.  This release sounds more of experience.  The more recent songs work surprisingly well in their acoustic form.  The "too much talking" comment is also absolutely true.  Davespeak was once fun and funny and we couldn't get enough of it...but that was then.  Now that we are experienced...
Words hardly describe this performance. I have been a long time fan Dave Matthews' music. In order, my opinion would be this, Dave Matthews Band studio recordings are: Good. Dave Matthews Band live: Better. Dave Matthews live with Tim Reynolds: Nothing better on the planet. These two men together are unbelievable. Not only is the music amazing, The camera work and the way this was filmed (camera, editing, etc. a ) is second to none. In addition Dave tells some wonderful stories throughout the show. Buy it, buy it, buy it, NOW.....Why are you still reading? :)
I am already a Dave Matthews fan. I wanted a Blu-Ray concert Disc that would not only serve as a reference disc and show me how good concert sound could be on Blu-Ray, but I wanted a consumate Dave Matthews acoustic performance. This disc is is just two guys, Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. I'd never heard of Tim Reynolds before, but assumed Dave would only perform with the best. I am also an acoustic guitarist. Tim's playing was very fine. But I must admit he's not my favorite. He does some nice work with Dave, but this disc is a showcase for Dave Matthews. I've never heard Dave talk so much and he's very funny, entertaining and demonstrates both depth, as well as child like innocence besides being a real goofball. He was incredibly entertaining. The sound was as good as I've ever heard, the setting was stunning and the video was simply outstanding and entertaining in every way. Highly recommended!
I bought this CD version of this concert shortly after it was released and loved it. I recently bought an HDTV (Sony KDL-40W3000 40" 1080p LCD) and wanted to test out the BlueRay feature of the Sony PS3 I bought over the summer. I couldn't think of any BlueRay disk I'd rather own.<br /><br />Although I had heard every track from the performance several times, the entire concert was extremely entertaining. The camera work is great. The clarity (both audio and video) is the best I've ever experienced. And the music is... well, if your fan, and I bet you are... fantastic.
I own several concert DVD's / Blu-rays and SACD's<br /><br />- Bruce Springsteen - Seager Sessions<br />- Dido<br />- James Taylor: Live at the Beacon Theater<br />- Allison Kraus and Union Station<br />- Eric Clapton<br />- John Mayer<br />- David Grey<br />- Diana Krall<br />- Blue Man Group<br />etc<br /><br />Before owning this Blu-Ray, James Taylor: Live at the Beacon was my favorite DVD.  The 5.1 soundtrack on that concert was the best I had heard.  There was nothing distracting about it - the different channels blended seemlessly for an excellent and very relaxing experience.  I'm always on the look out for recording's like that.  I hate getting a DVD and being frustrated by poor mixing - usually in the surround channels; sometimes in the levels of the different instruments - Diana Krall in Paris is one example - something about it just didn't sit right with me.  The piano just seemed out of place in the soundtrack - not bad, just didn't fit together like I hoped it would.  Bruce Springsteen's Blu-ray is better but at times it can be difficult to set the surround speakers to the right level so that they don't become distracting.  The Dave Matthews Blu-ray is the best recording I've heard.  I listen to it over some highend speakers using the TrueHD soundtrack and it transports you into the concert hall for one of the best concert experiences you can get without actually being at the concert.  Its just two guitars and an occasional piano.  When Tim Reynold strums his guitar you hear every vibration and it is mixed about as perfectly as it can be with absolutely no distractions from the surround speakers (like too much ambience, etc).  I highly recomend this blu-ray to anyone looking for an incredibly well mixed soundtrack and songs that just about anyone can enjoy even if they don't know any Dave Matthews songs.  My second recomendation would still be JT (the original JT): Live at the Beacon
I own many Dave Matthews Band concerts on dvd. I like them all since I am<br />a fan, but the picture and sound quality are never both excellent at the same time. Here, on blu-ray, I finally am experiencing the best of both.<br />Dave and Tim play at Radio City. Basically, an unplugged concert with<br />two excellent musicians playing guitars. Dave does talk some in between songs. This is a pleasant surprise.  It is a long concert, but is<br />very enjoyable to watch and listen to because of the high definition<br />picture and sound. A must have for diehard fans and also a good choice for those who don't know anything about Dave Matthews.
Amazing.  Better then Luther College and it takes some doin to do that.<br /><br />If you are a Dave Matthews fan then you have to buy buy buy buy buy buy!
So much has been made of how great the image quality can be with Blu-ray, and this disc does not disappoint. This is a concert however, and this disc absolutely sets the standard for audio quality. The TrueHD surround simply has to be heard to be believed. Such clarity of sound with spatial detail I've only heard at an actual concert. Add to this that the performance itself is incredible and the mix of the 2 guitars and Dave's vocals is perfect. As much as I like DMB, I really prefer Dave in a stripped down format like this. Tim brings it to another level. Clearly a must have for the Dave Matthews fan, but even more so for any one that wants to really show the capabilities of a quality Blu-ray system. Simply spectacular...
My title pretty much sums it up.. If you really call yourself a fan of Dave Matthews, there is no question about purchasing this.. Dave and Tim epitomize true rock and roll love.. the passion they play with oozes into your living room.. I have a sharp aquos 42 inch 1080 LCD TV with full dolby 5.1 and I thought I was having a personal jam session in my living room. This is the best DMB item I have ever purchased (and I own every single album).
Watching this DVD is an almost transformational experience. I am very new to Dave Matthews and the DMB, but this DVD is absolutely wonderful. I would expect that almost anyone would enjoy this DVD. I was initially put off by some of the reviews that were peeved about Dave talking too much between songs. I was actually afraid to buy this DVD because I thought that too much talking would be a bad thing. I went ahead and bought the DVD and was VERY happy that I did!<br /><br />I agree that he can get wordy, but there is only one place in the concert that is a bit distracting; when he talks about his 'African' experience. Even this story is fine within the context of this particular concert. This concert DVD has such a nice atmosphere and actually draws you into the music. Now that I've seen the DVD several times, the talking is not distracting, but part of the concert experience. Of course, seeing this live would have been an absolute treat because it is really cool when musicians tell the audience what is on their mind.<br /><br />I have the music CD of this concert and the 'African' story is deleted. This is much better when listening to only the music. I wholeheartedly recommend both the DVD concert and the CD. I own a lot of DVD concerts and this might be my favorite.
All in all a great concert captured quite well on Blu-Ray.  Tim Reynolds is a phenomenal guitarist and his solos are quite entertaining as well as his work with Dave Matthews.  The Blu-Ray pircture is slightly soft but not distracting.  While I'd like there to be a bit more use of the surrounds, the Dolby TrueHD mix sounds very natural, not the least bit harsh.  Bottom line, the disk sounds great on Blu-Ray using the Dolby lossless mix.  I briefly tried the 2 channel PCM mix and it sounded quite good as well.  I'd have rated this disk 4.5 stars but this option is not available.
I'm a huge Dave Matthews Band fan and I must admit I was a bit skeptical about a Solo album. The band is so awesome, could Dave still perform at that incomparable level without them?? I heard so much about Tim Reynolds, would just another acoustic guitar be enough for my tastes in music? This I had to hear it, and I'm so glad I did.. This a must try DVD..<br />  When you first put this on you learn rather quickly that Tim Reynolds is not just another acoustic guitar player.. It's like listening to acoustic guitar on steroids.. He's a master with those pedals and finger slide. Great Sound.. If you have a good sound system with your TV you will be blown away with the sound. My Bose 3-2-1 system never sounded so good.. Close your eyes and it feels like they are in the room with you.. I'm sure playing in a great place like the Radio City Music Hall with it's great acoustics instead of some outside venue has a lot to do with this..<br />  The video quality is also excellent. Dave seemed a bit more intimate with the crowd than he normally is and he looked like he genuinely had a great time performing this gig.. The camera angles are great and the editing is superb.. I personally would rather watch this DVD than be front row center.. The disk says it was shot in HD but my HD DVD player would give me an error message saying in could not play in HD but converted to 480p instead. No big deal be cause it looked great anyway.. I'm wondering if a BlueRay disk player would work with it?? Maybe someone out there would try it and post a result..<br />  In all this is a "GREAT DVD" .. Even if your not a huge Dave Matthews fan you will be after viewing..
Ive been waiting to get this concert for a while, and it was well worth the wait. This is not only the best concert ive heard, but if your a Dave Matthews fan it makes that much better. The Dolby True-HD track sounds Amazing! Well worth picking up for anyone with a blu-ray player and a decent stereo.
Hands down the best Blu-ray concert out there. The audio and video are incredible. A must buy for Dave Matthews fans and even non-fans. I get shivers up my spine every time I listen to this concert.<br /><br />Well worth the asking price.
I am not a big Dave Matthews fan but WHAT A GREAT BLU-RAY SET this is. The audio and video are TRUE DEMO MATERIAL. I truly enjoyed the concert and Dave's little stories in between songs. I felt like I WAS THERE!
I am never disappointed with a DMB album, and this is no exception.  The music is high quality and throughly enjoyable.  So listen to this disc when you are in the car, at work or anywhere that you can listen out loud.
Video<br />------------------<br />1080p, VC-1<br /><br />Audio<br />------------------<br />English Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br /><br />Main feature<br />------------------<br />Stunning.<br /><br />With stunning video and audio, this is one of the finest releases on Blu-ray.  HD-DuD fans are drooling at the mouth right now, and rightfully so.
This is the third time I have bought this concert (once on iTunes, the DVD, and now this), and I must say I love it more every time I watch or listen to it. Dave's songs are given a new flavor and Tim's wonderful and unique guitar-playing ability gets recognition. In the blu-ray release you will see and hear everything. You will see ever scratch on Tim's guitar, and every whisker on Dave's face. The audio includes a TrueHD track and is pitch-perfect.<br />I cannot express to you how much you will enjoy this. This isn't a viewing, it's an experience. Lie back and enjoy.
This is hands down the best up close and personal live show with Dave Matthews you'll ever see. Tim Reynolds is just unreal, and his creativity on the songs is something i've never witnessed before. This show is well worth any cost. It will remain a favorite of mine for a long time to come!
So I've only watched about four songs so far, but let's talk about the audio. As others have said, it's awesome. The 96k version makes my speakers come to life. It's like they are musical instruments more than speakers. Some practically pull a muscle arguing there is no point in moving beyond the tried and true CD resolution of 44.1k/16 bit because no one can hear any difference. If you can't hear how transparent and buzz free this sounds compared to a CD, please ask your doctor for an audiology referral immediately. PS--I am not an audiophile, just an everyday music lover. Retina Display is great but let's see more Cochlea Display! 192/24 or death!
What a treat to watch this DVD, a real class act from Dave and Tim. Highly recommended and enjoyable to watch, would purchase more on these two together..Awesome!
One of my favorite Dave shows, the best rendition of Bartender period.  Great video, amazing audio, if you are thinking about getting it just do it; you won't regret it.
One of the best disc sets you can ever purchase. A must have for DMB or guitar lovers! Tim and Dave are a great duo and such an enjoyable listen.
I LOVE THIS CONCERT DAVE MATTHEWS AND TIM REYNOLDS ARE TWO INCREDIBLE MUSICIAN'S EVERY SONG ON HERE IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE IN AN ACOUSTIC SETTING AND THE AUDIO QUALITY OF THESE TWO DISC'S IS STUNNING THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CONCERT'S ON BLU-RAY THAT I OWN.
Tim Reynolds and Dave Matthews are such a great duo, and the extra's on the CD were good for a laugh and offered some insight into who these two geniuses really are.
Absolutely phenomenal live release. If you like Dave Matthews at all you will love this album. The only live album that beats it is Live at Red Rocks (1995).<br /><br />#41 on this album is the best version available of this song (well, maybe its tied with Live Trax 2 - San Francisco).<br /><br />Get. This. Album.
If you love Dave Matthews this is a must have. Turn the lights off in the room, put the disk in, and it's like your at the concert. Picture is amazing and the audio is even better. I would give it a 6th star if I could
Dave seems to be a pretty quiet guy. I, personally, like to hear musicians talk about their music. This concert has a very relaxed atmosphere and Dave tells some of the stories behind his songs. It is a great set for anyone who loves DMB and/or Tim Reynolds. I bought two copies after borrowing it from Netflix, one for myself and one for my brother.
thank you for shipping it so fast. i could only watch it once and then i took it home all the way to germany. it is great!
The BluRay is awesome, great audio and video. A must have for Dave's fans and a very good bluray concert to add to your collection. I'm pleased with this purchase.
This concert captures Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds at their best.  Two guys on acoustic guitars in sync displaying their amazing musical creativity.  Dave Matthews does all the talking in this video and if you've ever heard him speak, the guy oozes with creative artistry...no matter what he's doing be it music or talking about his trip to Africa.<br /><br />The video and audio quality of this video is also top noch.  It looks like film and the sound fills the room with a good system(I've got a Onkyo 805 and modified Monitor Audio RS-8's).  I've never before watched a video and felt the creative energy so alive as I do with this.  I'm mesmerized every time I put it on.  Enjoy.
PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE, LET US, OVER THE POND, HAVE THIS SUPERB BLU-RAY DVD ON REGION 'B'. IT APPEARS ONLY TO BE AVAILABLE ON REGION 'A'. IF ANYONE WITH ANY KIND OF CLOUT HAS THE POWER TO REMEDY THIS THEN PLEASE DO SO.....YOU WILL MAKE A LOT OF FANS OVER HERE(UK)VERY VERY HAPPY.
Perfect product.<br /><br />Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. Excellent purchase and service.<br /><br />Graciously<br /><br />Leonardo
If you are a Dave Matthews fan or just a fan of great music this is a must! Only downfall is I wish it was on 1 DVD as apposed to 2. Has some amazing Acoustic songs such as Cornbread, Eh-hee, classics like bartender, and crash into me, and some great guitar work by Tim Reynolds, I highly recommend this DVD, and if you want proof of how great this is,check out the song "Betrayal"
Love this- loads of Dave Matthews personality shines through in this live album. I found a new appreciation for him after listening to it for the first time. I listen to this album more than any of his others (I own all but the last album he put out).
Dave Matthews fans and music fans in general will not be disappointed by this live acoustic recording.  Dave and Tim mesh their guitars together beautifully as Dave gives lends his heartfelt vocals to his classic songs.
Quintessential Acoustic Guitar Concert!  Bought this as a gift for the wife.  She LOVES it!
This is so good. It sounds so clear. Its the reason you get a blu ray player and nice speakers. You can hear every note like you have never heard before.<br /><br />I have no clue why this isn't on the top 10 selling list.<br /><br />Do your self a HUGE favor and get this. Then get 3 more and give them out. Most used blu ray we have... by FAR!<br /><br />MORE PLEASE. MOREEEE BLU RAY DAVE!!!
Real simple, if you enjoy Dave Matthews and own a bluray player, you need to own this disc.  Plus Tim Reynolds is an amazing guitarist.  Buy it, you'll be happy you have this in the collection.  It's nice having a small get together with this disc play in the background.
This is an amazing concert, For anyone who is even remotely a Dave Matthews fan this is a most buy. Tim and Dave together I believe is one of the best duos of all time. I hope i get the chance to see them in concert together
Great quality audio and video here. Dolby True HD doesn't automatically default, so you need to set it in the home screen on each disc. Also, the quality of audio on the homescreen is very fuzzy and sounds terrible, however once you play the first song on the disc, the sound improves significantly. Video quality is outstanding in HD. Highly recommend if you like Tim Reynolds.
This was a great concert and sitting through the blu-ray makes me really wish I had been there.  I've always been a sucker for just a few guys and a few guitars and this blu-ray is a perfect example of that.  Dave Matthews is great as always but the true standout is Tim Reynolds.  Tim may be one of the most talented and underrated guitarists of his generation.  Somehow Tim has the ability to make his one guitar sound like 3 or 4 with the skill that plays.  The concert would be good enough on it's own, but the icing on the cake is the production value of the Blu-ray.  The video is almost to a point of being unnecessarily good, you can see the individual hairs on the guys heads on the closer shots.  The very best part of the blu-ray is the sound.  The blu-ray offers Dolby TrueHD and PCM audio at 96 KHz/24 bit.  I honestly didn't think it would make all that much of a difference, but the audio is the most spectacular that I've heard on any blu-ray or any concert cd, or even any concert that I've ever been to in person.  If you're a fan a just good old fashioned acoustic guitar music and have a blu-ray player with a decent sound system pick up this blu-ray, you won't be disappointed.
this album makes me dance. it is simply BEAUTIFUL - if you are a Dave fan, this is the Best....... of the best.... and i can't get over Tim Reynolds...he is absolutley magical. * * *
I liked the way Dave and Tim were doing with their guitars. It is amazing what you can do just with 2 guitars.<br />The blu-ray format is incredible.<br />I won't write too much about Dave's singing skill. There are plenty of them. But just assure you that you will not regret your purchase, if you like good vocal, realistic lyrics and good guitar playing...
if you like dave matthews and acoustical, you'll love this. Tim Reynolds is simply the best!
As promised, the cd was in good condition and I recived it on time.<br />Thank you.
The audio and video are superb. You ARE sitting inside these guitars. Its amazing. Put it on a 100 inch or bigger screen in HD with high resolution audio, and its pure heaven.
I love DMB so I have a bias to his music.  This concert is great but the Blu Ray picture and sound quality of this are UNBELIEVABLE!<br /><br />Amazon's price is the best and you won't be disappointed!
I previously only knew of Mr. Matthews from what I heard on the radio and I'd never heard of Mr. Reynolds.  My husband and I lucked into some cheap tickets for their show in Vegas and were blown away by the experience.  Consummate musicians!  So I ordered this CD and was very pleased with it.  Excellent introduction to their music, or if you're like most of the audience who knew all the words to the songs, you'll love it too.
Well i own this on DVD not blu-ray but the sound and the atmosphere of Radio City is just beautiful. Tim is  amazing as he makes it seem, if you close your eyes, that there are more than just 2 people playing. Dave is brilliant as always. His voice brings chills on most tracks such as "So Damn Lucky" and "Crush".<br />You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
I've thought for some years that Dave and Tim make a great musical duo. This DVD is simply fantastic. No big band, sax, keys, drums yadda yadda just straight up good guitar and vocals. Blu ray makes it all that much better.
This concert is just magical, Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds are perfection together. I've seen many musicians play the acoustic guitar but Tim Reynolds is a master! What he can do with a guitar is magical. You will not be disappointed purchasing this concert dvd, trust me.
Concert itself: 5 stars<br />Video quality: 5 stars<br />Audio quality: 5 stars<br />Extras: 3 stars<br />Others: The audio is simply perfect... but doesnt have low frecuencies for obvious reasons...
This is a review for the blu-ray edition.<br /><br />I've never been a big Dave Matthews fan and I've only heard [of] Tim Reynolds a few times. Watching this concert made me really appreciate the amount of talent and passion for music they both have.<br /><br />Audio quality is superb. The concert comes with 3 sound options: TrueHD 5.1, Dolby 5.1, and PCM stereo. I'm partial to stereo tracks, and therefore the PCM 2.0 on this disc, but the TrueHD track was also very impressive. You may as well not even bother with the Dolby 5.1 track. Video quality is also very good, but I wouldn't have cared either way - they nailed the audio on this disc and, to me, that's what's important for a concert.
Well, I should have bought it cd version instead of the blu ray. This is only me personal comment, to save some cash. Im sure the cd version's audio part is just as good its blu ray disk version.
I wanted to showcase my Home Theatre and I never got the perfect blend of audio and picture until now. This Blu-Ray shines. The picture is crystal clear and the audio and indescribable. I love this concert on DVD Blu-Ray. I was using the EAgles DVD, Hell freezes over to showcase my system. It was good but it was not HD audio , this is and the difference is hugh.
I have a decent collection of BluRay titles and this is one that I most frequently demo. The sound quality is crystal clear, with so much detail that you truly are there. The picture quality is also fabulous, with much detail even in the dark areas. Highly recommended.
Great show and great sound.  "Two Step" at the end will blow you away. I'm surprised Tim's guitar strings didn't explode and take out two rows of the audience with that one.
I'd gotten this for my fiance, who LOVES it for a Dave Matthews (minus the Band) performance.  What he and Tim Reynolds do together is nothing short of amazing, but of course she prefers the sound of the entire band.  This created a whole new level of appreciation for me, but if you're expecting the complete sound of DMB this isn't for you.
I have truly enjoyed listening to this CD.  It has many different versions of his most popular songs.  He has a great sense of humor in this particular performance, and the acoustics are sensational.  I believe anyone that likes Dave Matthews Band would enjoy this CD.
You get the entire 2.5 hour concert live from Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Its just like being there. I've been there so I know. The concert is acoustic, with both Dave & Tim playing acoustic guitars. It's "informal", you get to hear them tell stories about their songs, and their history. Also, both are great acoustic guitar players. Tim even plays some "slide" guitar play & Dave is an excellent vocalist. This dvd contains 21 Dave Matthew's classics on disc one. Plus another 5 classics on disc two. Then you get a bonus feature of a 46 minute behind the scenes documentary.<br /><br />This is a great 2 disc dvd, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!
I highly recommend this Blu-Ray disc.  The video and audio quality is superb and the performance is second to none.  Dave spends a lot of time talking to the audience between songs and the stories he tells are incredibly interesting.  This is a must for any Dave fan.
Just amazing, the quality of video, sound, camera angles and such is by far the BEST concert reproduction ever. I actually think the sound is way better than if at the concert itself. Weather a fan of DMB or not, this is a must for the people that appreciate accoustic guitar, Tim and Dave make a great pair.<br />I do not love DMB, too much noise, over produced.<br />But this, simple, elegant and powerful.<br />I purchased several, some sent as gifts.<br />thanks Dave and Tim, this was great
Live At Radio City with Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds is one of the best acoustic performances you'll find. There is over 3 hours of material on this disc, and over 2 hours of the concert as well.<br /><br />Personal favorites of this concert include the 9-minute rendtion of "Dancing Nancies" and the beautiful "Crush" Tim Reyonlds is a master of making the acoustic guitar sound funky, sometimes haunting at times during this concert.<br /><br />The latter half of the show seems even stronger than the first. "Cornbread", "Crash into me", and "Down By the River" is a consecutive masterpiece.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray looks great, sounds exceptionally well on a surround sound system, and will attract any music fan, familiar with Dave Matthews or not.
This is coming from someone who was fortunate enough to go to this show and watch it live first hand. it was a marvelous experience. dave covered a lot of his mainstream hit songs, as well as some other less-familiar to dmb fans versions of other songs. overall this album and my feeling during the show itself was that it has a little darkish/somber ring to it. it wasn't all happy blissfull music, and dave seemed stuck on a theme. i also remember dave having a bit of a soar throat that night but the performance from both him and tim reynolds was terrific! the sound quality is great and the gives you some of the best acoustic music. some standouts were 'crash', 'bartender', 'crush' and 'out of my hands'.<br /><br />I thought as a duo, the LUTHER COLLEGE album was a little better overall than this work, but any fans of soft acoustic music should definitely give this a listen.<br /><br />Other great live concerts from DMB worth checking out - PIEDMONT PARK and CENTRAL PARK. But LUTHER COLLEGE is best.
While I'm a big fan of DMB, for me it doesn't get any better than his solo-acoustic stuff (a la Farm Aid), or his acoustic duo's with Tim Reynolds (Guitar God).<br /><br />I could go on and on, but just buy this DVD if you love music, particulary acoustic-guitar music.  You won't find anything better on acousic guitar.<br /><br />I own MANY DVD concerts, including all of DMB's, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, Johnny Cash......  and this one is by far my #1.  I put in on all the time, even just for background noise while I'm in the house.  It never gets old.
Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds always put on a great show, this performance is no different. What makes this so fun to watch over and over is the quality of the video/sound. It's fantastic. You see so much detail, it's almost like being there. Minus the wonderful aromas... Blu-Ray was meant to deliver high quality video and audio. This one does. You will not be disappointed.
Okay I'm a Dave junkie, I'll admit that. Yeah I have all the albums all the live stuff and of course most of the concerts I've been to. I've been to 49 of his concerts so far. Got another one this week and have another one the week after. Rough schedule I know.<br /><br />  I'm buying this AGAIN on Blu-Ray because it seems that some of my family members think that they deserve this more than I do. I pre-ordered it though the fan club and a week after having it, it was snagged. So instead of putting up a stink I'll get a new one.<br /><br />  But this is a great set and has a lot of my favorite songs on it. If your a fan this should be in your collection it's an excellent set. I've watched it maybe 78 times so far and not bored at all. It's a great flick to throw in while cleaning or sitting around drinking with friends.
For being a casual Dave Matthews fan for many years, I thought this would be a reasonable purchase.  I have a large collection of concert DVDs and have decided to expand the collection to encompass Blu-Ray HD content playable on my Playstation 3 console. I was blown away by what this disc contains.  The high definition content and overall experience generated by this performance is truly spectacular! The audio track on this disc alone is enough to encourage anyone to purchase this title.  Stunning audio and video make this disc a favorite selection of mine time and again. Purchase with confidence.
I got the CD for Live At Radio City for Christmas, and was so blown away by the performance I had to get the video as well. After reading several reviews stating how great the quality of the Blu-Ray was, I decided to splurge and go with it instaed of the standard DVD... Boy am I glad I did. Both audio and video are pristine, and it feels like you are right there on stage with Dave and Tim. Now if only there were a video for Luther College, I'd be much happier.
As only a casual fan of Dave Matthews I wasn't all that excited about this disc at first.  Frankly, I bought it purely because it was Blu-Ray and had a high-def audio soundtrack as well.  Figured it would be a HT demo disc.<br />Well it is- at least twice a week !!!  I love it!!  The video is awesome.  The black levels as shown on the new Pioneer Elite Kuros make it look almost 3-D.  The soundtrack dynamic range is quite good.  Rarely is concert audio in 5.1 BETTER than well-mastered stereo, but it is here.<br />Now to the performance.  Great song selections.  The "music" these two generate with acoustic guitars is astonishing.  Tim Reynolds is awesome.  Let's just say I have purchased every disc of his now available.<br />It's truly a disc you should buy.  You won't be disappointed.
When I go to a DMB concert, I am almost always disappointed with the crowd. The last concert in Gainesville FL was a prime example, with the trashed kids next to us yelling out "Play something we know!" every time he ventured into new territory. To the many people who bad mouth his new music and only want to hear the old "Crash Into Me" songs, I say, open your ears. How many artists have produced as many songs and toured as many months on end as Dave Matthews? The music on this CD is for people who appreciate the huge variety of music and talent he offers. No, I don't like every single tract, but the songs I don't like might be your favorites. This CD reminds me of the concert I'd like to attend. The acoustical guitar work is amazing. Tim Reynolds is awesome. Take this CD on a long car trip and enjoy the road.
Not much to say apart from pure magic! What a concert! Video and Audio are amazing and the way the two musicians compliment each other is fantastic.
A must for any Dave fan! Tim and Dave put on a fabulous memorable show.
This CD is wonderful. I listened to it on my drive from Colorado to Chicago and I would play songs over and over. I highly recommend this CD. It's one of DMB's best live concerts!
the dvd has some material that wasn't on the cd.  some shaky camera work but overall it was a great show.
