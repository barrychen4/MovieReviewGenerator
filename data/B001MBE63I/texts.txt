Even for the non-opera loving public the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men.  But as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted Spanish director Vicente Aranda ('Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love','Amantes', 'If they tell you I fell', etc.).  Incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of Carmen from one of her lovers - Jos&eacute; - provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told.<br /><br />Carmen (the amazingly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper Jos&eacute; (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is stationed.  Carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that Carmen is a gypsy, Carmen murders the co-worker and is arrested.  Jos&eacute; is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen  and when Carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with Carmen.  Carmen keeps her pact, providing Jos&eacute; with his first sexual encounter, and Jos&eacute; is doomed.  His lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release Jos&eacute; encounters Carmen again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are Carmen's people. Many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over, behavior's that include Carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and Jos&eacute; comes to a tragic end.<br /><br />One factor that makes the story (as adapted for the screen by  director Aranda and Joaquim Jord&agrave; move so well is the role that Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e (Jay Benedict) plays: his questioning of  Jos&eacute; completes the story that Bizet's opera only outlines.  The acting is superb, the cinematography by  Paco Femenia  and the excellent musical score by Jos&eacute; Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. This is a must for lovers of the opera Carmen, and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 08
Paz Vega creates the steamiest Carmen ever in this gorgeous period drama. She brings the character to life. This isn't Bizet's Carmen, though. This one takes impulsiveness and fiery temper to extremes, and combines that volatile mix with a personality that seems to interact with others only to manipulate them. Then, with raw sensuality as her lure and reward, she brings out the same in men, not just poor Jos&eacute;.<br /><br />The settings come to life almost as much as the characters - that cavernous cigar factory at the start, the cities of nineteenth century Spain (but much older), and the rocky, raw wilds ruled by bandits. Award-winning costumes help too, including gaudy soldier's uniforms, and elaborate recreations of women's clothes, down to humble details like drawers.<br /><br />Don't expect to like these characters. Jos&eacute;'s military honor implodes, leaving a shell of murderous jealousy. Carmen herself - kissing a viper seems safer. Not even the lush promise of her body makes that look like such a good deal. Nice people don't make good drama, and these are very dramatic. Recommended, but not for the skin-shy.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
This film is an adaptation of the original story that the opera Carmen was based on. It has a great look ( very Goya in it's landscapes ) and it has an actress, Paz Vega, who is quite believeable as a woman who could make most fellows stray off the straight and narrow!!!<br />Well worth a look!
This film is an almost line-by-line retelling of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's short story Carmen, which, decades later, became the source of Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal&eacute;vy's libretto for Bizet's opera. The American DVD edition cover dutifully dumbs this down for our consumption: "based on Bizet's wildly popular opera".<br /><br />So much for ignorant marketing! At least, we get an anamorphic transfer -the Spanish edition is woefully letterboxed!<br /><br />Superb photography, beautiful actual locations, and Ms Vega, who is not at all shy about performing head-to-toe, full frontally and rearly **clothed** in more than one scene!<br /><br />What an eyeful!
i had to buy it after seeing it, i knew it would be a great movie since i had previously seen LOVERS & MAD LOVE both by Vicente Aranda, all beautifully presented with very well acted scenes and excellent taste music spots and of course Aranda's always honest and interesting style that shows historical movies without hypocrisy, that's why i also bought THE BORGIAS and would buy all of Aranda's movies.
I've never got to see Carmen on stage, but I always heard is a wonderful opera. I saw this movie and I bought it right away no questions asked. I just loved it. It was a very passionate movie and I just loved the fact that it was all in Spanish. BRAVO!
This is an extremely lush period piece, set in the early 1800's, that is modeled on the original novel that served as the basis for Bizet's opera. A Franco-British travel writer meets a strange bandit Spain, a seeming man of honor who shows mercy and a civilized intelligence, promising the writer that he will tell him his story if they meet again. This leads to one of those wonderful improbable adventures that is perfect for a film.<br /><br />Assuming that the reader would know Carmen's story, I will not attempt to avoid ***spoilers***. The thief, it turns out, was a serious young enlisted man in the Spanish Army, an inexperienced naif. In the adjacent cigar factory, Carmen disfigures a woman in a brawl and the soldier allows her to escape. This leads to his humiliation, their passionate involvement, and his descent into a hell of dishonor, suicidal jealously, and murder. The writer meets the man again in the city, and when he is incarcerated, he agrees to tell his story.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely superb. Vega is perfect as Carmen, a creature of sensuality, manipulation, and lack of human emotion. She is a destructive force that the young soldier cannot resist, even as he recognizes what she is. The soldier himself is completely convincing as the fool who cannot stop himself and would do it all over again.<br /><br />This is so believable it is agonizing to watch. Recommended with enthusiasm.
I should have read the description and reviews before ordering. I thought I was ordering the opera CARMEN, which I have loved since seeing it on television in the 1960s, even though I was a teenager and a fan of The Beatles and other pop/rock music. I've always had an open mind and loved all kinds of music.<br /><br />This is not a musical. It is a movie based on the storyline of the opera.  CARMEN is in Spanish, but has the option of subtitles in English as well as other languages. The film and sets are beautiful, as is the actress Paz Vega, who plays the part of Carmen.<br /><br />I can't give it less than four stars, because it is a very well made movie. I will now have to find a good version of the opera to order. I would appreciate any suggestions.
obsession, Desire, Love, Lust, Passion, Sexy Love scenes that inspire. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I want to find many more like this Film and (Mad Love)Juana la loca.
Although this is an old story played over, Paz Vega brings new excitment to it. It is truly entertaining and highly recommended.<br />The seller lived up to his promise of excellent condition and timely delivery.<br />Thanks
This is a very well directed movie, showing how a person can go from normal to outlaw to criminal by falling in love with the wrong woman, admirably played by Paz Vega. The action is all very credible, a testament to the quality of acting.  If you want to understand the concept of Femme Fatale, you should see it.
Wow,<br />  This is one of the sexiest women on the planet! You simply want o have sex with her continually over a 36 hour period! Have a short break and start all over again, smouldering hot!
Having gone to opera, I knew pretty much what was going to happen, but this movie really fleshed it out. There is a lot of nudity, but it makes sense ? I didn't mind reading the subtitles as I would rather hear their real voices instead.  Hard to believe a opera written in 1800's still stands up and is still current.  Actors were outstanding in their roles, I highly recommend this movie.
A very good telling of the story behind the opera, only, I missed not having the music from the opera.  Still a good story.  I also enjoyed Katerina Witt's Carmen On Ice.  I like the story.  Paz Vega WAS Carmen, I got her fire and her desperate life force.  Good stuff.
I enjoyed this for a reminder of the power of the original story.  The lighting, atmosphere, direction, setting all convey the primaeval intensity of the relationship between Jose and Carmen better than the subsequent opera.  Not that I don't love the opera, but the opera involves our senses and understanding via the music, in spite of the story.  This movie involves us because of the story.  Did I mention that it is primal?  Yes, it is primal.
This item was delivered on time and in excellent condition.<br />The actress who played Carmen was exciting and dangerous - just like the "carmen" character is supposed to be. I think she was the most interseting character in the movie.
Los puntos a favor de esta pel&iacute;cula son varios:<br />- Paz Vega es hermosa, y muestra bastante piel. Adem&aacute;s, act&uacute;a lo suficientemente bien para que las escenas er&oacute;ticas no parezcan gratuitas, incluso cuando algunas lo son.<br />- Leo Sbaraglia por fin se relaj&oacute; y abandon&oacute; sus pat&eacute;ticos esfuerzos por sonar castizo. Ahora simplemete habla en una especie de murmullo grave y de acento neutro, pero que al menos no distrae al oyente, y permite disfrutar de su considerable talento  actoral.<br />- El vestuario de &eacute;poca es lindo y detallado, especialmente los trajes t&iacute;picos de los contrabandistas sevillanos.<br />- La fotograf&iacute;a es excelente, como en casi todas las pel&iacute;culas espa&ntilde;olas.<br />- Joan Crosas, aunque act&uacute;a  en un papel relativamente peque&ntilde;o, lo hace con gran oficio.<br /><br />Pero, lamentablemente, estos puntos no bastan para redimir a esta pel&iacute;cula. Adolesce de las falencias que parecen aquejar a muchas de las producciones multinacionales europeas, en particular, la inserci&oacute;n de actores y situaciones que no agregan mucho al desarrollo de la trama.<br /><br />En efecto, la historia de Carmen se cuenta mediante el recurso del "relato enmarcado", empezando por el final, y por boca de una especie de arque&oacute;logo-humanista franco-ingl&eacute;s (Pr&oacute;spero, interpretado por el correcto Jay Benedict). Este recurso arruina cualquier suspenso que la la pel&iacute;cula pudiera haber tenido para aqu&eacute;llos no familiarizados con la &oacute;pera, y nos fuerza a esperar a casi la mitad de la pel&iacute;cula para que la acci&oacute;n comience a tener sentido.<br /><br />La acci&oacute;n es en general tan lenta, que la pel&iacute;cula recurre, de manera un tanto barata, a los desnudos de la hermosa Paz Vega (o su doble de cuerpo) para mantener el inter&eacute;s.<br /><br />El vestuario, aunque vistoso y bien investigado, demasiado a menudo tiene ese aspecto de "demasiado nuevo, brilante y almidonadito" que le resta credibilidad.<br /><br />Las escenas de lucha y tiroteos, en general son anticlim&aacute;ticas y est&aacute;n pobremente coreografiadas. En particular, una muy importante lucha con navajas es tan mala que da risa m&aacute;s que provocar suspenso.<br /><br />Finalmente, como es una constante en casi todas las pel&iacute;culas espa&ntilde;olas, el sonido es malo. Se usa un registro de volumen muy amplio, que va desde actores apenas susurrando en baja intensidad, a partes musicales de volumen mucho m&aacute;s alto que saturan. &iquest;Por qu&eacute; este detalle t&eacute;cnico contin&uacute;a arruinando las pel&iacute;culas espa&ntilde;olas? &iquest;No hay buenos t&eacute;cnicos de sonido en Espa&ntilde;a?<br /><br />En suma, con los recuros y el talento invertidos en esta pel&iacute;cula, podr&iacute;a haberse logrado un producto final mucho m&aacute;s atractivo. Una l&aacute;stima.
