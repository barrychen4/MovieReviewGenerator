One Of The Two Best Samurai Films Ever Made!
A Flawed but Enjoyable Epic
Loyalty
The Quintessential Japanese Saga
One of Masterpieces - both actors' play and plain beauty!
Japan's National Story
Samurai honor, political intrigue, romance, brilliant cinema
great movie...bad dvd
A Classic of Japanese Film
A horrible transfer - Image needs to fix it (this movie deserves better)
"Lord Kira, Prepare To Die": Classic Film About Loyalty!
Sheer greatness
Quintessentially Japanese
Great Museum Tour, Faulty Film
Product Arrived as Advertised
A Most Expensive Debacle
Like the cherry blossom, this film doth fall from my movie library...
Valorous and powerful tale of heroism
