An exellent DVD, featuring all the great players of past and present, full of highlights interviews and exellent story line,<br />describing each of an ultimate player's skill, like scoring, speed, mentality, etc. Exellent music to go with the story, and the final highlight featuring michael jordan could'nt be better (even thou I'm a Laker Fan), wich made me also order ultimate jordan eventualy.
Talking about music, would anybody be expert (and kind) enought to help me on that : what's the name of that GREAT Funk piece of music, kind of guitar, drum & piano stuff, playing when they are showing all those great shots and moves by George "Iceman" Gervin, Michael Jordan and Dr J ? it's between the 17'00" and 18'40" time in the documentary.<br /><br />thanks a lot to anybody who can help me. :p
