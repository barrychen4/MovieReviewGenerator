I swear maybe I should change my name to the 3D nut cause it seems like thats all I ever review on!!!<br /><br />Shock Labyrinth was not a bad movie at all. I can see why some reviewers might have been a little confussed at times. I had to watch it twice to really pick up everything in the story and there is a lot of back and fourth with flashblacks. So in other words when watching this film you really have to pay attention or you could be missing out on a key thing in the movie. It really wasnt a bad movie at all and the acting was above decent I felt. If you like the wierd twist that you see in a lot of those asian suspense horror films then you will probably enjoy this one too.<br /><br />Now for the area I usually love the most...The 3D!!!!!<br /><br />The 3D in this movie was decent but with some flaws. There is a nice bit of shadowing in some scenes but then you will have very clear shots in other scenes, i guess the phares "mixed bag" is the best way to discribe the 3d in this. It's not by any means horrible and does bring some more fun to the movie. There are a few fun pop out scenes and some shots with some really great depth to it then some scenes not so much. I dont think this was a bad buy at all for me and to be honest i am not that huge of a fan of the asian suspense horror.But over all I did enjoy this one a lot.If you are a fan asian 3D horror I would also recommend "childs eye 3D" and even more so "Sector 7 3D" which has fantastic 3D in it.
"Shock Labyrinth" really only has it's boffo title and packaging going for it. Everything else about the movie fails to deliver.<br /><br />The plot...well, apparently a group of friends visit a spooky fairground attraction as children and there is some kind of accident in which one of the girls vanishes. Then, 10 or so years later the same friends find themselves tricked into going to an abandoned hospital, which then turns into the same funhouse from their past, and they re-live the frightening experience all over again, possibly as part of the twisted revenge of the missing/dead girl.<br /><br />That might have worked as a plot, in fact on paper it looks pretty good, but watching this movie is absolutely no fun at all. There is but a single key event in the movie, which is that somebody falls over the handrail and down the well of a spiral staircase. Believe it or not, the whole film is constructed to dwell on this one event in as many ways as it is possible. First we see the original accident, then we see it again from another view, then we see other characters go through the same event either as witnesses or as victims themselves, sometimes in their childhood and sometimes in their adult states. The film thinks it's clever in mixing the evens of the past with the present, but it doesn't hold any suspense whatsoever, it just looks like a bunch of kids running in circles and then a bunch of adults running in circles again. The so-called shocks of the labyrinth are provided by (wait for it) a white toy bunny and a yellow balloon with a smiling bumble bee on it. Shots of the bunny in particular are wheeled out interminably, not that a single shot of it provokes any feelings of fear whatsoever. At no point in the film does anything approaching scary happen. Not in one single minute of it, and therefore I count "Shock Labyrinth" as a total failure to entertain.<br /><br />By the way, you might pick up the DVD that comes with both 3D and 2D versions, but if you think the 3D will rescue it, think again. It's totally unwatchable, I only lasted about 1.5 minutes before yanking off the 3D specs and sticking the 2D version on.<br /><br />What a shame.
Shock Labyrinth was an okay Japanese movie. I wouldn't call this a horror movie, it's more like a suspense movie. So if you're expecting something like The Ring or The Grudge, you're going to be disappointed.
This is a interesting ghost movie about revenge. Or is it? that's what you have to decide in this movie. Is it all in one mans mind? Is it a ghost or spirit coming for revenge?  I liked that part of it. Even though it's sort of confusing like a labyrinth! Ok, that's cool. But the 3d goes from exceptional with great depth and beautiful scenes to the next scene where there's suddenly alot of ghosting, and crosstalk. where you see a light with two more lights around it. Then the next scene is great. This was shot in 3d and the problem was with the mastering to blu ray.  How they released this with so much problems is beyond me. This reminds me of 'dinosaurs alive' but that one had mostly good scenes ,and then some ghosting. and parts of 'pirhana 3d" but those were a few scenes this is about half of the scenes in this one!  It's disturbing to the eye because if you wear contacts like me , I thought my lens were doing it, but they aren't after all , one scene is great, then the next is ghosting. This has extras on it;including interviews. If you like sorta confusing deep ghost stories then this is a good one but the 3d is problematic. ONe minuate you are in awe of how good the picture is with great depth and then you have two ears on a man!.  I probably should give this one star because they did a bad job on this blu ray in 3d. the 2d looks fine, but the movie was interesting and you did half the scenes looking great.
*Review of 2D version.<br />The Shock Labyrinth is a horror film about a group of teens that get stuck in a labyrinth from their past after trying to help a friend (also from their past). It's creepy and fun, but not very scary. Overall, it's definitely a great way to kill time.<br /><br />What did I like? It's creepy and fun, like I previously stated. It moves at a very fast pace. The acting was about average. I definitely enjoyed the music. What I liked the most though was the make-up/effects on the "props", they're especially creepy and scary when they start to move. I like that it tried to be innovative in the way it told the story. There are probably 1 or 2 great scares. The ending was also decent, but you may be able to predict it.<br /><br />What did I dislike? It doesn't have as many great scares as you'd expect knowing the director and origin.  And, although it's innovative, the storytelling is sometimes all over the place. It also has some cheesy special effects. Builds a good amount of tension, but it doesn't really lead to anything. Basically, it's not really scary, but often creepy and tense.<br /><br />The Shock Labyrinth is a decent film, but it's just not as terryfing as it could've been. Go in with low expectations, and you'll most likely kill an hour and a half while having a fun time. As of 7/7/12, it is available on Netflix Streaming if you really want to watch and save some money.<br /><br />This movie has some violence and blood, no sex or nudity.
movie was ok,3D was ok,though it was little better in 2D.couldn't get into movie as much.it was an intresting product.
"Shock Labyrinth 3D" revolves around a group of childhood friends who share a tragic and dark secret. Their friend Yuki went missing 10 years earlier in a haunted house attraction they snuck into. One night, the lost child shows up as an adult at her friends' front door, frightened and still dressed the same way she was when she disappeared. The group decide to take her to the hospital and upon arriving discover they are locked in the abandoned building with something or someone sinister playing with their minds.<br /><br />Shimizu has a way with pulling you into his films and getting you emotionally involved. He takes you through all sorts of different emotions, from fear to sadness to empathy all in a 90 minute time period. His work goes so much deeper than what American viewers have seen with his "The Grudge" movies.<br /><br />Consumers and fans of intelligent horror films will love the "Shock Labyrinth 3D" Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack. The movie is an atmospheric and claustrophobic journey through the darkest parts of a person's mind. The fact that it was shot in the actual "Shock Labyrinth" haunted house attraction in Japan helps with the distinctive character of the film. Besides a great movie available in both 2D and 3D, this has some impressive special features that make the whole package a worthy purchase.
The movie:<br />Hard to understand it. Lots and lots of weird stuff going on in the story line. You have to be into this sort of drama to get into it. I guess I am not.<br />___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />3D effects:<br />Loads and loads of crosstalk. I have an high-end 3D TV. the crosstalk was way too much. As a matter of fact, this is one of the worst movies that I have because of the ghosting that is going on.<br /><br />Recommendations to my friends? Probably not.<br /><br />Recommendations to my enemies? Oh yeah.<br /><br />Will I loan this to my brother to watch? I'll give a warning, but if he wants to watch it, then who am I to deny him the fun of being disappointed.<br /><br />Would I loan it to my best friend? Hell yeah... pay back is a dog!
I agree totally with Mr. Bothelo.I found this little gem at Best Buy for $20.Like he said,the 1st night I had trouble staying awake reading sub-titles and all.However,even though I was geting kinda sleepy I noticed the 3d was good(ghostey at times though)and that why i bought the 3d tv and blu-ray 3ds for,good 3d.I'm glad I stuck with it,it was creepy,but complex,so i'll probabaly watch it again.Its a Japanese horror/ghost film decently done with good color,depth,and good 3d.I've spent much more on critically acclaimed 3d movies that I did not enjoy as much as this one.A classic ?? Not by any means,but worth $20 if you buy 3d blu-rays.
I did not expect much from this film from the get go. The price (under $20) and the lack of accolades had me believing that this was going to be a mediocre film at best. I was wrong.<br /><br />I will admit: For the first twenty minutes of this film, I fought hard to stay awake. I even had to nudge myself a few times to avoid slumber.... But thankfully I did not succumb. Once Shock Labyrinth 3D begins to get rolling, it becomes a wonderfully twisted, bizarre film. Director Takashi Shimizu (The Grudge, and Ju-On) once again masterfully creates a film that plays on ones fears and insecurities. By the end of the film, I walked away feeling distraught. Kudos Takashi!!!<br /><br />The 3D of Shock Labyrinth 3D represents both the best and worst the technology. At times (but not too often) the 3D is so blurry it becomes hard on the eyes. At other times it stands so far out in front of your face, objects look like they are floating in your living room. Another minus aspect to the 3D is the use of subtitles. Since the film is in it's original Japanese language, you tend to miss some key 3D moments because your eyes are focused on the subtitles. Thank heavens for a rewind button!!! Still, I recommend this film to only be watch in 3D. If you watch it in 2D you will be missing the full effect of this film.<br /><br />Is this film worth the 20 bucks? Absolutely. If you are a fan of top notch Japanese horror films don't miss Shock Labyrinth 3D.
Takashi Shimizu is one of those talented and gifted directors that has the ability to chill audiences to the bone. "Ju-on" and "Ju-on 2" will stick with you long after watching them. "Marebito" was pretty good. "Reincarnation" is where things begin to go mainstream. Talented and gifted Asian horror film directors like the Pang Brothers, Hideo Nakata, Ahn Byung Ki and others seem to be more interested in going mainstream than doing what they do best and chilling us to the bone. In the case of "The Shock Labyrinth 3D", I was shocked (no pun intended) at how Takashi Shimizu has gotten away from his talent and gift and created this non-scary borefest. The film is not abysmal but it is nothing like his earlier work. The Pang Bros. followed suit with their 3D film "The Child's Eye 3D" which was also a disappointment. "Ju-on White Ghost" and "Ju-on Black Ghost" are decent but made by other directors under the careful eye of Takashi Shimizu; so I read. This is why people are saying that Asian Horror films have gotten stale. But, alas, three films have come out recently that prove otherwise: South Korea's "The Cat" aka "Two Eyes That See Death, Hong Kong's "Womb Ghosts" and South Korea's "Epitaph" are all some good work with "Epitaph" being the most powerful of the three. Parkpoom Wongpoom and crew from Thailand scared us with "Shutter" and "Alone". Hopefully they have something big coming soon. I am looking forward to watching Oxide Pang's "Sleepwalker 3D" with the lovely and talented Lee Sinje. But back to "The Shock Labyrinth 3D". The film has a few creepy moments that have that Takashi Shimizu feel to them but otherwise the film is just boring and not really scary; "Ju-on 2" was SCARY. I am concerned about the quality of his follow up "Rabbit Horror". I read that Shimizu was also making a film using his cellphone; which should be interesting. Asian horror creators need to get back to what made Asian Horror film seekers, like myself, seek out their work. I was so inspired by the Pang Bros. film "The Eye", South Korea's "A Tale of Two Sisters", Ahn Byung Ki's "Phone", Thailand's "Shutter" and South Korea's "Memories of Murder" that I started going to film school over a year ago and now I am in pre-production for my second film. I will buy the blu-ray/dvd combo for "The Shock Labyrinth 3D" because I am a supporter and a fan of Takashi Shimizu and I support Well Go Usa in all their work bringing incredible Asian films like "Ip Man" to U.S. shores. "The Shock Labyrinth 3D" bosts a decent production value and some cool scenes but don't expect a top notch 3D presentation. As far as 3D goes, the Pang Bros. should release their masterpiece "Re-cycle" in 3D. Now that would be real cool. One other problem to note, there are many copycats of Asian Horror films that have jumped on the bandwagon that are making mediocre films like "Otoshimono", "Red Eye", "Face", "Yoga", "Cello", "The Wig", "Coming Soon", "The Locker", "Arang" (one of the better ones) , "Ghost of Mae Nak", "The Maid", "Hair Extensions", "Sigaw" (one of the better ones) and many others that have virtually watered down the impact of Asian Horror films. There have been some decent ones like South Korea's "Haunters" and "Blind" and Thailand's "4bia" and "Phobia II" that have come out though. Personally, I think it is time for the masters like Hideo Nakata, Pang Bros., Takashi Shimizu, Ahn Byung Ki, Shusuke Kaneko, Parkpoom Wongpoom and the rest to get back to the basics of their incredible talents and gifts and scare the heck out us again.
