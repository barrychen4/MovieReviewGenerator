This is a good movie based on a real life story.  Sugar Valentine is the perfect example of "po pimpin'."  He lives in a one bedroom or possibly a studio apartment.  There is no food in his kitchen, he is even eating instant oatmeal.  His only hoe is blind (no joke, she is blind), and in the beginning of the film his hottest hoe, Naomi leaves him alone.<br /><br />Sugar isn't mean, he isn't frightening.  He even writes poems--yes a pimp who writes poems and reflects on his life and feeds ducks.<br /><br />Sugar comes from a long line of pimps, and his daddy is in the hospital very ill.  Sugar tries his best to pay his fathers hospital bills.  Sugar is a bum.  He has a nice car, but his look is all wrong for the pimping game--now his brother has big muscles, flashy car, well groomed and a nice spot to rest his head.  His brother is doing good in the pimpin game.  The story takes an interesting turn when Sugar gets involved with a renegade how that has no pimp and claims she is on the streets in LA looking for her runaway sister.  A very good film, even though it was low budget, it was awesome in my eyes.  The story was very well told.
This movie is okay. Its low budget, but the story line is great! I would rent it first before I buy it. Its based on a true story!
For my taste this is movie for oscar award definitely!<br />&#1058;rue pimp story buddy, got this and you will not regret.
High quality movie, this would agree several! The good stuff here is that this is based on true story, i recommend this one!
I am big fanboy of this kind of movies and i must say - from now this is my favorite!<br />Strongly recommend to everyone!
I think Sugar Valentine was a great movie, besides for the fact that was based on a true story, this movie was written in a perfect way so that you would follow it and like it all. Overall I think it was a great movie.<br />*Sponsored Post
sugar valentine was not pimp material, and yes i have a bunch of pimp movies but overall it was a good view and worth the price.<br /><br />sugar valentine brings po' pimpin' to reality...<br />that's all i can say about him<br />but there was drama and some more in this movie and if u like pimp flicks then this is one u should see; however sugar valentine will lack the glamour u seek in such films.<br />since it was based on a true story it makes it all more the interesting espcially since they have the real sugar valentine appear at the end
Sugar Valentine was a good movie that needed to tell the story and little bit more. It left you wondering what happened in between because it is a true story.<br /><br />Sugar was a broke pimp that was trying to get his game back and in the meantime he fell in love with an undercover cop that took the little bit of his pimp game away.
