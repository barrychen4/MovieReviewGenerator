Unquestionably a classic film, but...
By Far,  Still One of the Creepiest Moovys Ever Made.....
The world is brutal, but who knows it?
A neat reworking of a subgenre
Love it or Leave it - That's the beauty
Stunning

A disturbing vision of Americana
David Lynch's masterpiece
In dreams.
A Shocking Masterpiece

The Best Film of the 1980's

To think I used to HATE this film...
As coherent as it needs to be.
A CLASSIC MASTERPIECE

Great Movie
Necessary Lynch
Lynch's masterpiece, all other opinions and perspectives are void
Dennis Hopper is great!!!!!
NO RESOLUTION!
Artful, surreal portrait of the normal and the deviant
Good for renting but not for collecting..
One of the most important chapters in modern americancinema!
Right brain vs left brain-&gt; everyone wins!
Brilliant, fun, wacky, sublime. Best of the 80s.
This movie is so hard to discuss...
The worst DVD encoding - ever!
Begins Well, but The End Looses Steam

LYNCH'S MASTERPIECE
a masterpiece??- i think not
Confusing
Warm and Fuzzy!!
Very unsettling and confusing movie!
a comment on the DVD (not the film - which is brilliant btw)
Art thou entertainment?
I know the suburbs, and this isn't the suburbs
Dennis Hopper, the two stars are for you
Not classic
Fun for the whole Family!
This is only comparable to Lynch's other movies
Good plot, direction, and scenes, but some bad acting.
Blah, blah, blah
Dennis is the reason I gave it 2, otherwise 1 star
WELL...IT'S GOT ALOT OF PRETTY COLORS.
Overrated Drivel
about the movie blue velvet...........
the way
This movie was BAD with a capital "B"
Weird film
Coming of Age and loss of innocence.
Faux-Bizarre Failure
A Masterpiece? NO way
Isabella Rossellini!
Waste of Time
The Citizen Kane of bad movies
Great Movie
Unseemly, Nasty and Rank
This 'Masterpiece' is the Perfect Example of Bandwagon Overrating
Bad bad movie
Mediocre DVD Release of an Important Film
