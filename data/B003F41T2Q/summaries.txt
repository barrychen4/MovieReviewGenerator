This is a music video, not an Elmo video
A pre-bed favorite
Not for everyone, but very well done!
Excellent Kids video!!!!
Where is Elmo?
Not the best video in our collection
Might be better for older kids -- my husband & I liked it though
Too much Rosie
An outstanding DVD with lasting appeal for kids!
Music with Elmo/Sesame Street as an afterthought
great video- jon stewart an extra plus!
Bogus Elmo Video
Great family dvd!

Incredibly BAD!!!
Kinda Hip for Kid Vid...
Good for grown-ups
It's okay.  I think I liked it more than my son.
Rent it Before You Buy It
Major disappointment
Not good
NICE BOX COVER
Dated and disappointing
Absolutely Love This One!
JUST ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS
Sesame Street, always a winner!
