The Movies are Great classics and that is the only reason I did not send them back.<br />They could had done a better job on recording to the DVDs.<br />Video and Audio Quality was some what ok on 2 or 3 movies, but even then they looked as if they use no Contrast,and a continually alot of spotty snow, crackle audio.
I was a little disappointed by the brevity and lack of substance or suspence. But these movies were made a long time ago and I did enjoy seeing the great stars from that era.
