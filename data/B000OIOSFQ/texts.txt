This video is awesome. New Hot talented artists performs hip-hop, r&B, and reggae at a club in North Carolina tears up the stage. There are interviews with Fayetteville's top radio station Disk Jockeys and much more. I love The Spot Review show! It's like a breath of fresh air. If you are tired of seeing the same faces in the music industry on TV, you need to check out this show.
