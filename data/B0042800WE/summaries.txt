Steaming in the wrong direction...
Kinda Different, if you know what I mean.
2 year old says "Meh."
Not the Thomas I knew
Very fun and animated!
Looks good but there are so many "ugh" moments
Misty Island perhaps worst Thomas movie to date
Suspense, Thriller....Kids Version!
Very poorly developed
Nothing but a Commercial, just in time for Christmas!
Super-annoying movie that children LOVE
The ONLY thing that can keep my 2-year-old quiet for a good 50-minutes
Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue
It was a hit!
Ok for Thomas Fans
My 3 y/o and 5 y/o sons loved it.
Too scary for my 3 year old
Don't do it!! It's not the same Thomas
Scary Scene, Silly New Characters, Catchy Song, Animated Faces -- Just OK
Will Gladly Add To Our Thomas Collection
Awful
