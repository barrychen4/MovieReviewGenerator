The last special released in the Thomas franchise was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E9HML0">Thomas & Friends: Hero of the Rails</a>, the first fully-animated feature with our #1 tank engine. I was impressed how it was down-to-earth, kept things as realistic as possible, and showed real character development and personality, leading for good morals for children to learn. It was everything a parent and child would want, instead of something bland and colorful that parents could sit their kids in front of while they went off to do other things.<br /><br />Misty Island Rescue, on the other hand, is none of those things.<br /><br />The film starts off with Thomas helping to build the brand new Sodor Search and Rescue Center. Special wood from far away, called "Jobi wood", is needed to build it. Diesel tries to take the wood himself, but ends up almost crashing; Thomas saves him, but all the wood is lost in the sea. Sir Topham Hatt is proud of him, and as a special award, he arranges for Thomas to visit the Mainland to visit the Search and Rescue Center there. Along the way, Thomas's raft breaks away from the ship, and he end up on a faraway place called Misty Island, where he meets strange engines called Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand. Meanwhile Sir Topham Hatt hears Thomas has gone missing, and orders a search with the help of Harold the helicopter and Captain, the new lifeboat.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, the first thing that's readily apparent is that all four of the new characters are completely uninspired and made purely for children's merchandise. Captain only gets a good three lines through the whole film. Bash and Dash are just obnoxious, especially their voices. Ferdinand, who should have had a bigger role, is reduced to saying "That's right!" through the whole film. In Hero of the Rails, the three new characters (Hiro, Victor, and Kevin) are all beautifully fleshed out and made likable to the audience. But the four new characters here get absolutely no character development, no real reason to be liked.<br /><br />The narration and voice acting is even worse. It's filled with more rhymes than a Dr. Seuss book, making it feel as if the story's being told to a newborn baby. Originally, the Thomas series was famous for never talking down to kids, but this film has lines reduced to "That is very bad, and I am very cross!" when the (impressive) CGI is more than capable of show the needed emotion. Michael Brandon returns as the narrator. While he does an excellent job as always, sometimes lines are spoken when simply letting the character speak for themselves would have worked much better.<br /><br />The story is merely okay. Bash, Dash, Ferdinand, and Captain all take a backseat to letting Thomas run the show, leaving no chance for any of them to appeal to the audience. So very many things were unrealistic, such as Thomas's crew riding with him on the raft in the middle of the ocean, an underwater tunnel made of wood and being used by steam engines...the list goes on. Misty Island is never really explained...it just seems to be there like a wooden amusement park. As for as morals go, what the story tries to tell is that "you don't always make the right decisions, so listen to others!". But there's a particular scene early in the film when Thomas outright insults Diesel ("Only a really useful STEAM engine can take the logs! You'll never be that!") and he's never called out on it by anyone.<br /><br />On a more positive note, the CGI has greatly improved, and Nitrogen Studios, once again, shows their work in creating a living, detailed environment. The Sodor Search and Rescue Center looks fantastic. Misty Island, although looking unrealistic in terms of how real railways work, looks unique and interesting. You'll even notice cameos by other engines who haven't been around, such as Stanley and Butch. Whiff and Salty also return to play roles in the film. I can't complain about the background music. While it's not the same leitmotifs from the original show, the music still fits well with the film.<br /><br />Overall, Hero of the Rails was a step forward, but Misty Island Rescue was two steps backwards. One of the original charms of the original stories and show was that it could appeal to both parent and child; Wilbert Awdry sympathized with parents who had to read through ridiculous stories to their children, and wrote the Railway Series with hopes that parents could enjoy the stories too. Misty Island Rescue looses that charm; dull, uninspired characters, a ridiculously unbelievable story, and a repetitive narrative will drive the adult far away into another room.
I'm raising my twin grandsons who will soon be three and we own just about every "Thomas The Train" DVD out. I had been waiting for several months for the release of "Misty Island Rescue," with full understanding that, unlike the old offerings, this would be 100% animation. The actual DVD is of decent quality, however, the storyline is as strange as it can get. THIS IS A RATHER DARK FEELING DVD,(not quite Tim Burton, but headed in that direction). By that I mean it lacks the warmth I generally associate with Thomas stories throughout the years. Aside from several familiar characters, it doesn't even feel like it's taking place in Sodor. (A real twist, when you discover that Misty Island and Sodor are actually, but confusingly connected.)<br /><br />If I had to come up with one word to describe this particular Thomas The Train DVD, it would have to be "WEIRD!!!" This is confirmed by Twins who don't want to view it again. Mind you, they always watch every one of the other DVD's again and again and again. Sorry to say, they clearly don't care for this offering.<br /><br />I rated this a "3 out of 5," only because the over animation is good. It certainly wasn't what I thought it would be.
This is not a bad story, but it drags.  It could easily fit into half an hour and be more enjoyable.  There are some nice moments of friendship and good values, my son really likes Cranky the Crane and Whiff, and I do like the new animation and the way the characters do more of their own dialog than the old style-- it develops the characters well.  However, there were too many repetitions of Thomas's "I make good decisions" mantra, too long spent dithering around on Misty Island with creepy/kooky Bash and Dash, and too many truly suspenseful/dangerous situations, which all combined to make my 2yo son simultaneously anxious and bored.  Not what I hope for when I pop in a Thomas movie!  Perhaps for an older child it would be more engaging, and we'll stick to the shorter classic episodes until he's ready for longer movies.  I'm glad I tried the Amazon video on demand version before buying it, that's a great way to preview without the expense and cutter of owning yet another movie that won't get watched.
My 4 year old boy had many questions while watching this DVD.  The most troublesome of all was how did Thomas get off the raft and onto land?  Did the tracks come right up to the water?  Did the Logging Locos have drivers, signal men, and men to tend to their fires and made sure they had coal?  I think the new showrunners, as someone else has called them here, are underestimating the intelligence of their audience and this is a sad turn of events.  The original Thomas was smart and stayed true to how a railway actually worked.  This new Thomas just throws that out the window.<br /><br />One thing I always loved about Thomas was there was never a bad or inherently evil character.  Sure some of the Engines would say rude or mean things (James, Gordon)but in the end they always learned their lesson and were apologetic.  At the end of the credits Diesel 10 ominously appears from behind a mountain and speaks some scary words with a cackle.  Since he was not featured at all in this movie this is obviously a hook for a future DVD.  Diesel 10 has been part of the Thomas cast for some time and he has always been an intimidating character, yes.  But he was never scary or seen as evil as they are trying to portray him now.  I am not pleased with this new direction for Thomas and his friends.<br /><br />This movie is basically just a big commercial for the Trackmaster Set which will cost you $50. or the Take & Play set for the Xmas season.  The worst part is that there is zero attempt to hide the fact that this is just a movie made to hawk toys.  Character development is nonexistent and the dialogue is super simple.  One of the characters just says the same thing over and over.  "That's right". My kids are bored with it already.<br /><br />Note to the producers and directors of The new Thomas movies:  Children are young humans with working brains and can be highly intelligent.  Just because they are young doesn't mean they are stupid.  Thank you.
My sons loved this DVD and I have a feeling we will be watching it for awhile.  The first thing that pops out is the CGI animation and how neat all the trains and everything looks.  Now my sons never really watched Thomas & Friends until the CGI animated films came out but I think the new animation really makes everything "pop!"  As always the DVD features great lessons including:  asking for help, being positive, working together, no one is always right and taking responsibility for one's actions.  I always try to point these out to my 3-year old to see if he understands.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great DVD to add to a Thomas & Friends collection or for any child that loves trains.  Oh and there are a few new trains in this DVD just as there were in the last Thomas & Friends movie "Hero of the Rails."  The narrator, Michael Brandon, does an excellent job and the movie flows nicely for almost an hour!  I really can't see a child not liking this DVD, especially if they are ages 2-5, which my boys fall into.
My 3 year old fell in love with Thomas after watching some of the television episodes.  We soon discovered a big difference in the older (filmed model) episodes and the animated episodes:<br /><br />- The engines in the old series are always cranky and participate in mean spirited behavior<br />- The engines in the new series are mostly happy and friendly and make mostly naiive mistakes that they repent and want to fix<br /><br />The Hero of the Rails feature was really good.  Thomas finds a broken down, hidden Hiro and helps rebuild him.  You instantly like the new characters, Victor and Kevin. Victor is thoughtful and helpful, Kevin has the dropsies but tries really hard.<br /><br />Then there's Misty Island Rescue, which I'd see as the next evolution of Thomas and Friends.  By that I mean it changes / expands the Sodor universe.<br /><br />The animation is great.  The story, however, has so many "ugh" moments that I'm left disappointed. Surely the writers could have come up with something better?  My 3 year old loves Misty Island as much as he loves any Thomas, but I am bothered by many things:<br /><br />1) Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand, the new engines ("logging locos"), are annoying and childish. Heck, even Thomas annoyed me.<br />2) They talk about Misty Island as this spooky mystery, yet it's a nearby island (within view but mysteriously shrouded in mist 100% of the time so that nobody remembers seeing it). That is, 100% of the time EXCEPT when Thomas does something pigheaded and the mist disperses, allowing those on Sodor to see his distress signals...<br />3) Hiro says Jobi wood is only found in his homeland (supposedly Japan), yet it's somehow also found a few miles away from Sodor...<br />4) The narration says that Diesel is shunting the Jobi wood flatbeds but mysteriously when he gets to the unfinished bridge, he's suddenly coupled to the flatbeds.<br />5) I always appreciate that in the other Thomas tv and movies, they make an effort to show humans coupling the engines or inside them. They are mysteriously absent on Misty Island. The engines magically have fuel and water etc.<br />6) Thomas is encouraged to cross over the shake shake bridge. I don't want my son watching Thomas crossing a bridge that is falling apart and finding Thomas thinks that's ok.<br />7) The zipline and needless cross-rails are just silly.  They're obviously just there (along with the shake shake bridge) to sell toys.<br />8) The movie should have ended when they all arrived on Sodor, but inexplicably Thomas has to go back through the tunnel to now save his three friends and Topham Hatt who went to Misty Island to rescue Thomas.<br />9) Thomas gets from his adrift raft directly onto rails when landing on Misty Island. Er...<br />10)In the newer Thomas series, when someone says something to goad other engines into doing bad things, they repent and say sorry. In this, Thomas' comments about Topham Hatt surely meaning only steamies could be really useful cause Diesel to do something really stupid.  Thomas never has to apologize but Diesel does.<br />11) Come to think of it, the whole thing starts out badly when Harold brings an injured climber on a stretcher to the rescue center building site saying he's saved.  But it's just a construction site - the center is barely even framed.<br /><br />Sure, this is an animated show, but why such a departure from reality and good sense?  Why leave parents having to explain these strange things?  In a later TV episode, Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand show Thomas how to catch the Jobi wood that Wheezy throws. They go to a certain spot and the thrown logs magically stack on their flatbeds.  Where is the Thomas I like letting my son watch?  If you're going to add new engines, why not make them interesting and meaningful?  It's just so disappointing and didn't have to be.<br /><br />Again, my 3 year old loves it and re-enacts scenes from the movie with his Thomas set. But I would rather play Thomas TV episodes for him and not this silly, "what on earth were they thinking?" story.
As a parent I very much enjoy watching Thomas shows and movies.  I rather like trains and Thomas is the standard for child train movies.  However this movie is a dramatic deviation and has a thoughtless story line decorated with absurdity.  In short, Thomas accidentally drifts off to a island five miles directly offshore of Brendam docks.  Despite the FIVE MILE undersea train tunnel linking Sodor to Misty island and the close proximity to shore, none have seen Misty island. Thomas meets new trains on misty island (Dash, Bash and Ferdinand)who were sent to exile on the island for being not really useful and together they work hard to exploit an endangered tree to build a rescue station. Everything works out in the end but they waste valuable story time by logistical reasons of finding some of the people who were out finding Thomas before he rescued himself (if that makes sense).  It should have at least made sense to the writers that this was a horrible story.<br /><br />Also, introduced in this story is the Captain (a boat) who is the only one who has an English accent as all sea-going people have English accents.<br /><br />Finally, Hit entertainment, who puts together Thomas movies, makes getting to the actually movie another logistical challenge by removing function of the "menu" button thus bypassing previews is only achievable through pressing the "skip" button a million times.  I though i was paying for the movie not Hit entertainments free reign of smothering my child with previews of their other products.
This was a wonderful story which kept the kids in suspense and engaged till the last moment.It also had the wonderful ocean scenery and boats which are not part of the usual Thomas and Friends story-line. The kids loved this one... we give it a two-thumbs up!
This show's had its ups and downs over the years, and after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E9HML0">Hero of the Rails</a> provided a recent high point for the show, I was hoping this movie would be enjoyable too. However within minutes of watching I had a feeling my expectations would be let down harshly.<br /><br />Animation's hardly the problem, it all comes back to the script. First, the writers feel the need for the narration to carry on almost constantly, rarely allowing the viewer to simply enjoy the scenery, or to let the story be told through character interaction. Second, there's a focus on rhyming and repetition, which add little to the story but to spell out to the audience what's happening (Thomas repeats, at least FOUR TIMES, a rhyme about how smart and brave he is, right after arranging some ill-conceived plan). There's also little realism - engines cross the ocean on a whim (on one occasion, trailing a steamship *unsecured* on a raft), use *ziplines* to cross gaps, and travel through a tunnel under the ocean with early 1900s technology (a reminder: Thomas' creator Reverend Awdry was a stickler for realistic railway practice, and former showrunners Britt Allcroft and David Mitton tried their best to respect this in the TV adaptation).<br /><br />There's four new characters who contribute next to nothing to the story - Captain the lifeboat has maybe two lines, and the logging engines are repeatedly foolish and rude - which wouldn't be a problem if the story had actually played off those faults. The established characters aren't at their strongest, either. They bluntly explain their emotions, show little common sense, and Thomas is frequently rude, but never called on it. While a secondary character (Whiff) plays a big part for a change, it still feels really rushed and underdeveloped.<br /><br />Overall the movie is poorly-written, difficult to watch, and does little more than show off new toys. Steer clear.
If you are looking to painfully entertain your children while promoting the latest and upcoming Hit Entertainment Thomas and Friends toys for Christmas, then this film is for you!  A true waste of time for anyone looking to share moral and ethics lessons with their favorite blue engine.  The story is as deep as a mud puddle.  I'd go as far to say it not only insults the Awdry/Thomas legacy, but our kids intelligence as well!<br /><br />Hero of the Rails was bad enough, but Hit has slumped to a new Low with this pitiful outing.  It makes me glad I spent so much years back on Thomas DVD's for our first round of kids, now the little ones can enjoy the "better" stories of Sodor, and this garbage can be forgotten on the shelf.<br /><br />The one star is for Ferdinand, the 3-Truck Climax locomotive, one of our favorite prototypes.<br /><br />Pass on this DVD, you'll be glad you did-for the kids sake...<br /><br />and while I have you.<br /><br />Who comes up with these titles? New Thomas Christmas film-Thomas & Friends: Merry Winter Wish....Have you ever wished someone "Merry Winter"?  the audacity.
I don't know how to explain it, but my children LOVE this movie.  Maybe it's that Thomas is so obviously steaming in the wrong direction, making mistakes and being prideful, but it works on a level that gets through to kids.<br /><br />My son got the movie and wooden Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand as a birthday present.  The whole family has watched it.<br /><br />Torture for adults to watch, but the little ones LOVE it.
I think video reviews are purely subjective to the viewers (this one in particular applies to my 2-year-old son and myself) so everyone will have their own opinions whether or not the movie delivers proper messaging or morale or deemed educational. In my opinion movies are made purely for entertainment purposes, and I think that's what this Thomas movie accomplished. I don't expect a movie to necessarily teach my son anything, because that is my job as the parent! But it did what I expected it to do - entertain my 2-year-old for 50 straight minutes without a bother while mom gets her work done around the house! Interestingly enough, the TV series episodes can never keep my son grounded, he was always more interested in just the music videos and the theme song. But this movie kept his attention from even the previews (which I will admit, it is a bit annoying to have to skip through manually without the option to jump right to the main menu) all the way until about the last 15 minutes of the movie. I can replay this movie over and over throughout the day and the next day and he will literally sit there quietly on the couch and watch the thing! That's pretty impressive for my rambunctious toddler at this age!!<br /><br />The CG animation is beautifully done with lots of bright colors (which I think is part of the reason why it catches my son's attention), and the the main theme song is very catchy. The story line itself is pretty good even I find it entertaining. The movie does portray Bash, Dash and Ferdinand as annoying and seemingly unfriendly characters (at first) which isn't necessarily discouraging, because we all know there are tons of annoying little kids on the playground in real life. But those are simply personalities, and Thomas found a way to befriend them and visa versa especially when faced with a challenge that requires them to work together. I think the story does do a great job demonstrating teamwork and problem-solving - two critical real-life skill sets for kids to learn. I personally really didn't find anything that was offensive or any negative messaging as some other reviewers have said...but again that's just my own personal opinion.<br /><br />Bottom line is this was by far the best investment I ever made on entertainment for my son, and I just purchased "Hero of the Rails" and "Day of the Diesels" on Amazon. I'm hoping those 2 other movies will perform miracles like this one...I would be in heaven if he can sit still for 3 whole hours, it's every work-at-home mother's dream come true!
My kids love Thomas movies. They especially love the animated ones. Although Misty Island Rescue has a few plot problems, the boys don't care. I liked the film because Percy, the shy engine, has a bigger role in this one. He also shows us that he can be really brave to help his best friend Thomas.
Gave this to our nephew on Christmas morning and put it on while we had brunch. He loved it! The picture quality on the BR looked great. It also came with a DVD so one copy can go in his portable player and one can stay at Grandma's house. He loves trains so it was the perfect gift for him.
My little guy likes this movie. (I wasnt too impressed though. I guess I like the old school Thomas episodes). He loves ANYTHING thomas. He loves the shakey shakey bridge and logging locos :)<br />This movie is great if your kids are already familiar with the engines as it doesnt really show much about the characters of each one.
My boys (3 & 5) have watched this DVD twice since we got it this afternoon.  They have been talking about it for months and have been waiting for this day with great anticipation.  They were not disappointed.  I have not watched it but I am not sure if the previous reviewers were writing on behalf of a toddler or if they were writing an adult's opinion of the movie.  I can't imagine a toddler boy no loving this movie just as much as any of the other Thomas movies.
While I like the new computer generated animation, I'm disappointed that the story was much more intense than most Thomas adventures.  The scene where Diesel almost falls off a bridge had my 3-year-old son in tears.  That's not at all what I expect when I pop in a Thomas movie.  Parents be warned.
There is a certain magic about the classic Thomas the Tank Engine shows that made it as widely popular as it was. This new rendition doesn't have any of it. This Thomas & Friends release, as well as a number of other recent releases, completely lost the concept that made the originals so great. All you are left with is another derivative and uninspired children's disk you hope will distract the youngsters long enough for you get some work done.<br /><br />So what made the original Thomas great? It's simple really. The show brought the hobbyist model trains to life. Thomas the Tank Engine would showcase what are essentially great big model train sets with all the wondrous detail on landscapes and buildings all done in miniature. This sort of thing spurs the imagination and builds a love of the model train hobby for further generations. It's this simple charm that comes from building a show based on practical effects that you can put together at home that makes the show special.<br /><br />All that is wiped from the table once you start creating the landscapes and characters on computer, which is exactly what this movie is. Thomas and friends are computer generated train engines with moving faces instead of the models with just the eyes moving. The sets, motion scenes, everything is computer generated. What makes this show any different from all of the other CGI animated shows out there? Now you lose what made Thomas great and are playing catch up to shows that have already proven their worth in the computer animated medium. The end results are boring and lackluster when compared.<br /><br />I know I am putting a lot of hate on this show based on it not using traditional models like the original series, but as I said before that's the charm and wonder the original brought forth. Don't take my word for it. My son loves Thomas, but was utterly bored with this movie. I had to flip on NickJr to get his spirits up. If you don't think the absence of real models would make a difference for your kid then at least try it out as a rental before you commit.
In the first 10 minutes or so, there is a scary scene where Diesel is about to fall into the water because the track is broken. My 3-year old screamed for me to turn it off, which I finally talked him into seeing the rest by assuring him that Thomas would save the day (which he did). Anyway, this is a pretty long and scary scene for the 2-3 year olds, so be aware and set expectations early.<br /><br />I could not agree more with the previous reviewer that the new characters are quite annoying ("That's right"). They don't add much to the story other than proving that Thomas isn't always right (they run on oil, which Thomas isn't familiar with).<br /><br />I actually bought this movie because 1) my son loves Thomas 2) it was advertised on YouTube 3) the song is catchy and enjoyable, but it isn't played until the credits roll at the end.<br /><br />I do love that they have taken the old Thomas TV shows and made the trains' faces and the people animated now. This movie does include this upgraded feature, which is a plus.<br /><br />However, my 3-year old has not wanted to watch the movie again, which is disappointing since I paid to own the DVD instead of just renting it for 1 viewing.
We will gladly be adding this new movie to our Thomas Collection. We rented it yesterday on its release date and the boys (aged 2 and 4) love it. We will be buying it this weekend.  Reviews from an adult perspective are great if your sitting down with a group of adults to watch it ;) but seriously... If your with a child who loves Thomas they will likely love this movie. Noted in previous reviews about to much rhyming leave me laughing and wonder if they have seen any other Thomas movies or shows. Because they would know this is nothing new. I will say it is different for typical Thomas but refreshing.... considering as many mothers know we will sometimes watch these over and over with our children and something new is greatly appreciated.  Imaginative play from both my boys were in high gear AFTER the movie and we played "Misty Island" for over an hour with trains and tracks. Very fun and look forward to owning our own copy.
Misty Island Rescue is terrible.  It's amazing how absurd this series has become since the UK days, and this is the worst of all of it.  The writing is awful, the message is ludicrous, and even my 4-year old is sensitive to the contrived story and nonsensical plot contrivances.  This is basically a 90-minute toy commercial written by people who have never seen a train before, and don't seem to know how they work or what they are for.<br /><br />Roger Corman movies are far more realistic and interesting.  Instead of buying this, get a collection of old episodes before the CGI.
My 2 year old loves all things Thomas! We borrowed Misty Island Rescue from the library and he was upset when it was time to return it. So, we bought it! He asks to watch it all the time!
This DVD got us through a 13 hr road trip with my 2 yr old.  I also had the opportunity to memorize every line...
We first saw this via Netflix and decided to buy the movie and some of the trains for a special suprise for our son. He loves it, and at an hour long, it worked great on the airplane and on the ride to the airport. Be aware - you will have the Misty Island Rescue song stuck in your head for days after viewing. Not really disappointed with anything here, although like all smart producers, the ending leaves you searching for the next movie.
My son LOVES trains.  He lives and breathes trains.  That said, we used this video as a "reward" on his potty training sticker chart. We bought the Golden Book version first and he loved the story so much that I ordered the BR video that night and it arrived in 2 days.  He flipped for the video and has watched it about 20 times.  the quality of the video is amazing.  We have other Thomas videos but none are BR and it looked great.  Some of the characters are not my cup of tea, and I am not a fan of the way the engines sometimes dialogue w/each other (as with other Thomas videos and the TV show), but I knew I what I was buying.  This is a kids movie and is a solid hour of entertainment for my son.  We even put the regular DVD in the car and he never seems to tire of it.  If your child likes Thomas, then I highly recommend it.
We purchased this for our almost-4-year-old, and he loves it! He is very interested in trains, especially those that can talk.
This DVD stopped right in the middle, which was very upsetting to a 4 year old.  It would not forward to restart a little later or anything.  It was done.  I bought him another and threw this one out.  This was my the only disappointing experience we've ever had with an Amazon order.
I don't like most of the older Thomas shorts, but this was really pretty good and my son loved it. I would recommend this movie. Plus it is the new animation.
Our 3 year old boy, already a Thomas and Friends fan, absolutely loves this video. He wanted to watch it over and over again. The music, we think, is the biggest draw for him. But he also loves the story and all the characters. In fact, he's just about got it memorized. He takes his Thomas and Friends trains, re-enacts the movie, and sings the songs from memory. He especially loves it when Daddy joins in and impersonates the Misty Island trains. We highly recommend it.
My son really enjoyed receiving this video as a gift. He went right to the dvd player after opening it and watched it.
My son loves Thomas the tank engine.  When we were on vacation in Montana (middle of nowhere) he fell in love with this movie at his cousin's house.  I decided to order it for him to watch in the truck on the way home.  I ordered it 3 days before we were to leave and had it two days before we left.  Amazon Prime shipping is FANTASTIC!  He still watches this movie at least twice per week.
I bought this for my 2 year old son. He is a Thomas fanatic!!  He loves it,he will watch it over and over and over. Good graphics,fun story,new characters. This arrived quicker that I expected, in excellent condition. And the best part I didn't have to spend time at the store.
My 3 year old loves this movie- and I do too! The animation is fantastic, and there are some superb emotional moments- like Diesel almost falling into the ocean! =o The Misty Island banjo music is really adorable, and it's residents (Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand) are pretty okay too. As one reviewer mentioned they DO have annoying voices (like all kiddy characters)and lack substantial character development. But I love how they brush off Thomas when he's being... abrasive... as he is known to be. All in all, good story. I do wish Thomas would be reprimanded for egging on Diesel at the beginning but... I digress. 5 stars!
Great move if you have a child that loves thomas and friends. My son has lots of thomas movies but watches this one the most. He will get all his thomas train and play on the floor trying to copy whats going on in the movie. He just loves it. Great buy.
bought this for child and he loves it.  the combo package is the way to go.  can keep one in the portable player and one at home...
My son is a Thomas fan watches this DVD frequently.  The story is captivating ...even I ended up liking the movie.  I'm glad I got it!
My son loves the movie, I love how fast we recieved the movie & it was in Great Shape!  THANK YOU!
My 3 year old son LOVES this movie, so it gets a raving endorsement. He now imitates Ferdinand's "That's Right" and can recite Thomas' mantra, "I make good decisions, that's what I'm told. I will not be fearful. I'll be brave and bold"
My son LOVES Thomas.  So much so that he gets very excited whenever there is a new one coming out.  He loves the fact that the faces actually move and talk now.  The Blue Ray arrived right on time and in excellent condition.  I will use the vendor again in the future.
This DVD is ok. I agree with the other shoppers that Hero of the Rails was much better. The only thing that I liked about this one is that its a full lenght movie, better for car long rides that the shorter episodes DVDs.
my son loves this movie and his parents did as well. i highly recommend for any kid that loves thomas the train.
Our boys love this DVD and watch it constantly.  Would highly recommend getting the Misty Island Rescue Play-n-Go playset from Fisher Price.
Very good movie, it holds my 2-year old sons attention fairly well.  He calls it the "helicopter movie."  Good addition to your Thomas collection!
I purchased the dvd as a prelude to the Misty Island train set.  He loved the movie and he was extremely excited on Christmas morning to get the train set.
This is a great movie.  My son loves Thomas and Friends. He loved this movie so much that we purchased it for a friend of his for Christmas.
I have several Grandchildren and they LOVED this from start to finish, age 2 to 7. They have looked at it over and over.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O85VYU">Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue</a>
My Grandson LOVED this movie. He watches it all the time and now wants the Misty Island train set to go along with it.
Bought this for my Great Grandson and he loves watching it, he has a lot of fun out of Thomas Items, this is a Great Product, Great Seller......
My 4 and 2 year old boys love the Thomas movies.  Not much else to be said about this I don't want to ruin the story for you and if you have more than one Thomas movie you know how much they like them
Available as a single DVD or as a Blu-ray with DVD combo pack, Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue is an all-new, computer-animated movie for young people, featuring the beloved Thomas the Tank Engine. As Thomas helps to build the new Sodor Search and Rescue Center, a mishap at sea brings him to Misty Island, where he discovers new friends in Bash, Dash and Ferdinand. The three of them try to help Thomas find his way home, while Sir Topham Hatt mounts a search party for the missing yet loyal tank engine. Bonus features include "The Search for Thomas" game, and two karaoke music videos. Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue is a delightfully entertaining adventure, and an excellent gift for young viewers. 58 minutes, closed-captioned, widescreen.
Excellent addition to the Thomas Series!  My son loved the action and adventure that this movie portrayed.  Sir Topham Hat even did a little dance!  So if you have a Thomas lover in your family this is a great purchase.
My 2.5 year old son loves EVERYTHING Thomas. When he'd watch his DVDs in the car and the Misty Island preview would play, he would get excited.  So when this DVD arrived in the mail a big smile was plastered on his face!  I immediately played the DVD and he was glued to the couch straight through.  My wife and I were watching him and during the more suspenseful scenes we could see the emotion in our son's face. SUPER CUTE!  He was just as worried for Thomas as was Sir Topham Hat.<br />Great buy... and Amazon even refunded me $2.00 because the price went down prior to shipping.  Thanks Amazon!
I really hope the people in charge of making Thomas read these reviews.<br /><br />My 3 yr old fell in love with this show over a year ago.  Even he prefers the old model "live action" version.  The computerized crap has lost the magic it used to have.  BRING BACK THE OLD THOMAS!!!
My son loved this movies, watch and watch...again, again.<br />And I think this movies are good for kids. Nice movies.
My three year old son was WAITING for this to be released!  It was very hyped up, and it was a great movie.
for my grandson who is 2 1/2 because "Thomas" and everything on Sodor, is what he's all about right now.<br />So I can't really comment on Misty Island Rescue at the moment. I am positive that it will be popped into his DVD player upon opening it Christmas morning. Yes, he can fully operate the player all by himself.
This was purchased for my 4 year old son. He has watched it several times and I watched it with him. We both enjoyed this DVD and can't wait for more to be released.
I have to agree with many of the reviewers that this Thomas movie was very disappointing.  The four new characters are extremely flat with no endearing qualities, and even Thomas was at times extremely rude and unlikable. The story telling was poor with too many cut scenes, unrealistic snenarios (an old, wooden, underwater tunnel between Sodor and Misty Island? That hasn't collapsed under the water? Really?) and annoying dialogue.<br /><br />I've also seen a few reviewers remark favorably about the music, when it's actually just a rip-off of the theme from Disney's "Pirates of the Carribean." Listen closely to the opening credits. It's changed slightly, probably in hopes that no one would notice.  Is that even legal?  It's just another example of how unoriginal this entire movie was.<br /><br />On the other hand... I have to admit that my 3 year old (soon to be 4) daughter loves anything Thomas, including this movie.  She laughs at the new engines while I'm cringing, and she enjoys the ending when all the engines are reunited.  And she sings and dances with the singalong "Misty Island Rescue."  This is the only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars instead of just 1.  My advice to parents: Pass on this one and buy "Hero of the Rails," which is truly heartwarming and closer to the orignal Thomas.  If your curiousity gets the better of you like mine did and you have to buy this for your child, look away.  Don't watch it with them because you'll only regret it.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for our Grandchild and couldn't wait to watch it.  Loved it and would recommend it.
This installment of the new Thomas CGI character versions was just OK.<br />Its the storyline and writing that's not great, like they really rushed the script through to capitalize on Hero of the Rails and get extra product out in time for Xmas. Its clear that HIT entertainment is fully and completely out for the buck like Disney, exploiting whatever life is left in this franchise.<br /><br />That's the adult view.  The kids view? My son still loves it and its taken over the #1 spot on the blu ray player. Its all about the characters for him.
Unless you have a "Gamer" computer you will be disappointed.  This game is a RAM sucker and a clocking hog.  Frankly, I don't know who would allow their kids to play on a top off the line box<br /><br />The chapter play has no continuity. It plays like a an old bad movie full of flashbacks and dream sequences so that you never know which way is which.
Our young boys love this movie.  The story-line is entertaining, the animation is much better than I was expecting, and of course it includes everyones favorite Thomas & Friends trains.
I bought this for my grandaughter for her 4th birthday and she loves it.  The first day she watched it 4 times!  She has always loved her brother's Thomas books and played with his train sets as well.  She'd gotten tired of Thomas on tv, so buying this was a gamble.  One that turned out a winner in the end.  I have yet to see the whole story, but it definitely captured my grandaughter's attention and heart!
My grandson loves Thomas the Train. Amazon has the largest selection of DVDs.<br /><br />The DVD arrived in great shape and fast..
