I love this movie. Yes it is definitely a B-movie, but as a B-movie I think it's one of the great ones.<br /><br />It comes from the era when Mad Max and the Road Warrior were all the rage and so has the same "lost in a decaying forbidden zone" kind of feel.<br /><br />After trying to be a serious actor and starring in things like the TV mini-series "Rich Man, Poor Man", Peter Strauss' career obviously stalled, as by 1983 he was reduced to starring in B-grade fare like this. And Molly Ringwald, fresh from "The Facts of Life" and prior to her becoming the 80s teen movie queen, has never been more annoying -- which is just what the script called for her to be: an annoying, whiney early teen. And "Ghostbusters'" Ernie Hudson also shows up to round out our cast of heroes.<br /><br />This movie has everything -- from androids to sea monsters and mad scientists to amazons.<br /><br />The costuming and set design are also well done and imaginative, especially the ultra-cool villain Overdog (played to perfection by Michael Ironside) and his nightmarish death maze.<br /><br />If you're looking for meaningful or "serious" sci-fi you should probably look elsewhere. But if you're looking for some purely mindless entertainment which doesn't take itself too seriously and lets you just turn off your brain, chill out and be transported to another universe, this movie is perfect.<br /><br />A classic slice of 80s space-flavoured cheese!
Yes, that's right: five stars.  It's a five star B movie, and one of my favorites.  My dream is that some day they will figure out a way to release these old 3-D movies on DVD for home viewing.  But whether or not they get it in 3-D, I hope someday to see this on DVD.  &quot;Spacehunter&quot; is a total cheesefest, but brilliant in it's own way.  It's my favorite of all of the &quot;forbidden zone&quot; mutant type movies.  There are all sorts of strange deformed creatures running around that were created by a mad scientist.  The best part is Michael Ironside, who is awesome as the Overdog, who is the head mutant of this particular forbidden zone.  He runs a death maze the he feeds beautiful women into to see if they can survive.  Best line: &quot;I like her.  I like her for the maze!&quot;  Check it out.
This movie freaking rules. When I was a kid it was on every time I was sick home from school, on public TV, at about noon. It was very consistent. I TRUST THIS MOVIE. Buy it. It will always be there for you in times of need and is perfect with soup and kleenex and a couch.
Somehow, this is much more entertaining than it should be. It's one of those films that's dumb but totally watchable. One thing that none of the other reviews has mentioned is the decent score by Elmer Bernstein which adds a lot to the film. The main theme is suitably rousing, a la The Magnificent Seven, but he also has some whistful pipe/flute cues that complement the thematic elements of being on a strange outlying world where civilization has broken down, adding a tinge of sadness to the proceedings. As McNab, Ironside is great as always, and there's just enough invention to offset the obvious genre influences, which, as other people have noted, are actually more on the Mad Max than the Star Wars side of things.
Where do I begin here?  Molly Ringwald plays an urchin of a girl on a planet that is run by an overlord using young women as sex objects even though he himself is part machine.  Sound strange?  Well, it is.<br />Oddly enough, the film is very watchable too largely due to the actors.  Peter Strauss is very handsome here and has a slight Han Solo act going.  He meets up with Molly Ringwald and their relationship is hard to decipher at times.  It seems they always end up sleeping together in silver quilted sleeping bags, her arm draped across him even though he could be her father.<br />Is their relationship romantic or platonic?  Hard to tell here.<br />The special effects are very well done and the scenery beautiful!  There is just enough action and just high enough production and just strange enough situations to keep one interested even though there isn't anything too, too deep here.<br />People searching for a new Star Wars will be disapointed but those who want something sort of offbeat in space will probably like this.
Originally released as an 80's "3-D film" which is why the<br />opening title is so hard to read on conventional TV with<br />all the whizzy meteors flying out, Spacehunter is nonetheless<br />a well made film that does "take you out of your living room".<br /><br />For me, the vehicle designs and the rocky Utah scenary are the<br />best aspects of the film. The production design is brilliant<br />and the acting convincing. The buggies are fantastic!<br /><br />Well worth buying but perhaps more for diehard sci-fi fans. The<br />film is not really suitable for younger viewers even though its<br />marketed at a "Star Wars" audience and has much of that film's<br />character and hardware style.<br /><br />Michael Ironside plays a great villian, a pity we don't get a<br />little more of his charcater's background and how he evolved<br />into a villian.
Space Hunter, was for many years a movie I had on tape and would watch any time I was down with the flu. It was fun and Sci-Fi, and I always felt better when watching it. It had been many years since I had seen it, and last night I rented the download from Video on Demand at Amazon to my TiVo.<br /><br />So here's the deal, it wasn't near as good as I remembered; the FX are a joke by today's standards. Flash light on the air bubbles for stars, etc. It is a cheese covered corn-dog of a film, still fun but not nutritious. But for those who are fans of Sci-Fi video games, I think this is still a fun ride, and really I think the script would be exactly translatable.<br /><br />So if you are in the mood for a low budget `80s "B" movie Sci-fi, this is just  the ticket, if you want great Sci-fi, keep looking.<br /><br />2 ½ * for nostalgia's sake.
This is a good old fashioned adventure, with some comedy and good natured suspense. We remember it from when it was released, but my 8 year old grandaughter loved it - she watched it twice! We are a little disappointed in the quality of the DVD; it does seem quite grainy and not much better picture that the VHS.
I remembered this as being a pretty good film or its genre when it first came out so I took a chance when I found it a good price. I wasn't disappointed, it is pretty silly but lots of fun if you take it for what it is pure science fiction with a second tier class of stars.  Molly Ringwald shows some of the talent that would make here such a success in her teen years.  It isn't Star Wars but it is fun.
The movie has a good story line.  The actors do a great job.  Special effect (for 1983) are good.  I saw this when it came out in theaters.  This was the first movie I watched with Molly Ringwald and became an instant fan.  I am glad I added it to my collection.
Eureka!  I have had a VHS tape of this classic sci-fi movie for a long time.  I've been a sci-fi fan my whole life.  I'm also a long time fan of Peter Strauss.  So how could I not love this movie!!  I was ecstatic when I stumbled over the DVD while going through Amazon recommendations for my profile.  I didn't even have to think twice.  Even though some may considered it a B-movie I love watching it.  I can finally retire my VHS tape!  If you like good clean fun, action and adventure and a bit of sci-fi to boot, you'll enjoy this movie!
Released in 1983 it is indeed in the same arena as Mad Max2, Beyond Thunderdome, Judge Dredd, and Waterworld. All of these entail surviving in destroyed worlds where death, greed, power, and violent domination are the norm.<br /><br />It is a "B" grade movie, no doubt. That is reflected in its choices for casting, loose connections between some scenes, and healthy dose of "hokiness". But being a "B" grade movie doesn't make it bad. Actually, I find it an easy movie to sit back and enjoy. The scenery and sets do a lot for this movie. The apocalyptic flavor will entice any who are into this type of sci-fi. The sets and props, albiet low budget, were visually well crafted and did a lot to make this film. The actors aren't box office giants, although Molly later goes on to do well there. Even so, they have what this film really needed to pull off the reality of the characters, that is they were not so full of themselves to feel this movie was beneath them. They were their characters and played them true. Well..., maybe not the three actresses who were stranded and kidnapped in the beginning.<br /><br />There are many "B" grade movies that have strong followings despite the label "B". I am not sure if this film has any sort of cult following, but it wouldn't surprise me. For me it is a nice movie to get immersed in for a couple of hours with friends or family and not worry about foul language, soft or hard porn, or explicit violence depicted with copius blood and gore. My wife and I saw it at the drive-in in 1983 and I later shared it with our children on VHS. I was pleased to find it on DVD, especially since it has long disappeared from most movie rental shelves.<br /><br />I never share an opinion about movies but as a former FXer from the early 90's, I felt justified having worked for Doug Trumbull and Andy Vanja, and with Joel Hynek, John Gaeta, Kelly Kerby, Diana Walczak, Frank Gallego and many more good people.
This was the first movie I ever saw with Molly Ringwold.  I knew she was something special by this movie.  It's a good movie if you like Science Fiction.
So much cheese and corn you get cheesy popcorn! This movie is a classic though, it makes you laugh the whole way through. What were they thinking when they made this? "It will be the next blocbuster movie since star wars!"Funny stuff worth owning it!
It was basic, but the acting will pass. It still reminds me of a sort of Mad Max type film. Pure 1980's look and feel to it. It's worth renting and watching once if you are a Scifi fan.
I'm not going to bore you with a lot of talk about actors or anything of that nature, because I would probably fail at it.<br /><br />What I will say is, among B-movies, this one is a winner.<br /><br />You have cool characters for the most part, cool vehicles being used.. plenty of battles scenes (although the effects are a bit weak sometimes). Decent acting from the characters.<br /><br />And one scene in particular stands out, as just being comical/natural. Our lead man, gets tired of our stinky companion and shoves her into a large mud hole and scrubs her. I cracked up.<br /><br />Over all its a really good movie.
I first owned this flic on VHS tape when it first came out. I loved it! I played it many times till one of my relatives hi-graded it and destroyed it in his poorly maintained VCR. When I tryed to find another copy I couldn't; so sad. At last, Amazon, and I'm happy again! For fast paced total entertanment that doesn't require much heavy thinking this cant be beat.
Picture a Tough-hard as nails space captain who owes more money than there is in Fort Knox...  Pay every one off, easy-just rescue three hot women from a forbidden world.  Who can he call on for help, a money hungry space-cop, a hot robot bombshell, a junker space ship that's just spare parts flying in formation, and a young survivor girl.  If you enjoy fighting mutants, rescuing damsels in distress and good one liners, here's your movie.
Kind of like "Mad Max" in space. A sci-fi B movie but I find it entertaining. (But then I like Sci Fi B movies)
Ah... the joys of pulp-science fiction. To experience the kind of stories more often found in old comic books come on the big screen can be confusing to some, but not this comic book fan. Spacehunter, along with movies like Star Wars and Flash Gordon, uses a tried and true model reminiscent of the classic Saturday morning serials. In spite of it's B-rated budget and content Spacehunter still comes out a winner.<br /><br />You can see the main influences come from the post apocalyptic genre of movies like The Road Warrior, but the space opera genre is still strong with dastardly villians, brave heroes, damsels in distress, and all that. Add a sprinkle of adventure and you pretty much get the recipe of Spacehunter.<br /><br />In a single word, Spacehunter is fun. The content is light and not thought provoking, but at the same time not overly simplified. You will catch some lame terminologies like 'mega space credits' and some of the spaceships look like they were made from styrofoam, but at least those shortcomings are few. Special effects work well enough and compliment the story instead of detracting from it. The props and technology range from "what?" to "cool". Gun props aren't overdone with odd accessories and the attachments they do use work well with the pace of the movie. I particularly enjoyed that mini missile launcher. Vehicles are kinda neat, and most of them are smart designs. Gotta love Wolfe's Scrambler.<br /><br />The acting from the main characters is what sets this B-movie apart from most. Every one of them gave subtle and believable performances that were a very pleasant difference from most B-list science fictions. Molly Ringwald does a great job in her big screen debut as the lovable yet bratty Nikki. Peter Strauss does the standard Saturday matinee hero with style, and the hero/sidekick chemistry between Strauss and Ringwald was a treat to behold. Like I said, pretty much the entire main cast of characters made the movie as good as it is.<br /><br />The DVD itself pretty much gives you the movie and that's about it. No special features or dynamic dolby audio. Just the movie and some scene selections. So keep that in mind when deciding to drop some coin on owning a copy.<br /><br />I recommend Spacehunter for anybody who wants a good popcorn sci-fi flick that's not too violent or vulgar, but still wrought with low budget entertainment. Keep in mind it was made as a 3-D movie so some takes were made to fly off the screen, but of course won't. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If you're the type of person who can love a movie that's light on serious sci-fi content but chunky on the fun give Spacehunter a shot.
ok,so this isn't the best sci-fi movie ever but it really is fun,if you can get into it. this adventure looks like a cross between "road warrior" and "alien" as it tells the story of a bounty hunter wolfe(peter strauss,tring hard but just not han solo) landing on a planet ravaged by plage to rescue three ladies who crashed there and are being held hostage by the strangest villian ever overdog(michael ironside(looking like a borg and being a grade a ham)! young molly ringwald is on hand as is ernie hudson to help strauss get the girls back.slow in places and some really strange encounters with the planets other citizens make it a mixed bag,but as i said if you can get into the spirit of fun you may find that you like this one also! give it a try!
This is one of my favorite movies.  I watched this way back, and I later bought the tape when the price was $25 and considered it a great value.  I still watch that movie once in a while.  It's high adventure and an all together great movie.
Three years after "Facts of Life," but a year away from her triumphant role in "Sixteen Candles," Molly Ringwald finds herself the prisoner of some tricked-out bum named Overdog on a junk planet that looks like Fred Sanford's backyard.  Peter Strauss, the poor man's Richard Chamberlain, plays the poor man's Han Solo (or Lone Starr, if you prefer) and tries to rescue her.<br /><br />Yes, "Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone" is low-budget fun directed by Lamont Johnson.  According to the IMDb, Johnson once played Tarzan on radio.  With this movie, he shows a keen radio performer's eye for cinema.  Ripping off "Star Wars" and "Road Warrior" and featuring more rickety metal garbage than any four episodes of TLC's "Junkyard Wars," this flick has a spunky little heart but little else to offer.<br /><br />Ringwald would go on to become John Hughes' teen muse and the undisputed 80s teen comedy queen, usually playing upper middle class girls dating sexless, nonthreatening gimps like Andrew McCarthy.  Here, she's a punky little spitfire who needs a bath and a shave.  Come to think of it, she IS the spunky little heart of this movie.  The rest of it can go to hell!  But I kid "Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone."  It's a silly movie with a clumsy title, yet worth watching with friends some drunken evening.  But please- try not to confuse "Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone" with "Metalstorm:  the Destruction of Jared Synn."  They both have colons in their titles, and promise things like "adventures," "destruction" and "Jared Synn."<br /><br />But only "Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone" has Molly Ringwald being tortured by Michael Ironside.  Ask for it by name!
The movie is kind of fun. Not bad for a 'B' movie and not as bad as 'Men In Black' This one I would at least watch again without trying to chew my arm off. (yep you guessed it , I cant say the same for 'MIB')
This is agreat sci-fi movie, anyone who likes the movies more into the "Mad Max" scenerio will love this.  Given the year it was made the special effects are not bad, the plot is simple, lots of action, heroics and almost cheesy hero music.<br /><br />You can't expect a sci-fi flick to be a masterpiece of cinema world, its for entertaiment.  You have 3 maidents with huge 80's hair do's who need rescuing.  We have a lone star hero is in debt and will rescue the maidents for the reward.  Some interfernace from the maniacal evil scientist turned life sucking cyborg.  AND the cuttest chick Molly Ringwald!  Her character actually develops through the movie from an screaming brat to something more serious ( could show more skin though).<br /><br />This movie has the perfect post apocaliptic feel, with kinda William Gibson theme.  You have trains with viking sails, lasers, steam powered plows, spaceships that burry underground, mutants, zombie like creatures, cyborgs, amazons and lots of action.<br /><br />The movie kept me plastered to the screen for the whole movie and I will watch it again and again.  A definate must see/have for anyone who likes science fiction movies.
After not expecting movies like &quot;Krull&quot; on DVD, here comes more good news. &quot;Spacehunter&quot; is coming to DVD on December 4!<br />(Same day as the first Babylon 5 disc)<br />Spacehunter will get the basic Columbia/Tristar DVD treatment:<br />16x9 widescreen and Pan&amp;scan, trailer, cast, crew and production<br />notes, sound format still unknown(I don't know if they released<br />it in a multi-channel format in 1984, but i'm guessing Dolby 4.0 or 4.1,but i'm basing this on another film on DVD from this time<br />&quot;Runaway&quot; with Tom Selleck. At the very least we will get 2.0 mono or 2.0 stereo).<br />Thanks to DVDFile for the heads up!
This movie has a serious pacing problem.  It runs very slow in most of the non-action parts, but runs quickly in the action sequences.  The dialog is terrible.  Give nervous actors non-natural dialog and the whole movie looks more like a bad high school production.  Molly Ringwald character tends to ramble on and on. Midway through, the movie forgets it is in 3D.  One sequence in particular, walking across the desert, goes on and on.<br /><br />I watched Spacehunter in 1983 in the theater.  It was my first 3D movie.  I thought it was a good b-movie at the time.  Viewing the same movie now shows me it had lots of ideas but not much money.  Somehow, the non action sequences go slowly and the characters are just doing exposition instead of reacting to what happens.
