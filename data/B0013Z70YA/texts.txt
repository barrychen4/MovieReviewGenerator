Courageous Avenger, 1935 film<br /><br />The film begins with five riders. A lone man walks in the desert. The riders collect him to work the mine. The "Giant Strike Mine" ships out gold on a wagon (without an armed escort). Those five riders approach, and shots are fired. Dick falls off the wagon. Those men open two heavy boxes of gold. Kirk Baxter will be sent to investigate. Those robbers use silver bullets. The firing pin left a clue on the cap of the shells. (Latest ballistics tests.) Kirk arrives in time to help Beth, and offers help to Mr. Carson. Can they hide the gold in an ordinary shipment? Beth can stay with Kirk's aunt. We see how hard the captive silver miners work! (No union.) A message tells Gorman about a "heavy shipment". The robbers kill the wagon driver and abduct Beth. Can Kirk trail Beth? Can Carson be trusted? Mr. Davis thinks so. Kirk goes into town.<br /><br />Carson retrieves the pigeons. Kirk finds that man hiding in the rocks and disarms him. There is a fight, Kirk wins. The horse returns to his stable. "Johnson" asks for refuge from Gorman. Carson finds Wilford. Pigeons carry messages in the desert. One man plans an escape. A new message tells about Baxter and another gold shipment. Can Baxter escape now? He takes Beth as well, she will warn the sheriff. Baxter catches up to the wagon and warns Davis. There is a trick. Kirk captures most of the gang and drops them for the sheriff's men. Can Gorman escape? Not from Kirk. There will be a happy ending for Beth and Kirk: marriage and a good job.<br /><br />This is an average story about saving a small business from gangsters who have an inside man. You wonder how the gang would buy provisions in a small town without anyone becoming curious. Johnny Mack Brown was a star football player for the University of Alabama who made a career in movies.
