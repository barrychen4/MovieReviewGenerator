This is part of a series of 'geographical' blues lessons by John Miller.  This review covers them all.<br /><br />John Miller is a gifted instructor.  Many artists are gifted players, but they do not all possess the gift of teaching.<br /><br />John Miller's teaching is a slow, methodical breakdown with anticipation of student struggles.  His demeanor is humble, quiet, respectful, and enthusiastic for the music.  With judicious use of the pause button, it is as close as a student can come to face to face lessons with a master.<br /><br />The series highlights some of the lesser known blues songs of regional greats from long ago.  The songs are wonderful to learn to sing, but for me, they are, almost to a song, terrific for acoustic solo playing.  Each region has its specifics but they are perfectly suited for instruction to the Intermediate guitarist (late beginners should collect John's DVDs) as well as the Advanced guitarists who need to learn new songs.<br /><br />Each geographical region has its unique songs, and John's teaching is consistent throughout.  "Texas Blues" is currently my favorite, but this changes as I go from DVD to DVD.<br /><br />Jackson Blues, Texas Blues, Memphis Blues,  Atlanta Blues as well as Theory and Chord instruction DVDs are all 'must haves' for those who learn from DVD lessons.
Again John Miller has delivered. One has the impression, that Miller though his respect and love for the American Country Blues is absolute, that it it is all a bit of a pleasant sideshow to him. He is a master and exponent of so much more than just country blues - and of course he is being aware of and listenting to his excellent recordings over many years in other styles. As always, Miller's musical taste is exquisite: always a real artist's nouse for the exquisite subtle sounds and melodies of more obscure artists, that are not always obvious to ordinary musicians and listeners. Miller above all instructers appreciates the value of timing and counting when instructing and though it is not always necessary, it is most valuable when the ear is not always enough to negotiate passages. John Miller's humility of person, intelligence of instruction and mastery of instrument are the real thing.
