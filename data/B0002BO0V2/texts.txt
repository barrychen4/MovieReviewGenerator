Bob Hope was essentially the official Presidential comedian for generations - and this DVD is a great look back at his good-spirited ribbing of many administrations.  It shows how political humor can be funny without being devisive.
DVD was delivered on time and in excellent condition.  From a historical perspective, this would be a good addition to one's DVD library for insight to Bob Hope and his personal relationships with the many Presidents of the United States outside of official business.
The DVD was for my daughter and she loved it, she is a history buff so this was really fun to watch.
