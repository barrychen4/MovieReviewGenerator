This was simply the best documentary I have seen on this topic.  It ties all the prophets of old together.  It talks about all the major prophets in the three Abrahamic Faiths.  One of my favorite prophets, Zoroaster or Zarathustra is mentioned.  I found it to be inspirational.  It is definitely worth the price.  I recommend it...
