I was fortunate enough to catch this film at the New York City International Film Festival in August and WOW! The acting is incredible - both Alexia Rasmussen & Kent Moran deliver powerful performances and Cybill Shepherd plays one of the most memorable roles of her career. The film is beautiful made, with scenic shots of New York City and Greenwhich, CT, and a musical score that is up there with two of my personal favorites, Good Will Hunting & Garden State. This is a great film, that pulls you in from the start and never lets go. This is one certainly worth watching again & again! I give it my highest recommendation.
When i first watched this film,  i had no idea what to expect. but i was pleasantly surprised on how well of a put together  heartfelt story it was. the leads did a great job in their parts and the other cast were great also that rounded it out.cybil shines in  her role and it's the  best i've seen her do in quite sometime.  this is  tearjeaker keep those tissues handy<br /><br />Highly Recommended film for lovers of tender love stories and overcoming  challenges in life.<br /><br />it's NR - Not Rated , but it does have some sesuality in a scene and drinking, but a clean flick none the less. i don't think they're any language in it.did'nt hear any.
this was a random movie I picked out on Netflix to watch and I am so glad I did.  I laughed, I cried, I know it sounds cliche, but what an amazing love story.  Such a great message.
I cannot say enough good things about the beautifully written story and the wonderful compositions from writer/actor/composer/producer Kent Moran, but gifted and talented would be 2.<br /><br />This movie is an incredibly woven tale of friendship and love and the wonderful way that music can be felt, not just heard, from our hearts, no matter if we do not even have the ability to hear it with our ears.<br /><br />The plot develops with a story of a young man who lost his mom.  We are not initially then told the specific type of this particularly terminal illness, only that he nursed her til her through as she fought a five-year long battle with cancer.<br /><br />We fall in love with this gentle, heartwarming, positive, compassionate soul who's life was changed by a woman who endured so much and remained so grateful for life each day she struggled. He works with his best bud as a waiter at a cafe  and saves every dime he can spare for recording equipment to record his first demo.  He dreams big and works hard at his job to save for his dream, but he does more, he inspires others by his presence, his positivity and his sheer and utter determination to follow his goal of making music that would last forever in people's hearts.<br /><br />Yes, ***spoiler alert***the ending is definitely a tearjerker but the whole story put together is one of the few stories that changes you, makes you think and appreciate the little things more after watching it. This movie is truly art and I look forward to Mr. Moran's deeper foray into the music world also one day, he has talent and gift that should be shared.
So I watched this for the first time on netflix on a Sunday when i had nothing else to do. Didn't see myself crying multiple times within the next two hours...but it happened haha. Amazing acting all around, I felt like every character hit the mark just right. Kent Moran who wrote, produced, and acted in this movie is definitely an up and coming star. Not to mention his musical abilities. Definitely a must see movie if you enjoy moving love stories.
This film FAR exceded my expectations. It takes you on an amazing emotional journey from start to finish. An excellent production and definitely a love story that youll remember! Great soundtrack too!
I caught this movie today on LMN, when I was channel surfing.  Unfortunately I missed the first 25 minutes.  I tried not to let Kent Moran distract me from the plot, but he's gorgeous.  He's a screenwriter, musician and actor huh?  Not just a pretty face.  Anyways, back to the movie...  It was a movie about real people, that I could relate to.  I'm buying this so I can see what I missed.
Great movie filmed in New York, directed by Matt Thompson and written by Kent Moran. Scenes were filmed with the 'Red Cam' so it feels like you're right there with the actors. It's a great story about a high society deaf girl (controlled by her mother) and an ordinary 'Joe' (who works for a living) who fall in love. His dream is music and so is hers, even though she can't hear. Make sure to have your tissue ready for it will tug at your heart and the tears will come.<br />It has won many awards in the film festivals throughout the US, one which was 'Best Director' at the Beverly Hills Film Festival.<br />It's another Love Story movie worth watching.
Few films these days are truly inspired and challenge the viewer to become a better person for having watched the film. This is a rare gem that does just that. This film is crammed full of emotion and heart. It is absolutely a testament to the fact that love, generosity, selflessness, having an appreciation for life and caring for each person we meet will make this world a better place. This film will challenge you to take life and your dreams to the next level. ...And keep those tissues nearby. With this much emotion packed in, you'll definitely need them.
A well done picture with gifted actors.  The director, Matt Thompson, was able to get the most from his cast.  A touching story which pulls on the heart strings.  I anticipated the ending but a part of me hoped that it would not end that way.  The romantic in me wanted it to be otherwise.
Listen to Your Heart is a modern day Romeo and Juliet love story with a huge twist. You will enjoy watching the relationships of the characters develop as they overcome life's harsh realities. The music and scenery are breathtaking. A heart-wrenching film!
I absolutely LOVED this film. A friend and I went to see it at the New York City International Film Festival and we were blown away. This film will tug at your "heart" strings. It really is watching a beautiful journey between extraordinary characters. I cannot wait to get my hands on a copy.
"Listen To Your Heart" is a heart warming, emotional story for all young teens as well as the young at heart. It expresses everything from parental overbearingness to Deaf culture.  This is a great teaching aid for Deaf  awarenes, peer pressure, self respect,true friendship and real love.  Simply phenomal.  Make sure you have a large box of kleenex.
Love this movie!<br />1.) Emotion...The movie has some characters you will love and cheer for, and some you will hate.<br />2.) Twists....The movie has a couple of turns that are unpredictable for sure. Without giving them away, this isn't a movie that just starts, tells one plain story, and ends.<br />3.) Great acting/powerful...You get the feeling that you're watching a real life story play out.<br /><br />One of my favorite movies, and when I started watching it, I didn't even think I'd like it. Give it a try!
For me as well, this was a random movie choice on Netflix. I can honestly say this is now in my top 5 favorite movies! I went through just about every emotion possible while watching this movie. The leads are amazing! It starts out a little slow, but it doesn't take long for the actors and the story line to just suck you in. It is an incredibly heartfelt movie and love story with a great message! I would highly recommend this movie to everyone! It's inspirational. And I will be buying it.
What a wonderful movie. Eye opening would be another word to describe this movie. I have a son that is deaf and I could definatly relate to this. I think anyone who has a child or knows any one that is deaf should see this movie.
The kind of love that everyone should experience at least once but most never do...<br /><br />A must see film.
****MAJOR SPOILER****DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW****<br /><br />Before I invested time watching this, I wish I had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end.  I wouldn't have bothered, it wasn't that good anyway.  Maybe this review will save someone.  Giving it 2 stars because I've seen abyssal films that only deserve 1-star, and this is not that bad.
This film was just awful, and I decided not to waste my time finishing it.  Everything about it was bad, from start to finish-  at least to the finish line that I chose.  A real stinkeroo.
If the producers knew anything about Deaf Culure they would have picked an actual deaf actress to play the role. It is not only offensive but is not even remotely realistic in showing what deafness and deaf culture is like. It only shows a helpless deaf girl who magically hears after getting a cochlear implant. Come on. It takes 3 months to heal after the surgery and even get the thing turned on and then years of speech therapy etc for it to be successful, IF its even successful. The actor was cute, I'll give them that much but isn't it time to let the Deaf act for themselves.
I loved the movie because it was very decent. In a day when you cannot watch a movie, even a romantic film without there being indecency it was pretty decent. I loved the movie because Danny was very selfless in his love for Sam and they were very committed to one another. I loved that he was very respectful towards her and that he lived life to the fullest. He did not take anything for granted and he never complained. He was very grateful for what he had. And the world was a better place because of him. He influenced so many people- even his boss quit drinking and he was an inspiration. He taught Sam to be independent and to grow up which she needed to do. Her mother was very controlling, maybe as a result of overcompensating for the loss of Sam's dad. But it was not a healthy love. The way Danny loved Sam allowed her to become all that she could be and to live to her fullest potential. It even reminded me of how Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it so that we can become all that we can be.
I started a new college degree plan with ASL(American Sign Language). I originally saw this movie on Lifetime movie network. I loved it on there, so I wanted the dvd, so I could watch it whenever I wanted to, and now I've seen about 4 times since I got the dvd.
Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap. As in a Festival of Crap. As in craptacular. As in a movie that would make Plan Nine From Outer Space look like Fellini and Dunston Checks In look like Woody Allen's finest creations. I personally cannot imagine how anyone with the IQ of a rhesus monkey would give this movie two stars, let alone five. I'm guessing that the cast members desperately e-mailed their moms and begged them to write bogus reviews on Amazone. Either that or an army of zombie reviewers, the clones of Rex Reed, are out there on the loose, writing wildly enthusiastic reviews of anything that was shot even remotely in focus.<br /><br />I mean, if someone ever told me they liked this movie, I would immediately begin looking for their lobotomy scars. Shall I number just a few of the reasons? 1) Miserable, whiny music throughout the entire abomination that makes the Free Credit Report Dot Com band sound like the freaking Beatles and Rolling Stones all rolled into one. 2) Terrible plot with too many twists and turns--and yet completely and utterly predictable at the same time. 3) Cardboard characters, with Cybil Shepard playing a crazed mother, probably channeling her on-screen rage by thinking of her agent and wondering how she was roped into this woofer. 4) Possibly the worst dialog I've ever heard in a movie. Honestly, I've seen third grade Christmas pageants with better lines.<br /><br />My God. I cannot believe I watched this craptacular thing, and am seriously considering divorcing my wife for choosing this on Netflix, no matter how many times she apologizes to me. Mind you, I NEVER write movie reviews on Amazon, let alone dish the dirt on ones this bad. But I feel I have a duty to humanity and to you, my fellow movie enthusiast. Listen To Your Heart will be 100 minutes of your life that you'll never get back again, precious time that will be better spent watching another movie, helping the poor, mowing your grass, rearranging your sock drawer, or even downloading midget porn for your later satisfaction. Anything but this. You'll thank me. Trust me on this.
I saw this movie on life time and agree with other reviewers that it is one of the most decent love stories except for the daughter giving the mother the finger and teaching her how to drink but that's pretty clean for Hollywood these days. It does have a anti-parent feel to it that wants to make you believe you  can do better without them but let me warn you about getting your messages about life from Hollywood you can  only go as high as humans can go in their presentation. Just human love, sucess, and music is not enough to live by especially when facing death you certainly need something higher than yourself in both cases. Besides that the movie does give you a better understanding of what it means to be deaf both the good and bad situations it carries with it
The cliche's:<br /><br />1. The supportive wise black friend,<br />2. The overbearing to the point of unbelievable mother<br />3. The hero is perfect, has higher ideals than Jesus<br />4. When he goes into convulsions on the floor, I thought, here we go, he's dying of cancer, sure nuff<br /><br />Worst movie I've seen in a while, then again, I'm not female, nor under the age of 16.
This movie had enough drama for two different movies.  For that matter, it should have been two different movies and I would have probably liked it better that way.  The first act has to do with the drama between the girl and her mother - the second part - well, I won't be a spoiler, but it changes direction radically in the second act and goes over the top.  It wasn't a waste of time, but I thought it could have been a lot better.  P.S.  I strongly suspect that the positive reviews for this movie were ballot-stuffed by the filmmakers.
There is handicap and deadly disease, poverty, alcoholism, loss of a parents during childhood and super abusive mother. All that topped off with great love and forgiveness. Little bit overdone even for my (romantic) taste.
The synopsis for this film was so intriguing I had to rent it.<br /><br />After watching it, I can't decide which was worse - the writing or the acting.  I'm going to have to go for the writing, since clever and creative writing very, often saves shoddy acting abilities.  Oh wait, there was also painful musical numbers.  Wow, this is a tough one.  I'll stick with the writing.<br /><br />What could have been a very interesting premise, was shot down by glib, cliche, canned and mediocre dialogue.  It started out with a glimmer of hope and quickly sank in a pool of woes.  Think of it as a one hour and forty minute cross section of a really bad soap opera, then throw in some really bad music and singing and that about covers it.<br /><br />Poor, yet heroic waiter with aspirations of being a song writer meets beautiful, rich deaf girl with a monster, control freak mother who doesn't want them to see each other.  Once that turmoil is resolved then one of the characters instantly comes down with a terminal illness with all the typical scenes that go along with that. No, I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Best to say it's a mix of "Fame" within the setting of "The Days of Our Lives" and an ending laced with  "A Walk to Remember," without the eloquence, depth or talent of either.  If I could take back my rental fee I would.  AND they are trying to recommend the musical CD that goes along with this film!  That would also have to be a NO.<br /><br />Next......
I've lost all faith in reviews. I'm one of the most generous star-givers out there, and I could not find anything good about this movie. I chose it based on reviews, but I just can't believe that anyone, let alone a majority, could give this 5 stars.  Beware of this one unless you like sappy, poorly acted, unrealistic films, with really bad music.  I hung in there until the end waiting for it to get better, but it just kept nose-diving deeper and deeper.
