AWESOME documentary on the 1/7th Cav main battle in Vietnam.. highly recommend it.
This series, presented by Walter 'most trusted man in America' Cronkite is good for anyone one wanting to view an unbiased account of the Vietnam war. There is no Barber's Adagio over the footage, no critical narration - it lets the footage and facts speak for itself - boo-koo information as a VET would say.
This was a brief and very telling anecdote to the later "feel good" film, We Were Soldiers" of the same battle, the Ia Drang Valley battle of Nov 14-18 1965. This brief documentary includes reminiscences of participants including Colonel Moore of the First of the 7th Air Cav, and Colonel Anh of the NVA and his superior officer, who were in command of the battle. It is far more honest in its representation which includes memory of the haymaker ambush by the NVA after the main battle was over (the Americans thought). The battle was highly significant since General Westmoreland chose to ignore the disastrous ambush and take his lesson from the main battle, which the US "won" in terms that had little application in Vietnam, and also Secretary of Defense Macnamara may have concluded, based on this battle, that the war was unwinnable in any terms the American people would accept, yet kept his counsel for three more years. The Hollywood film, we were soldiers, based on Col. Moore's study of the battle, was dishonest and a disservice to Colonel Moore and all the brave soldiers on both sides who fought this battle. It came out just in the wake of 9/11 and as we were gearing up for Iraq and may have fed the need for Americans to feel good about themselves, but it was an historical atrocity which this earlier documentary repairs.<br /><br />Charles Bland Niagara Falls NY
