How can anyone purchase a movie titled "2 Headed Shark Attack" that stars Carmen Electra and Brook Hogan and review it negatively? Seriously, what were you expecting????<br /> Things go wrong quickly for a group of students on a Semester At Sea trip, when their boat, the Sea King hits a shark, damaging the boat. The boat begins to take on water and the group heads for safety on a nearby atoll and are terrorized and devoured by the double headed beast.<br /> Is the acting bad? Yep<br /> Is the dialogue wretched? Uh Huh<br /> Is the shark CG and cheesy looking? Sure Is<br /> Is this movie totally fun? Absolutely
"2-Headed Shark Attack" is the latest ridiculous sea monster flick from The Asylum. Before you can even get to the film there's an intro from The Asylum bragging how they have done over 100 of these cheesy disaster films so far, and the beauty is that if you've seen one you pretty much know what's going to happen in any of the others: just substitute "two-headed shark" for "giant alligator," "enormous squid," or "subterranean volcano under a metropolis" and you've got it. As the credits unwind to obnoxious college students on a speedboat, creature feature fans may feel the hairs on the back of their neck stand up when they see the director is Christopher Douglas-Olen Ray. With B-movie genetics like this you know it's going to be an entertaining movie for all the wrong reasons. Not that I fault Chris Ray, it's not like anyone was going to make a good movie called "2-Headed Shark Attack" or anything. You know what you're buying when you see the title.<br /><br />The opening starts the production off right. Two talented water skiers in bikinis are pulled behind a boat towed by three ogling guys taking their pictures. I therefore found it a bit incredulous that nobody in the boat noticed when a giant two-headed shark leapt from the water and neatly munched them down. Not that it matters. The real meat of the story, the chum as it were, starts when we meet Professor Babbish (Charlie O'Connell) who is taking his class of insufferable students on a "semester at sea" to learn...well, something. It starts off with a lesson in sextant use, but quickly turns to a sunbathing demonstration. They are on a typical Florida tourist boat...no I'm sorry, a "US education vessel," the "Sea King," sailing "hundreds of miles from anywhere" and immediately sustain shark damage via a curious scene that you may not find entirely plausible. In the process the shark damages their radio antenna (ponder) and they cannot communicate with anyone. The interesting point is that bonehead jock Cole (Geoff Ward) was scolded to turn his cell phone off not more than five minutes earlier. But never mind, they are really, really stuck at sea with a crippled boat. Just take our word for it.<br /><br />The dialogue is predictably ridiculous ("We're not sinking. We're taking on water.") Fortunately by an amazing coincidence a deserted island is right next to them. For some reason they decide to send the Professor and students ashore to look for scrap metal to repair the boat (really?) while Mrs. Anne Babbish (Carmen Electra, who is clearly here only because of her name and sundry assets, not because of any contribution to the plot whatsoever) is in charge of vessel repairs. She has two Spanish speaking deckhands who work hard and Laura (Morgan Thompson) the lovely welder to do the work. That's a good thing, because as senior officer onboard with her ship sinking what do you think she does? Well, obviously she changes into a bikini and soaks up some rays on deck. While all that's going on, the kids are getting into petulant arguments and exploring the island, and believe me they cannot get eaten fast enough for my taste. I hope that shark is famished.<br /><br />If the plot isn't enough to make you laugh out loud, the acting and terrible CGI will. I have some seen some awful shark movies, but this is one of the worst on a whole bunch of levels. The effects are utterly laughable, and among the least scary of any of The Asylum movies. (That's saying something.) I truly enjoy how the entire scale of the shark varies by orders of magnitude throughout the film. Bonus points for that. The backstory unspools in an even sillier way than you would expect: voluptuous, angst-laden, uptight blonde heroine Kate (Brooke Hogan, Hulk's daughter) enrolled in the semester at sea because she was spooked by a shark in the ocean when she was 12, and hasn't been in the water since then. This is not how normal human beings make decisions. As they explore the deserted island which has well-developed roads, infrastructure, and even a church, they discover two boats which prompts the line "Hey guys do you think these will work?" For what? What part of "boat" don't they understand? What was the point of going to the island again? Never mind. Fortunately Kate is an engineering-mechanic-welding savant and fixes the boats with the help of smart guy Paul (David Gallegos,) the only remotely likeable member of the cast, while idiot Cole almost kills himself with a spear.<br /><br />It sure was lucky they found this island, wasn't it? Oh, but wait! The shark is making the island have earthquakes and sink into the ocean! The first earthquake injures the Professor's leg to the point he needs to be ferried back to the "Sea King" (why did they ever leave again?) Fortunately they forget about this as he is able to run again within two hours. Assorted mayhem occurs with much CGI thrashing and foam teeth in attendance while idiotic canned interpersonal conflicts occur in abundance. Cole steals one boat for the cool kids, leaving Kate and Paul on the other. Oddly many of the students elect to stay on the sinking island as the boats race toward the "Sea King." This scene will have you praying for natural selection to work its wonders. Cole comes up with an ingenious plan to jump into the water and swim for the "Sea King" abandoning the boat's other occupants to the shark. Sadly Kate rescues Cole and when back in shallow water explains where their relationship stands in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />Because this is going nowhere everyone comes ashore, abandoning the "Sea King." (Oh, whatever.) While Cole emotes over the loss of his party buds, the Babbish clan comes up with a brilliant plan: sink the "Sea King." No, seriously. You mean that boat they just left floating over there? Yes. Apparently they believe that it would be safer than staying on the visibly sinking atoll, because that would trigger its EPIRB (they don't call it that) to summon help. Turns out you don't really have to do that, but for the plot to work that's the best idea they've got. Paul (the student who should be in charge because he's the only one who knows anything about the ocean, fish, or boats) comes up with an alternate plan: fix the "Sea King." Brilliant! There's an elaborate subplot about distracting the shark with an electric bridge (don't ask) while the Professor sends, of all people, archenemies Cole and Kate to fix the "Sea King." (Suspension of disbelief is key here, people.) A favorite moment is when Professor Babbish watches the shark and yells "It's confused!" For a moment I thought he was talking about the plot, but nope, just the fish. Kate starts welding to fix the amusingly fake "hull damage" while the shark gets tired of its electroshock therapy and destroys the bridge, freeing it up to do more important things. Like eating.<br /><br />Cole steals the "Sea King" as soon as the welding is complete, leaving Kate alone in the water. You'd have thought she was imperiled what with the giant mutant shark on the loose, but no, she just wades ashore. Suffice it to say that Cole doesn't get far, and the Professor's original plan is put into action, though this is lost on the cast for some reason. As the island sinks ever lower in the water, most people run inland, but two particularly dim coeds run to stand on the smallest, spindliest dock imaginable, then precariously perch on the very edge of said dock saying "I think we're good." What do you, the audience, think? Do you think huge two-headed sharks can leap clean over a dock? I won't tell.<br /><br />Because this in an Asylum movie, there's not quite enough going on yet, so what do you think could go wrong next? Volcano? Good guess, but wrong. Enormous altruistic intervening squid? Again, good guess, but no. How about this one: tidal wave. Sadly, it's true. As it strikes the island the Babbishes have one last kiss as they are engulfed simultaneously by the rogue wave and the central character of the film. To seek refuge from the shark the remaining kids seek refuge in a church, which the shark treats as a snack basket before getting hopelessly lost inside. (It's a small church, but sharks have small brains.) Paul even gets to beat it on the snout with a crucifix. I am so not joking. The film concludes with a wholly ridiculous plan and multiple acts of bravery, and Kate and Paul finally putting us out of our misery by climbing onto the rocks of the island and waiting for the rescue helicopter which promptly shows up as the credits start to some truly awful music.<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras, none of them good. There is a "Gag Reel" which consists of a couple of minutes of assorted clowning and bloopers. It may be the single lamest blooper reel I have ever seen. Don't waste your time. There are some trailers for this and other Asylum movies, and last but least, a "Making Of Featurette." This documentary interviews just about everyone including the costume designer (the "costumes" are shorts and bikinis...really, you needed a costume designer?) It goes without saying that this is pretty boring and self-congratulatory stuff. I was amused when they interviewed Brooke Hogan, the star of the show, that there was no audio of her answers. Nice bonus feature! Don't waste your time with this one either. I will save you the time by summing up: location shooting on water is difficult.<br /><br />"2-Headed Shark Attack" is just another insane monster fish debacle from our friends at The Asylum, no more and no less. If you are looking for brainless B-movie hilarity, I suppose this could be a good choice. Most people will find the cast too obnoxious to endure for 90 minutes, though fans of the feminine form will likely be pleased. It's a given that it's a bad movie, but under the right circumstances, with the right group of people it could bring joy to fans of extraordinarily bad camp. If you want to see a good or a scary movie, though, this is not for you.
This was one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen..<br />The main problem being it takes itself seriously at least Piranha was campy and the effects in piranha were cool,these effects were hilarious in a bad way.<br />they used the same under water CGI shark for almost every scene and when the shark was above water it was like a Muppet.<br />The acting was horrible and I couldn't wait for it to end.There were so many miscues such as people being in 3 feet of water and the shark sneaking up on them yet the shark was supposed to be about 30 feet long and it would be sucking air at that depth. Too many more to even mention.Carmen Electra looked like an idiot trying to be extra sexy throwing back her hair and posing every 5 minutes..She's still beautiful but Really ? It's just plain bad and I like cheesy films.this had no cheese appeal it is an epic FAIL.
It appears Asylum is into the mega/super shark movie business, apparently having invested in a prop or graphic that still hasn't paid for itself. What is the size of this thing? Initially (see front cover) this thing attacks and swallows two skiers whole. Then the next thing you know a far smaller version has a hold of a guy's leg while he attempts to punch it in its nose. In one scene it has a hold of an underwater diver's leg then in the next frame the diver is swimming away with no visible damage to the leg. And how does something this big do shallow water attacks?<br /><br />Once we get past the typical Asylum bad production stuff, we have a decent "B-" grade shark movie. The sound track was fairly decent. I like the metal to give the film a grindhouse feel. A crew of hard body college students get stranded on what could be "Gilligan's Island" in the South Pacific, one that had former residents. They talk about shark feeding frenzies and cannibals. Girls in bikinis and guys with developed pecks. The island shows signs of fairly recent habitation and is manicured. There are boats that need repair at a dock. Once fixed they can be used for rescue or for boat races to litter the sea with shark food. To add to their woes, the tropical paradise is subject to tremors. The shark special effects ranged from laughable (head on 2 headed shark swimming) to pretty decent (stock footage of a real shark). Ample cleavage shots of Kate (Brooke Hogan) throughout the entire film (Hulk's daughter who also can't act).<br /><br />Island tremor special effects consisted of rumbling noises, camera shaking, and people falling down. The funny part was the scenes of people being eaten. The second head added the needed camp cheese for the film that was missing in "Super Shark".<br /><br />F-bomb, girls kissing/groping, nudity (Anna Jackson, Amber English)
I love the O'Connell brothers and Charlie was the only reason I suffered through this piece of crap movie.I know actors have to make a living and most of them are not in the position to pick and choose too much but Charlie should've passed on this one.Horrible acting by all,dumb script,idiotic special effects,Carmen Electra was a joke and what the hell was the director and photographer thinking?The camera was spinning around so much and jumping from one scene to another that it made me nauseous and had to stop the movie every 5 minutes to look away from the TV and take some deep breaths to avoid throwing up.It literally made me sick to watch it.After 30 minutes I couldn't even take it any more,I just fast forwarded to the end.This movie was a complete waste of time and money.I don't know who paid for this movie to be made and put out on Blu-ray but whoever it is,he can write it off on his tax return as a huge loss.
There are good cheesy movies that are so bad, they're fun to watch and then there are cheesy movies that are just bad.  2-HEADED SHARK ATTACK falls in-between.<br />Carmen Electra as a doctor?  Charlie O'Connell as a marine biologist?  Yeah, totally believable---LOL.<br />We have a slew of college students with huge boobs or six-pack abs stranded on an atoll stalked by the hilarious two-headed shark.  The cast is awful; the effects are terrible; and the direction uninspired and inept.  The Asylum boasts a catalogue of 100 films, most of them easily forgettable.<br />There are a few laughs and the ladies are some of the worst screamers committed to celluloid.  Rent don't buy!!
Bad special effects, a shark with two heads which both manage to roar while underwater, poor acting, dumb dialogue and delivery of it, and more!  All very silly but worth a cheap rental just to make fun of it.
I'm a big fan of creature features but this one just plain stunk. Most of the things the characters did in the film didn't make any sense and it seemed as if they were just making it up as they went along unscripted.<br />The shark would show up occasionally to liven it up but not enough to keep interest.Carmen electra's character was ridiculous and she spent her time primping and mugging for the camera to look 'sexy'.<br />I think they told her she was the star of the film or something but she was rarely involved.The rest of the cast never rose above typical victim-of-the-quarter hour status.<br />This was more like one of the new National Lampoon films than a creature feature.
This is the tragic tale of an upset hungry shark who is a mastermind misunderstood genius, and had several powers.<br /><br />The first power was how it would constantly chomp two people at once, and the two people were always the perfect distance apart to line up beautifully with each mouth.  Cosmic synchronicity, or an example of pure shark predatory genius?  We know the true answer.<br /><br />Next, the shark was able to change size immediately.  It would smash an entire boat in its jaws (actually it causes a whole island to sink by crashing its head into the underwater land-part and biting biting biting it), then five seconds later it was sneaking up on people standing in three feet of water.  Obviously it had the secret power to grow and shrink itself, and also the skill of teleporting.  Then, the shark could also regenerate, because when it lost one of its heads - the left one - it would miraculously grow it back while the right head went away.  It kept switching missing heads, because reptiles do that, and sharks and reptiles are the same.<br /><br />It was also attracted to electricity from big engines because electricity made it mad, but it always managed to go out of its way to chew on people.  Hm.  Hey wait a sec.  I guess the island must have had a crazy invisible electrical charge because the shark was very very angry at the island and kept attacking it when it had nothing else to do.<br /><br />The shark bit a guy's leg off, flipped his body into the air with its tail, then launched out of the water to grasp him cleverly in both jaws and rip him apart.  I wanted to give the shark 10 out of 10 for gorgeous synchronized chomping.<br /><br />Next, the shark hid inside a tsunami and flooded the island before and after making the island sink.  The coeds all hid in a floating church that suddenly appeared.  At one point a dude was hitting the shark in the head(s) with a wooden cross that fell off the wall, then they tried to explode it with a plastic barrel and stab it in the eye by going to the blind spot between its heads.  But neither worked because the shark is too tricky and smart for silly humans.<br /><br />No explanation for how or why it had two heads, which was the most pressing unanswered question, because that was clearly the root of all its issues and unhappiness.  When it finally died by biting the engine of another annoying electric boat engine, which caused it to explode, there was a sense of injustice and loss that will take months to recover from.  And no answers, now or ever.<br /><br />The "stars" were Carmen Electra's halter top and a series of well-filled-out bikinis, plus Jerry O'Connell's brother.  But we all know the true star: the talented actor of the hero shark, who went sadly and unforgivably uncredited.
2-headed Shark Attack. Come on people, what were you expecting? This is the type of movie Ed Wood would have made had he been alive today, and it would have been the one he would've been remembered for. This is cheesy, this is bad. But at least, it's entertaining, unlike many of the high budget, high concept blockbusters these days, which are dull and unimaginative. The only reason I'm not giving this four stars is because of the disappointing ending. The filmmakers missed out on a great opportunity to set up the sequel:<br />Where's the 3-headed shark that should've chomped down the rescue chopper at the end?
If you only care for seeing hot girls in their bikinis - this is your movie! That's the only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. I have never seen such a movie have so many girls in bikinis all throughout the movie.<br /><br />The movie itself is horrible made. The shark is a joke. The story is really bad. The CGI is horrible. But, the extras and actors they used were hot!!!!<br /><br />The shark is mostly CGI, but it is done really bad. You won't believe it at all. And, then when it comes up to attack it's a badly made puppet.<br /><br />The worse acting I have every seen! The acting is so bad, I hated see and hearing them talk. You won't believe anything they say. They sound like they are reading every line just before they shot every scene they did.<br /><br />--Spolier Alert--<br /><br />The story really doesn't make much sense at the end. The shark is in the wining situation and everyone should had died based on how they set up their storyline up to that point. The last group of people about 6 people were left. They have no why to get off the island. The island is sinking fast. The shark will kill them once they go underwater.<br /><br />But, now suddenly, when it came down to the last group of people, the island isn't sinking as fast as before. They somehow find a cabin half sunk and they run inside. Three of the 6 members don't make it, where they died and the other 3 escape outside the cabin.<br /><br />Now they are just in the middle of the island and it's still have sunk. They suddenly have a gas barrel flow by them and surprise their still a lot of gas inside. Now, all they have to do is set up a trap and have the shark take the barrel and make it light up and blow up. Well, somehow it doesn't go that way and the main star, she still lived by fighting it off??? Not possible because she was just in the middle of the shark's  two heads hacking at it with a stick! What??? The other girls had a gun and she still didn't live? What luck?<br /><br />Then, the main star gets away and the shark actually eats the barrel and it blow up without any light or fire at all underwater too. But only one head blew up. Then, the last two people makes the shark go after a boat and the shark bites the boat propellers and the whole thing just blows up??? Why??? The gas barrel was gone. Just bitting the propellers wouldn't make the boat blow up because the shark did that to so many other boats before, but this boat must be one crazy boat because this time, it blew up.<br /><br />The movie makes no sense!!! Don't buy or watch this thing!
*Spoilers*<br /><br />In the opening scene this 2-headed CGI shark swallows two girls whole. Then later in the film it attacks a group of kids in about three to four feet of water!?!? It seemed to drastically change sizes throughout this awful, albeit humorous film.<br /><br />I think the moment that made me laugh hysterically is when the kids' teacher scratches his leg, falls down on the ground and screams like a 3 year old little girl. I also like the fact that their ship is sinking and the one left in charge (Carmen Electra) decides the best course of action is to sun bathe.<br /><br />Awful CGI, horrible wooden acting from a cast that I couldn't wait to see as shark chum and an incredibly stupid plot, (with MANY plot holes) kills this one almost from the start.
2 headed shark attack is a good movie but it has some flaws to it. I will tell you about it in my review right now.<br /><br />The bad things about this movie is that the asylum is lacking in computer graphics,the acting is ok but,is like the graphics it's kinda youtube graphics(the graphics are low classed). The camera working needs work because the movie is mostly computer graphics they need to show more stuff that does not need any computer graphics. Now the nudity scene it doesn't make any sense in this movie, they shouldn't have any nudity in it. When the shark was chasing the boat, the shark's only head left it was switching sides of it's body and it's pretty embrassing to do that. And finally about the story, this movie would be more better by showing how the shark came into being.<br /><br />The good thing about this movie is that it has a good level of gore, nice level of violence, good action thats happening in some parts of the movie, some suspense. And maybe everybody would like a really good ending.<br /><br />So keep telling what you feel about this movie ok.
A 2-headed shark and Carmen Electra?  Man, I live for B-movies like this one, and nobody does it better than The Asylum.  I was a little worried when I saw Brooke Hogan in the cast list, but we're still talking about a bloodthirsty 2-headed shark on a rampage here (not to mention a gaggle of college girls in bikinis) - what could possibly go wrong?  I'll tell you what could go wrong and does go wrong in this movie - the entire cast is horrible.  You could have built a replica of the Trojan Horse from all of the wooden acting on display here.  And annoying!?  If I had to choose between getting eaten by a 2-headed shark and being shipwrecked with the characters in this movie, I would be giving "suicide by shark" some serious consideration.  Naturally, there are also all sorts of continuity errors, bad special effects, and giant plot holes, but what else would you expect from The Asylum?  Heck, it's part of their B-movie rip-off charm, if you ask me.<br /><br />So some kind of Podunk college offers some kind of Semester at Sea program, which leads to a bunch of scantily-clad college kids sunbathing, flirting, and goofing off onboard a boat while their professor futilely tries to teach them how to use a sextant.  I thought the professor looked like he should be Jerry O'Connell's stunt double (except he isn't a good enough actor to be a stunt double), and now I know why - it's Jerry O'Connell's brother Charlie.  Professor Babish does have one thing going for him, though - he's married to Carmen Electra's character (she's apparently some kind of doctor, but she can barely wrap an injured leg and apparently did her residency at a tanning salon).  Both of them are useless when the ship hits something in the water and suffers a small but significant hull breach.  Luckily, the ship happens to be a short distance away from an atoll, so the professor and kids take a dingy to the island while the crew tries to repair the ship.  That's about the time our two-headed shark shows up to ruin everyone's day.  I won't even try to describe all the stupid shenanigans that go on the rest of the way.  Even if these people didn't needlessly put themselves in danger time and time again, they would only be safe for so long because the atoll they're on is quickly sinking into the sea (which I take as a sign that God hated these characters as much as I did).  Geoff Ward deserves special mention, as he makes a strong run at "most annoying character ever" as a brainless, muscle-bound punk whose arrogance is only rivaled by his cowardice.  Heck, Brooke Hogan plays the only character with half a brain in this entire movie.<br /><br />Two scenes stick out in my mind.  At one point, a certain adult character falls and skins his leg - and cries about it like a two-year-old who had her favorite doll stolen.  You would think this guy is dying a most painful death, when all he really needs is a Band-Aid.  None of the people actually being eaten by the shark carry on like this putz.  The other scene is classic, though, and pretty much stands as the saving grace of the entire film.  The two-headed shark flips this one dude up into the air with his tail, dives down, and then jumps up to double-chomp the guy before he lands back into the water.  I had to rewind and watch that scene over again - it almost makes up for all of the horrible CGI effects and stock footage shots of the shark.  Speaking of bad special effects, the filmmakers originally wanted to have the shark's second head growing out of its forehead.  Now, that would have really been stupid.<br /><br />I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with this film.  Mutant monster movies starring B- and C-grade actors is supposed to be The Asylum's bread and butter, but they really let me down with this one.  2-Headed Shark Attack does feature more gore than I'm used to seeing from The Asylum, but that's about the only positive thing I can take with me from this movie.
Pros:<br /><br />- Cute girls<br />- Boobs<br />- beautiful beach scenery<br />- stupid people getting pwned by a shark<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />- bad acting<br />- completely unrealistic death scenes (eg. a part where the water is obviously 2.5-3 feet deep but then shows the shark under the water in which the shark is at least 5 feet high)<br />- stupid people<br />- cheesy plot<br />- an ending that makes you go "wtf?"<br /><br />Overall, there's far more cons than pro's. But if you want an enjoyable movie experience, and this is what you want to watch,<br />make sure you're with a few close friends and have lots of booze available.
By far the most accomplished (and, it appears, expensive) movie in The Asylum's b- and c-movie library, "2-Headed Shark Attack" establishes early on its intention to be a valentine to cheesy movie lovers, and delivers well on that promise.<br /><br />Director Christopher Douglas-Olen Ray has learned the craft well from his father Fred (director of genre faves "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers" and "Evil Toons"). He's loaded the film up with bikini babes, guys with washboard abs, stupid dialogue and, gloriously, copious gory 2-headed shark attacks. He even finds room for a lesbian nude scene, which he ends with the most memorable shark-kill in the film.<br /><br />"Sliders"-and-nothing-else star Charlie O'Connell is (yeah, he wishes) a college professor who is married to (yeah, he wishes) Carmen Electra, who is (yeah, she wishes) a doctor. The two take a bunch of sexy ninnies on a "Semester at Sea" field trip for some unspecified class, but all those hot coeds would rather (surprise, surprise) go skinny dipping instead.<br /><br />Helen Keller could see where this is going.<br /><br />The 2-headed shark appears out of nowhere (and indeed exists for no reason other than it's the film's titular star) and starts eating people who, conveniently enough, tend to fall into the water two at a time.<br /><br />After their boat stalls, the prof and his hapless crew find themselves beached on an atoll which looks like an abandoned Gilligan's Island and which is, preposterously, slowly sinking.<br /><br />Of course, it's no spoiler to reveal that all the ninnies get eaten, the two plucky outcasts win in the end, and that there are plot holes even a three-headed shark could easily swim through. One literal one involves a gigantic hole the group comes upon on the beach, wonders about for a little while, then moves on. What is it? I don't know. It's never seen or mentioned again. I'm gonna lose sleep over that one.<br /><br />Anyway, The Asylum's obviously spent more money on this movie than its previous DTV flicks, suggesting it's investing its earnings from its earlier cheapies in making slightly better films, which is a positive thing, to be sure. The shark effects are quite passable, much better than The Asylum's "Mega Shark" sillies, and the extra dough spent on location shooting and some good helicopter shots serve the film well. Even the sinking atoll effects are convincing, even if the reason it's sinking isn't.<br /><br />While "2-headed Shark Attack" succeeds well as a DTV b-movie time waster, its greatest success is that it's the Asylum's best example of el-cheapo movie making that exposes its big-budget brethren for the foolish films they are. Nationally released "Shark Night" is just as poorly made, but not nearly as fun as "2-headed Shark Attack." The Asylum's "Princess of Mars" cost a tiny fraction of Disney's quarter-billion-dollar monstrosity "John Carter" and is every bit as pulpy. And I can't wait for The Asylum's upcoming "Abraham Lincoln Vs. the Zombies" to show Hollywood that it doesn't need to pay Tim Burton megabucks to make something silly, preposterous and enjoyable.<br /><br />A rare four stars from me for an effort by The Asylum that's actually worth the DVD's cover price.
Look, this isn't winning any awards in any universe, parallel or otherwise. It's craptacular and it has what you expect from the new age of b-movie schlock: bad CGI, bad acting, b-actors, some boobs.<br /><br />Carmen Electra stretching for most of the film? check.  Brook Hogan making her acting coach grimace? check. really awful acting from a well known actor's sibling: double check. CGI is suspect and fabulously cheesy. Some boobs for those that need some T&A. Worth a few bucks for what it is.<br /><br />If you like this kind of stuff in general, you'll have fun; otherwise, don't bother.
FIRST OFF I LOVE BROOKE HOGAN...BUT MY DAUGHTER IS IN LOVE WITH SHARK MOVIES SOO I WAS LIKE WE HAVE TO GET THIS FOR HER... SHE IS 5 AND EVEN SHE HATED IT .. I HAVE TO SAY THE BOOBS IN THIS MOVIE AND THE GRLS KISSING WAS A LIL TOO MUCH FOR MY KID BUT ALL IN ALL SHE LOVED THE SHARK BUT THAT WAS IT THE MOVIE IN SOME SCENES HAD CARTOONISH QUALITY. I LOVE THE FACT THAT BROOKE HOGAN LOOKS BORED THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE AND ALOT BITCHY..LOL.. IM GLAD SHE DIDNT DIE BUT PLEASE DONT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIE OR EVEN YOURSELF... IT TOOK 2 HOURS OUT OF MY LIFE...
for me and my family we thought this was good due to the special afects they put into this. we thoght of this as a good movie.
I have read so many mixed reviews about this but in the end, after all that waiting, I enjoyed it... it was a great, fun B Grade Movie and after seeing the great, and In my opinion scary/intense trailer for this epic looking movie I must say that this film although wasn't scary, was still a little over decent!<br /><br />Plot: twenty three college students (including their two professors played by Charlie O' Connell and Carmen Electra) are struck with their first sign of bad luck when they hit a rare mega mouth shark that soon gets caught on the propeller and jams their boat but that's not the end of it for as soon as they find land (an atoll) they soon find out that a birth defected 40-45 foot two headed shark is stalking, eating, and ripping apart the<br />Co-eds and apparently is very hungry. If things couldn't get any worse the atoll is sinking due to the coral reef that supports the island being damaged! What more could go wrong?<br /><br />Review: Let me start off my review with saying that this movie has so many flaws that it isn't even funny! Like being able to hold a mega mouth shark that surely was at least 2000 pounds with a hook and not getting pulled into the ocean (as Charlie O' Connell was able to do) and saying that the only way they can send out their beacon is to scuttle (sink) the boat (as Charlie O' Connell says) as well as the radio antenna snapping off for the most impossible reason, peoples superb visuals (such as one of the characters screaming "Civilization" when they are over a mile away) and screaming "There's no way out" when there is an island right in behind them (well what is left of the island, but it's still better than nothing) etc. After all that I must say some positive things at least. The CGI, it was decent most of the time and downright cartoony the other few times. I was surprised by some of the deaths such as having people being torn to pieces which was quite graphic and I have never seen that in a Syfy channel original, let alone a Asylum movie. The acting was okay and it had a couple of good characters that actually were funny and had decent dialogue. The trailer was scary as all hell I think the thing that really got me was the fin coming at Brook Hogan but they quickly took away the suspense by getting rid of that atmosphere and suspenseful music and replacing it with cheesy nonsense! I hope they do make a sequel but with a bigger budget..., maybe it could be  a 3 HEADED SHARK called the Cerberus Shark or something as long as it's done right I'll watch it.... because Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus got a Sequel and that was immensely worse than this!<br /><br />Acting: Brook Hogan played a good role and she has a fear of sharks for the movie which is able to be overcome which I adore that idea because most of these kinds of movies have a story like hers and they forget about it and never bring it up again! Carmen Electra was also decent but when she sunbathed I was wondering if she was either getting a tan or posing for the camera. Charlie O' Connell was okay it looked like he put to much effort in it which is sometimes a good thing but in this situation, no, just no!<br /><br />Gore: People are ripped apart sometimes very graphically and sometimes very cheaply but I like the fact that they tried to make this movie as big and epic as they could and sometimes it paid off but other times it was a little ridiculous. one scene of gore that I was let down by though is when a character was bitten on the leg and then the shark let go and either they forgot the put the blood and missing leg effect in or the person was just caught in the gums but all in all it had pretty damn good special effects for a TV movie even if they used some of the same shots over and over and also one of the characters was put in as CGI while she was being attacked and over all it looked wicked cartoony for that scene!<br /><br />Bottom Line: Not what I was hopping for but it still delivered. It was obviously a cash in on Piranha 3D and Shark Night 3D but I do believe that this was better than Shark Night 3D. Piranha 3D however is still a great movie filled with idiots who make stupid decisions. This movie was pretty much the same but it was filled with idiotic morons and even stupider decisions which sometimes actually worked even when it was humanly or scientifically impossible.<br /><br />Official MPAA: Rated R for bloody creature violence, some sexuality/nudity, and language<br /><br />Body Count 26<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 6<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 3 (I would give it a 3 and a half but sadly this site will not let me)
I love terrible movies, so Asylum is, as you may well imagine, one of my favorite studios.  Anytime I pop in a movie and see "The Asylum" listed in the opening credits, I know I'm in for a treat.  That said, their movies tend to be rather average as far as terrible movies go.  Every once in a while they put out a real gem like their version of Sherlock Holmes or 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which really go above and beyond in the way that awesome terrible movies should, but for the most part you know exactly what you're getting into with one of these, and 2 Headed Shark Attack is no exception.  You go in expecting a terribly animated two headed shark eating its way through scantily clad co-eds whose acting skills are about on par with your local college's rendition of Macbeth.  And that is exactly what you get.  And it is just as awesome as you would expect.  If you think that sounds awesomely stupid, then you'll like the movie.  If you think it just sounds stupid, then you should probably stick to whatever hideous dramas you usually watch instead and leave the awesome two headed sharks who ride tidal waves across an island (excuse me, atoll) to those of us who appreciate things of such caliber.<br /><br />The plot of the movie involves a college class in something or other which is on a sea cruise (for educational purposes, of course!) with the stupidest professor who ever lived and his Carmen Electra.  I mean wife.  Anyway, they hit the most poorly animated dead mega-mouth shark that has ever existed, poke it with a long stick, and somehow make a hole in their hull, so they head for a nearby atoll.  Unbeknownst to them, the area is home to a two headed shark whose origins are never even guessed upon in the movie.  It just exists and no one questions it.  The professor suggests that they look around for... scrap metal... on an uninhabited tiny island.  Which goes about as well as you would expect.  Then the island starts collapsing into the sea for no reason while the shark eats everyone.  Did I mention that the island (sorry, atoll) is magical and constantly changes sizes and shapes depending on the angle they are filming at?  One second it is about the size of a shopping mall, and the next you see it in the background and it looks like the coast of Florida.  And then it sinks and later is back above water so it can sink several more times.  It is glorious.<br /><br />In short, who cares what the plot is.  The more ridiculous the better.  And this is certainly ridiculous.  All that you really need to know is that a bunch of hot girls who packed nothing but bikinis are stranded on a deserted island with a couple amazingly stupid roiding jocks (which makes for awesome dialog, by the way, such as one of them excitedly shouting "Protein!" when a giant squid washes up on shore) being hunted down by a giant two headed shark that roars like a lion.  What more do you want from this movie?
Movies produced by the Asylum are either very good or very bad. There's very little area in between. Two Headed Shark Attack is one of their best efforts. The shark f/x were very good. It was a very entertaining movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shark movies.
I have to see anything that has Shark in the title so I couldn't wait for this one.  It was surprisingly enjoyable.  I don't usually laugh during horror movies but I giggled throughout this ridiculous thing.  The acting is truly horrible, like 1st grade play awful.  The shark changes size throughout the movie.  First it's the size of a speed boat or even bigger then it sneaks up on some boobs in 3 feet of water!<br /><br />If you're into cheesy movies and don't mind nudity then you have to rent this.
2 Headed Shark Attack is a creature feature that is obviously trying to cash in on the minor success of Piranha 3D. And it's not a bad movie, but it lack the bloody shock value of Piranha. There is gore, but it's not over the top. If you like Sy-Fy original movies, you should check it out though, as it's better than a lot of the movies shown on the Sy-Fy Channel. And it's got Carmen Electra looking 20-something at 39.
Starring: Carmen Electra and Brooke Hogan.<br /><br />Scary fish story that really has alot going for it - Scares,Girls in bikinis and a creature that is NEW !<br /><br />So let's go out to sea and study,No not like "The Suite Life On Deck",But more like Fred Olen Ray `Showtime' movies in the water.<br /><br />There are villians without fins and people with Brains & Boobs.<br /><br />The creature effects are really good looking as CGI and just fun when do in real time and on set with actors interacting with the teeth plus.<br /><br />This ATOLL set would make a great tourist attraction with a re-tooled `BRUCE the shark' that was replaced at Universal Studios,Florida.
