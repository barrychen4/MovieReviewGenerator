It is a funny movie, but I think there is way too much cursing, it takes away from the movie....
It's a comedy who done it, featuring alot of the old school hip-hop artists. After seeing the movie on BET recently it brought back all of the good memories relating to the actors and the musicians and I went searching to buy a copy.
I won't claim to know all of the rappers that are contained in the movie but it is a good laugh much as "Car 54 where are you?" with Rosi O is. Plus, Dennis Leary is great and "Duff" from MTV (VJ around 1990-91) also makes a cameo.....very cute! I would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laugh.<br /><br />MJ
This is a great movie especially if you were a young adult during the early 90's.  Dr. Dre and Ed Lover are a great pair, very funny.  Dennis Leary is hysterical.  So many quotable quotes!  The parade of rap stars actually enhances the movie. It's not a serious movie, more like really long funny skit.
Though it was never an Oscar contender, it was funny as h***!!!
