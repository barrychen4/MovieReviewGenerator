Nominated for three Emmys, Hunter stands out as one of the premiere action police dramas of the 1980s. Just as Tom Selleck's on-camera charisma carried Magnum, P.I. through nine highly-rated seasons, Fred Dryer's knack for drawing an audience to his unique persona carried an otherwise lackluster series through much of the decade. The brainchild of Frank Lupo, creator of The A-Team (1982) and writer for such hit series as Battlestar Galactica (1978), Magnum, P.I. (1980), and Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), Hunter is built on the clich&eacute;d concept of a rogue cop who breaks the rules and takes justice into his own hands. Dryer does well in his role as the Clint Eastwood of the small screen, yet the show's writers give him little to work with in terms of a highly developed character and, as the seasons pass, the plot becomes quite formulaic. Nevertheless, Hunter is pure mind-numbing police chase entertainment with the added element of nostalgia for those who long for the 1980s when Hunter ruled along with The A-Team, Magnum, Miami Vice, and Knight Rider, and I for one loved those shows...!<br /><br />Hunter follows the life of Los Angeles Police Department detective Sgt. Rick Hunter (Fred Dryer), a renegade cop whose family has ties to organized crime. This family tree, coupled with a penchant for getting his partners injured and a propensity to bend the rules, make Hunter an unpopular guy within the department. Only two officers will even agree to partner with him - Bernie Terwilliger (James Whitmore Jr.), who's a total incompetent, and Dee Dee McCall (Stepfanie Kramer), a stunning brunette with a rebellious streak of her own (and also disliked by her colleagues). Together, Hunter and McCall are a perfect fit as partners, breaking up crime rings, solving murders, and dealing with internal problems such as irate captains. In seasons one and two, Hunter's bosses are a thorn in his side. But both are soon replaced by Capt. Charles Devane (Charles Hallahan) who plays the role of Hunter's by-the-book, yet generally amiable authority figure for the remainder of the series. Meanwhile, original Saturday Night Live cast member Garrett Morris plays a brilliant recurrent role as police informant Arnold "Sporty" James... Overall, Hunter is a solid and highly entertaining action/adventure police drama series, one indispensable to 1980s TV aficionados...<br /><br />The Hunter (Season 2) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere "Case X" in which Dee Dee goes undercover as a prospective model when a modeling agent's clients start turning up dead. When Hunter and Dee Dee discover that the modeling agent is sending his clients to a photographer who specializes in filming porn, the two get closer to discovering the true identity of the murderer... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include "The Big Fall" in which Hunter and Dee Dee must discover the identity of the murderer who killed the star witness under their protection or else risk being pinned with the rap themselves, and "Death Machine" in which Hunter and Dee Dee must investigate a series of underworld murders ordered by a jewel smuggler who was ripped off for over two million dollars by a pair of petty burglars...<br /><br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Hunter (Season 2) DVD:<br /><br />Episode 21 (Case X)<br /><br />Episode 22 (Night of the Dragons)<br /><br />Episode 23 (The Biggest Man in Town)<br /><br />Episode 24 (Rich Girl)<br /><br />Episode 25 (Killer in a Halloween Mask)<br /><br />Episode 26 (Rape and Revenge: Part 1)<br /><br />Episode 27 (Rape and Revenge: Part 2)<br /><br />Episode 28 (Million Dollar Misunderstanding)<br /><br />Episode 29 (The Big Fall)<br /><br />Episode 30 (Waiting for Mr. Wrong)<br /><br />Episode 31 (Think Blue)<br /><br />Episode 32 (Blow-up)<br /><br />Episode 33 (War Zone)<br /><br />Episode 34 (Burned)<br /><br />Episode 35 (Scrap Metal)<br /><br />Episode 36 (Fagin 1986)<br /><br />Episode 37 (62 Hrs. of Terror)<br /><br />Episode 38 (Death Machine)<br /><br />Episode 39 (The Setup)<br /><br />Episode 40 (The Beautiful & the Dead: Part 1)<br /><br />Episode 41 (The Beautiful & the Dead: Part 2)<br /><br />Episode 42 (The Return of Typhoon Thompson)<br /><br />Episode 43 (Saturday Night Special)<br /><br />The DVD Report
GREAT ENTERTAINING ACTION PACKED TELEVISION. The DVD sound and quality are fantastic.
Any Hunter fan will be thrilled to have this video!  It contains some of the best episodes written for the series.  I couldn't wait to pop this DVD into my player and enjoy!
Hunter was not a great TV series but, compared to most of what's available now, it was terrific. Hunter, an honest but  maverick cop from a criminal background, was adeptly played by former football star Fred Dryer (the only player in NFL history to score two safeties in one game). His partner Dee Dee McCall was played by beautiful and spunky Stepfanie Kramer. Together they broke every rule in the book but always got the bad guys, no matter how the odds were stacked against them. Hunter wasn't an accurate portrayal of police work, and it definitely wasn't politically correct, but it was a lot of fun. I'm glad that it's now available on DVD.
this is from a Project Manager  at<br />Mill Creek Entertainment<br /><br />Good Morning The masters of the episodes that were provided to Mill Creek Entertainment by the producers are the syndicated versions.  With regards to the music issues surrounding the Hunter television series, the majority of the programs contain the original music as it was broadcast.  There are some episodes where the original songs were removed by the producer for reasons unidentified to Mill Creek.<br /><br />Terry
I am a huge fan of this classic tv cop show of the 80's.  Sgt. Rick Hunter was a tough, no-nonsense, type of cop that had the perfect partner in Dee Dee McCall.  The chemistry between the two characters was great!  During the second season, the show really begin to find its groove with some really great episodes.  It would evolve into one of the most loved cop shows of its time.  Some of my favorites from this season include: "Night of the Dragon," "Million Dollar Misunderstanding," "Rape & Revenge," "Fagin 1986," "Scrap Metal," & The Beautiful & the Dead."  These episodes truly show the evolution of the series with the first three being more like the first season of the show focusing more on action, while the later three deal more with dramatic storytelling.<br /><br />I own all of the previously released Anchor Bay sets and purchased the first Mill Creek set.  The main thing that I am disappointed in is the lack of original music in these early season sets.  I understand all that has been said about music costs and copyright laws, but it is still a shame that agreements could not have been reached for the fans even if the costs for the DVD's would have had to be more.  As the show progressed, they used less mainstream music, so that will not be as much of an issue for the later seasons.<br /><br />One thing of note about the second season Anchor Bay set is that the show's intro that is included is the exact same as the intro from season one.  While it contains the same opening theme, the season two intro includes many new clips and credits.  You would think that if we cannot have the original music from the episodes, we could at least have the correct opening sequence.  I look forward to seeing this new Mill Creek set to see if the correct intros have been included.  Anyway, Hunter Season 2 will still be a great buy for anyone who loves watching classic 80's tv.  My hope is that Mill Creek will release all 7 seasons of the original series, the tv movies that were made in 1995 & 2002, as well as the 2003 revival series!
The second season of Hunter is a much better edition than the first season.  The writing is much more developed and the storylines are very diverse.  Episodes themselves are distinctive and some deal with controversial subject matter.  For so many episodes the dvd's are a great bargain.  Also, this is a good show for the kids to watch, rather than the junk on tv/internet today....
Hunter was one of the last successful crime show television series that did not try to be an accurate (or more accurate than normal)police procedural.<br /><br />Former LA Rams football player Fred Dryer plays Rick Hunter, a tough-as-nails LA homicide detective partnered with DeeDee McCall, an undercover specialist.<br /><br />The two were as Mutt and Jeff as you can get, and the plots and acting could be downright silly, but it was a fun and entertaining graduate of the Aaron Spelling school of crime drama, and as such, it has its own intrinsic value which is one judged properly by the common TV viewer, not highbrow TV critics who would recommend program that Hunter fans wouldn't watch it they were paid to do so.<br /><br />It's nice to have this series available on DVD.
This is the best TV show I have ever seen. It was translated into Chinese about 10-20 years ago. A whole generation of people watched it everyday. It's one of the best memory we have in our mind. For most of the kids, Hunter and McCall are the biggest heroes. I have been waiting for so many years to rewatch it. Now, I have the chance to get the DVD. It's fatanstic!
This was one of the best police show ever with Fred Dryer and Stepfanie Kramer . What a duo Hunter with his no nonsense approach to thugs and pimps . Stepfanie was no slouch when it came to catching the bad guys ! Its too bad there aren't more shows like this one .We need more shows that will keep a person interested in them like Hunter . WORK"S FOR ME !!
Hunter (1984-1991) 152 eps (7 seasons) {NBC} TV's Dirty Harry, from<br />Stephen J Cannell & Roy Huggins. Fred Dryer (exNFL Ram) as Sgt (later Lt) Rick Hunter<br />"Head Hunter", and his catchphrase "Works For Me" (a la Dirty Harry) & Stepfanie (step-fannie) Kramer as his partner Sgt Dee Dee McCall "The Brass Cupcake".<br />Her Mustang (pilot 1HYD4783),1GQO 548 {also 1MHG 709}. Radio L56.<br />The re-occurring theme is the crappy un-roadworthy cars he gets stuck with!<br />They tame the wild streets of LA. In early seasons his badge #089, later #378<br />season 1 : 7 great & 7 classic of 19 eps.<br />season 2: 12 of 23 great eps + Classic 2-part ep # 20-21
The second season of Hunter began with a bang, so to speak. & led up to the most shocking event in Hunters' history, the two part episode "Rape & Revenge". One of my favourite episodes!<br />Nonetheless, the entire season is here. Picture quality is acceptable & audio is adequate, due to the age of the source material.<br />Of course, I'm still not to crazy about those paper sleeves that house the discs! I guess in order to make the price attract enough, Mill Creek decided to package the discs that way! I replaced them with some plastic hubs I had, so removal & replacement will not cause the discs to be scratched.<br />I'm looking forward to purchasing the entire series eventually, especially since the price has dropped since it was originally up for pre-order!<br />If you are a fan of this series, I highly recommend purchasing same & adding it to your library!
Hunter is one of the shows that I never watched much when it was on before but now almost anything is better than what you can find over the airwaves so thought I would give it a shot and sure enough it is great, exciting and fun!  Why is seasnon 3 so expensive?  Enjoy it in the evenings.
Not much else to add to the terrific detailed reviews here, but this is a great old series from the 80s.  I have since replaced it with Law & Order, but no other police shows held my attention for a long time when Hunter ended.  Great chemistry between Hunter and McCall, like some of the other police shows, but they were fun in a different break-the-rules kind of way.  Two thumbs up.  I'll still be watching this when I'm in the nursing home (I'll be the old lady tightly holding onto the DVD player humming the theme song...).
I don't see why they feel the need to re-release this 1985-86 Season of this police drama out on DVD since Anchor Bay already has the first 3 seasons out on DVD along with the fact that they still haven't released the remaining 4 seasons of HUNTERs 7-year run on NBC yet either.<br /><br />My guess on why they're re-releasing HUNTERs 2nd Season out on DVD is perhaps due to wanting to compensate for all the flaws & boo boos they made on the first 3 seasons of HUNTERs DVD box sets since Anchor Bay did kind of a cheesy job on them.<br /><br />However, HUNTERs 2nd Season is a definite upgrade from HUNTERs 1st Season as well as the season when Bruce Davison joins the cast & crew as Hunter & McCall's superior officer (Capt.Wyler)at the fictional Metropolitan Police Department in L.A. replacing his predecessor Capt. Dolan(John Amos)and when John Shearin joins the cast & crew as Hunter & McCall's remarkable streetwise fellow officer(Lt. Ambrose Finn)which made his first appearance in the "Blow-Up" episode & when Hunter & McCall's doofus fellow officer Det. Bernie Terwilliger#James Whitmore, Jr.) gets transferred to Internal Affairs & eventually gets promoted to lieutenant.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, James Whitmore, Jr. directed quite a few episodes of this police drama too like "Night Of The Dragons", "Rich Girl", "The Big Fall", "The Set-Up", "High Noon In LA", "Sniper", "Avenging Angel" etc.<br /><br />In this season, it was also interesting seeing<br />*Gary Graham in the "Killer In A Halloween Mask" episode before his co-starring days on the short-lived Fox series ALIEN NATION<br /><br />*Robert O'Reilly in "The Set-Up" episode before his co-starring days on STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE<br /><br />*Marc McClure on "The Beautiful & The Dead" episode before his co-starring days on THE WONDER YEARS<br /><br />*Don Stroud in "The Biggest Man In Town" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lussen on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET<br /><br />*Jack Colvin in "The Set-Up" episode after his co-starring days as the obsessed newspaper reporter#Jack McGee#on THE INCREDIBLE HULK<br /><br />*Kabir Bedi in "The Beautiful & The Dead" episode before his co-starring days on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL<br /><br />*Robert Davi in the "Million Dollar Misunderstanding" episode before his co-starring days on PROFILER<br /><br />*Mills Watson in "The Big Fall" episode after his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO<br /><br />*Thom Christopher in the "62 Hours Of Terror" episode after his co-starring days as Hawk on BUCK ROGERS<br /><br />*Miguel Fernandes in "The Return Of Typhoon Thompson" episode before his co-starring days as Grant & Doyle's superior officer#Sgt. Harry Santos# on the short-lived rivived police drama THE NEW ADAM-12<br /><br />*Danny Ponce in the "Rape & Revenge" episode before his co-starring days as Willie on THE HOGAN FAMILY<br /><br />Anchor Bay and Mill Creek should've also provided a posting of each episodes original air-date on NBC like Warner Bros. does for a lot of their DVD box sets like CHiPs, WONDER WOMAN, and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD<br /><br />For instance, the original air-date to each of these 1985-1986 episodes are<br />9/21/85: CASE X<br />9/28/85: NIGHT OF THE DRAGONS<br />10/5/85: THE BIGGEST MAN IN TOWN<br />10/19/85: RICH GIRL<br />10/26/85: KILLER IN A HALLOWEEN MASK<br />11/2/85: RAPE & REVENGE#Part 1#<br />11/9/85: RAPE & REVENGE#Part 2#<br />11/16/85: MILLION DOLLAR MISUNDERSTANDING<br />11/23/85: THE BIG FALL<br />12/7/85: WAITING FOR MR.

Contains all the seasons - if you are like me and watched Hunter as a kid - this DVD is for you. Don't forget the first and third seasons either.
I grew up watching "Hunter" on television and I have to say that if anyone has ever been a fan, these DVD seasons of Hunter are a must have.  Season two is excellent, this shows the ever more popular demonstration of how Hunter and DeeDee become close friends and respect each other as individual persons instead of just partners.  DeeDee does experience her tragic moment when she is raped by Raul Marionone, furthermore, Hunter of course in his daring fashion, is shot and must recover from his injuries in order to battle Raul later.  Furthermore, some great episodes are in Season 2, such as: Scrap Metal, Night of the Dragons, and of course Rape & Revenge Parts I and II.  Furhtermore, I love the episodes of The Beautiful and the Dead Parts I and II.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are visual interviews and commentaries in the bonus sections of these DVDs Seasons in which the actors of Fred Dyer and Stepfanie Kramer talk about their experience working in the show, and other interviews are from Stephen J. Cannell and Mike Post.  Also, on the inside of each of the covers of the DVD cases, has a description of the actors lives and how they came to be on the Television show called Hunter.<br /><br />If you want to know more about what happens in the episodes, you will have to buy this DVD collection.<br /><br />I only hope that the rest of the series will get published over time, right now in the Western United States there are only Seaons I, II, and III, for sale.
This show is AWESOME, and so is Season2, I grew up watching HUNTER, I mean Fred Dryer as Sgt. Rick Hunter and sexy Stepfanie Kramer as his sexy partner and friend Dee Dee McCall, plus in Season 2 you had Bruce Davison as No Nonsense Capt. Wyler.<br /><br />This season has put Hunter on notice, and this is the most popular Saturday Night Police Drama of the 80's.<br /><br />also there was even Rape and Revenge and The Beautiful and the Dead (both 2 part series).<br /><br />This show along w/Magnum P.I., Knight Rider, Miami Vice, and even T. J. Hooker as well as WISEGUY helped change the face of Police Drama in the 80's.<br /><br />God Bless Fred Dryer and Stepfanie Kramer on their excellent performance and God Bless Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell on a job well done.
I wish this show was still on the air. I thought it was the best detective show ever on TV. Every week's episode was a totally different storyline. The chemistry between Stepfanie Kramer and Fred Dryer was comparable to Bogey and Bacall. I can't believe it has been over 20 years since the 1st episode aired. Long live Hunter in re-runs and on DVD.
I haven't finished viewing all the dvd's for this series. I have been unable to view so far 2 of the programs out of 3 dvd's because they are garbled. Other than that, it arrived quickly. I still have another dvd to go before I'll know whether any other shows will be unwatchable.
I luv the dvd however my mistake for not reading all the dvds that are offered here on amazon. I just realized that there is one dvd that is ALL SEASONS and i got individually seasons1-4. Im sad about that action I did:(
I am a big fan of the older television shows from the 70's and 80's.<br />These shows are rarely brought back to TV, so its great to be able to find it on DVD. I would like to see more shows on DVD,such as Emergency and Chips.
We enjoyed Hunter - Seasons One and Two. I'm very disappoinsted and confused that Season Three is priced way out of my price range. I hope Season four comes out soon and is reasonably priced.
EXCELLENT,  my husband was  thrilled  with this purchase  as well as  Season One.  I always have great resulsts with Amazon and their  vendors.  Thanks  again,  Never Disappointed.Toni 57
THIS DVD IS SO GOOD YOU WILL WANT TO KEEP WATCHING WITH OUT STOPPING .
Even though I like the actors, and the plots were what one would expect, the dialog and editing left me wondering why I liked the program when it aired on TV.
Mill Creek remains crappy as usual.  The movies that work, are good.  I don't know why Sgt. McCall always had to go under cover as a hooker tho'.  There's lots of other things to go undercover as....!
THIS SHOW IN UP THERE WITH A TEAM AND HAPPY DAYS AS THE BEST SHOWS ON TV EVER I GOT THE FIRST SEASON THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT  I OWN OVER 2000 DVDS AND BOX SETS AND HUNTER IN THE TOP 2 A TEAM BEING NUMBER ONE GET THIS SET RIGHT AWAY:) ITS AMAZING
