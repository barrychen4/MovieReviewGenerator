I love City Hunter. But the people selling City Hunter 3 and '91 must have learned selling techniques from drug dealers. I was able to buy the first two seasons of City Hunter, which are like - 52 episodes each, mind you - for between 20 and 30 bucks. Now they want over two hundred dollars for a season that's not even half the usual amount of episodes? And I mean I love that show, but that's ridiculous.
If this season would consists of two collections (like the first two), there would have been 5 stars on top of this review.<br /><br />Still, it's better than nothing, though I had this nagging feeling the season didn't reach it's full potential. A few more episodes might have done the trick. :)
