Locked Down is yet another low budget MMA flick that uses UFC stars as it's main hook. It's not bad but it's not great either. Forrest Griffin, Cheick Kongo, Rashad Evans, and the biggest disappointment in UFC/MMA history, Kimbo Slice show up and are actually quite entertaining for this type of film. Forrest and Rashad might headline legit action films one day. If Channing Tatum can do it, so can these guys. Tony Schiena stars as a MMA enhanced cop set up by crooked witnesses/jurors after a drug bust goes sour. Of course, he's locked down with criminals he helped put away and his biggest nemesis, Vinnie Jones now has the warden, guards, and most convicts in his pocket. Jones runs a cage fighting racket, prostitutes, and every thing else you can think of from inside the prison's walls. It doesn't take long before Schiena is pushed to face a few goons in the cage and eventually, Vinnie's top fighter (Lance Cartwright) in a death match. A cutie from IA (Sarah Ann Schultz) takes an interest in Schiena's case and it's up to her to get our hero out of prison before he gets killed in there. Locked Down is a decent rental and nothing more. How many MMA prison flicks do we need anyway? Van Damme and Seagal did it before the Undisputed series and it's totally played out at this point. We don't mind direct to dvd quality MMA fare but these hack filmmakers need to start coming up with some new ideas. Rent it and watch with a lunchtime sandwich & soup combo.
I carry virtually all of the Tapout/MMA films as their group has a following locally, but customers have also gotten picky about which films to watch as these movies are blurring together in plots and generic fights. Overall, this one carries a rent-worthy recommendation for a few reasons I will list, but the acting was so bad throughout that you find yourself fast-forwarding to the next slo-mo/music video fight sequence to finish it. Essentially this is the same cast/crew from the movie mentioned below with Kimbo, but just a little more polished.<br /><br />The story follows a cop getting framed then imprisoned where most of the guys he locked up also are residing. Vinnie Jones plays the fight club operator in this prison, who sadly enough we do not ever get to see him fight in this. The MMA cast gets intermittent screen time throughout and I figure only fans of these guys will be checking in on this so I will list them out:<br /><br />Forrest Griffin: Has a short role in the beginning of the film as a bad guy, has one short fight sequence with one corny line or two, gone before you know it.<br />Kimbo Slice: Gets some over-the-top cage fighting time in a couple of sequences, lots of close-ups and slow-mo for his bouts, but nothing different from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EA45DG">Circle of Pain [Blu-ray</a>].<br />Lance "Snake" Cartwright: Gets the most screen time and has a formidable presence. Any fan of his career will want to watch this film just for him, he has quite a few cage scenes.<br /><br />The Blu picture quality is quite good, with the interior shots getting plenty of chances to falter but they don't, especially since they were using some decent cameras for the large volume of slow-mo shots. There were several outdoor shots that had horrible grain and no clarity but the main recommendation point of this BD is the sound anyway. The music is amped heavily in each fight and the sound effects get a solid DTS treatment. If you are looking to test your channels with hard music and brutal fights this would be a decent BD to do that with. The special features include:<br /><br />Behind the scenes, 4:17 minutes. Forgettable, nothing there.<br />Fight Choreography, 2:00 minutes. This is essentially Arnold Chow's film so he gets a quick chance to prove his worth as the behind-the-scenes fight guy. He has done some nice work in the past but this clip was not worthy enough to showcase his talent.<br />Interviews, 17:01 minutes. Just more behind the scenes clips and bad sound interviews. The only one of these worth watching is Forrest's, as Kimbo's segment does not even have him talk really.<br />Promos, 2 minutes. Some quick shots of kids getting started in the circuit and some training sessions, should have been a lot longer as this could have been way more informative.<br /><br />Vinnie gets some average screen time, Bai Ling was horrible in this, and the main actor who has all the scenes and main fights is not even pictured or credited on the cover art (Tony Schiena). 1 star for the story and acting (both weak and bad), but two more stars for the great sound quality and attempting some special features. Region coded A with Spanish track and English subs.
If you are a fan of MMA this movie is quite entertaining.  There are cameos by Kimbo, Forrest Griffin, Rashad Evans, and maybe a couple more that I am forgetting.  And of course Vinnie Jones!  Anyways, the acting is terrible, outside of Vinnie.  The fights scenes are fun and entertaining, but get repetetive.  And there is several unnecessary scenes of naked women, which could be good or bad....to each his own.  If plot is pretty lame, but these movies are rarely written as the plot being the focus.  If you like combat movies this one is pretty good.  Just don't watch if you can't stand bad acting.
