The Moose Hole - Cruise's 'Last' Oscar Stand

Blu-Ray Review
Great movie, clear picture, terrible sound
When should Tom Cruise get an Oscar nomination and wins it ?

The Last Samurai = Oscars...Golden Globes...etc...!!!
"AT LAST!!!" Samurai
Lord of the Rings meets Braveheart but not only..
"Samurai" deserves to be "Last"
PC Samurais
Hilariously Eurocentric
A great story of lost and found honor.
Has the potential, but they fabricated it.
Honor and Beauty in Hollywood
Another distorted Hollywood Blockbuster.
Great movie....let down by a cheesy Hollywood ending !!!
A Grand, But Formulaic Epic.
Epic movie in the traditions of "Braveheart"
Samurai
4.5 but that's not an option.
The Last Samurai is awesome!!!!

Top Gun with Samuri Swords
I loved it
Superb!
GREAT EPIC MOVIE
Would Have Been Great Without Tom Cruise
Fun, but very overrated
Laughed, Cryed, and almost peed in my pants!
entertaining but its not history
The passing of an era
Don't be fooled.  Awesome movie!
The Last Samurai
Japan and the Samurai
A Gentle Epic
Likable, but Lacks Originality
Better than I expected
Understanding The Last Of The Samurai
Entertaining
Dances with Wolves in Japan?
I disagree on the ending...
Tom Cruise plays somone other than himself
Decent but no Kurosawa
I can't believe you don't own this already!
Watchable stuff (you can save the hara kiri for later, Tom)
Don't miss this film
Entertaining, semi-accurate samurai adventure
LET'S JUST KEEP OUR EYE ON THE MOVIE
A Great Movie about Honor and Disappearing Culture
Surprisingly good vehicle for Cruise
Good but not Great....
Fantasy
extremely under-rated... somewhat violent

The Good/ The Bad/ The Ugly
Best movie that was shot in NZ ever.
beauty hides a less than suitable point
DANCES WITH WOLVES Part 2!
worth a try
Excellent, if you are open minded about other cultures.
A Spiritual Journey from the West to the East
Cruise on the Epic Level
Pretty silly
One dimensional
Cruising Japan
I know the Japanese are accomodating, but this is ridiculous!
Extra care taken--Bubble Wrap!!

A near-great samurai epic!
Quasi-historic costume drama

Tom the Swashbuckler!
Try this one on for size...
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"
Where are the American Samurais?
Spectacular but predictable epic.
Dances with wolves but further "east"
Disappointing
Deja vu, anyone?
pretty weak
Honor
Hollywood Trying to make a film about honor?  Please
should give it a 2, but it was ok, and it could have been SOOOOO much better.
Keeps your attention, but don't buy for your collection
poor sound
Not right for the academy
Wow.
Good action movie, but not family friendly.
Wonderful and Spectacular
Very pretty
Beautiful to look at
Total Hollywood
confused
Dances with the Samurai
No research whatsoever
Trite and Been-done-before
The best!
Tom Cruise in his best movie!
A great movie to watch
Great
Fake and pretentious.
Unfortunelty not &quot;The Last Tom Cruise Movie&quot;
Twisted history and morality
The Journey of a Lost Soul and the Story a Dying Culture
The most ironic film of the year
Mocks Japan While Claiming to be "Sympathetic"
Pathetically misguided
Cool
Great movie, but very Disappointing DVD
Dumb and pretentious
beautiful photography, but . . .
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure",
DVD THE LAST SAMURAI
The story sucks, but, um... It has Ninjas!
Good movie
Good movie gone Ronin
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"

An American in Japan
Great Film, If Not Historically Accurate
NOT TRUE SAMURAI
Pretty Good Movie, but...
Tokyo goes Hollywood
Good Story; Bad Execution
See TC play in the mud
The Last Samurai
better left to others......
The Last Samurai or Tom Cruise's Pathetic Bid for an Oscar
Dances with Samurais
This Prison Moon
Beautiful and solid, but not great
This movie sucked
The Last Samurai
Beautifully shot  ~~, if only TCruises character could be.
GOOD IDEA, BUT IT GOES ON TOO LONG
a+

Just Another Anti-West Film
Awful
Last Samurai as seen by the racist dunb kitty
Tarzan redux
Here's the Remade Version Playing in Japan and Asia....
Awful
Terrible...
A little to familiar
The Highest Definition!!!
A film about Samurai from Hollywood.  Now that WOULD be something...
Pretentious movie with Hollywood romantizing unfound concept
"Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"
Omg...very hurtful and insulting.
0 stars but alas that is not possible...
Who? Tom Cruise. Who?
The Last Samurai
Good Movie

Add this to your DVD collection!
I liked this movie!
Of Shame  and Honor - Cruise's Conflict
