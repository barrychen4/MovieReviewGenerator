Really liked this DVD and was just the right pace for me.  The dance moves are great and easy to learn and there are not a lot of good aerobics dvds out there.  I use this one as my staple a few times a week thanks.
I like this DVD. It's not one of my favorites, but it keeps my heart rate up and it's fun. The workout consists of a warm-up, the 3 step blocks, and a cool-down/stretch. The warm-up is about 13 minutes long, which I think is a bit long for a warm-up. The music is niether intrusive nor does it really pump me up. Sometimes, the instructor forgets she's mirroring the people at home and she instructs you to step on the wrong lead leg, which can be frustrating. The cueing is adequate, but instructor also doesn't call out all the moves all of the time- it's not bad, but it's enough to confuse me a little. The moves are challenging, but not as difficult as Amy Bento's advance step challenge series. Some of the synchopated moves are high impact. I would recommend buying this DVD, I enjoy it. However, it lacks the "wow" factor that makes me rate it 5 stars. Don't buy this DVD if you're not an advanced stepper. The workout includes lots of spins and turns and a beginner would get really frustrated. As an aside, the outfits the instructor and her back-up dancers are wearing are horrendous. I find their outfits distracting because they're so ugly.
I really enjoyed this DVD. The moves are so fun and you will sweat up a storm and have your heart rate going throughout the whole routine. The choreography is challenging but fun.
