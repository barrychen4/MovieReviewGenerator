Amy Grant really came of age as a Christian performer with her 1982 "Age to Age" album and concert tour, seen here on this video. "Age to Age" signaled a transition from the folksy tunes of her earlier albums (no doubt influenced by the hippy-flavored Jesus Movement of the '70s) to more trendy and pop-influenced songs. A 22-year-old Amy absolutely shines in this concert video. She's both energetic and down-to-earth, and her enthusiasm infuses every song. I love her interaction with both the audience and the band. Also making an appearance is a young Michael W. Smith playing keyboards, before he struck out on his own. It's a treat to watch a young Amy and Michael performing together, and it's nice to see their life-long friendship at this early stage.<br /><br />The only downside to the video is the middle section with songs performed by Amy's then-husband Gary Chapman. At first I thought he would sing only one, maybe two songs, but he ended up chewing the scenery for a total of FIVE songs, the last of which performed with Amy. Though Gary is a very talented singer and musician, his droll personality was such a downer compared with Amy's light-up-the-room charisma. And his sweaty-face close-ups didn't help with his appeal. The Gary section seemed really out of place in an otherwise flawless concert, which makes me wonder why they gave him center stage in the first place. Was it to give Amy a break and a chance to change outfits, or did her husband want a piece of the pie? Amy's concerts are best when she leaves her spouses out of the limelight (that goes for you, too, Vince).<br /><br />Overall, this is a must-have for Amy fans, especially fans of her early work. Though it's out of print and not on DVD, you shouldn't have a problem finding an old VHS copy for sale for a decent price.
