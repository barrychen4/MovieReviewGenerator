I was astonished by the CLARITY of this DVD.  The visuals are better than they looked when it first aired!  (The sound is great as well.)  As if two 90 minute telefilms weren't enough, there are some excellent bonuses attached.  Kenneth Johnson's commentaries were very interesting. (Who knew that Richard Kiel was the Hulk first and that a few frames of him are in the first telemovie?  Not me!)  The telefilms are a little dated hair/clothes-wise, but the stories really stand the test of time.  This DVD is an essential purchase for the fan of the TV series.  Let's hope they release season sets that are up to this quality!
This was the pilot that started the whole incredible hulk<br />series on television in the 70's.David Banner(Bill Bixby)<br />experiments on himself and accidently exposes himself to<br />very high gamma radiation levels.Banner than becomes the<br />beast as the incredible hulk when he gets angry.This is the<br />show when he was changing the tire and something went wrong<br />that he transformed into the hulk.Not only will you get this<br />pilot on the dvd but you will also get a making of feature<br />from Industrial Light and Magic,A presentation from Lou Farigno,<br />trailers from the Hulk movie from 2003,a making of the incredible<br />hulk theme ride or amusement park,commentary and a bonus episode<br />Married.Married will also have a opitional commentary.I can't wait to get this dvd and I highley recommend it for the two<br />episodes alone.Hopefully season sets can't be far behind.If you<br />like this one I also recommend the Hulk collection that features<br />The Return Of The Incredible Hulk and The Trial Of The Incredible<br />Hulk coming May 6.Also pick up The Death Of The Incredible Hulk<br />Coming the same day as the Original Tv Pilot June 3rd<br />The Hulk(2003)will probebley be a good movie but it won't be the same as the original with Bill Bixby and Lou Farigno.
If Ang Lee's new Hulk movie had ANY positive repercussions, it was for Universal to at last release the original series premiere on DVD.  Having owned MCA's VHS version for years, it is a tremendous treat to watch this in such high quality.  The sound is great, and the picture is razor sharp (compared to its prior versions).  The acting is top notch and comparable to performances today, although the bellbottoms are so 70's!<p>The premiere and the episode "Married" also on this disc were definitely the two best Hulk episodes from a dramatic level.  However, Universal would earn the highest marks from me if they release as another double feature, the two-parters "Promethius" and "The First" (arguably the two best fun episodes).  DVD's are not expensive to make these days, and Universal has the masters in their vaults.  I hope they're reading this!<p>Because the comic book/movie Hulk and the TV series Hulk are two entirely different characters, it is wrong to compare the two.  However, with an actor playing the creature, there is alot more humanity and feeling behind it than someone created by computer.  This DVD is wonderful to watch especially after watching the series as a kid.  It is definitely worth it!
All we need is the rest of it on DVD!  <p>If you think it is merely 'fluff', take a look at the director's commentary!
While the debate will continue to rage regarding the choice to CGI the Hulk in Ang Lee's 2003 movie, there will be no argument about the Incredible Hulk TV series that many people grew up with. <p>Lou Ferrigno, a 330-plus pound behemoth, was so huge in contrast to Bill Bixby's Bruce Banner that the Hulk effect was completely believable, and should still be to this day. The TV series wasn't completely ridiculous or fantastic either; the focus managed to stay on Banner/Hulk as an individual in the world, not as an experiment gone wrong. Banner's loner self is portrayed excellently--he often hitchhikes places or shows jump in mid-sequence with him by himself, just waiting to get picked on. <p>For a 70's effort, the producers managed to pull off some decent and subtle effects as well--before Banner gets &quot;angry&quot; his pupils famously turn a different color, almost a whitish green; his feet expand and rip his shoes apart; and the shirt rips (bicep, back, chest) are all done well enough to make you think he's actually expanding and not just Lou Ferrigno flexing in an undersized shirt.<p>It's not just the superhuman aspect that will draw you in, it's also the emotional side, which this series plays off incredibly well. This television premiere is certainly a must for all fans, but the new entire season DVD set should be factored in when buying this.
Based on the comic book character created by Marvel's maestro Stan Lee, the pilot episode of The Incredible Hulk recounts how scientist David Bruce Banner, exposes himself to an ultrahigh dose of gamma radiation, which then causes him to transform into a huge green skinned creature, known as the Hulk.  The adaptation incorporates very little from the comic mythology, as Banner searches for some way to return to a normal life.<br /><br />Veteran actor Bill Bixby (My Favorite Martian, The Courtship of Eddie's Father) plays David Banner, a man with his insides torn apart with frustration, stemming from his inability to save his wife's life, during a tragic car accident.  Banner works at the Culver Institute with his long time colleague, Dr. Elaina Harding (Susan Sullivan).  Coincidentally they are involved in research on how humans are able to perform superhuman acts of strength, in times of stress.<br /><br />Discovering that gamma radiation may be the cause of great strength in a crisis, Banner exposes himself to an ultra high dosage.  However instead of acquiring super strength, Banner finds that when he gets angry, he transforms into a green skinned muscular giant that comes to be known as "the Hulk".  Portrayed by body builder Lou Ferrigno, the Hulk is extremely powerful and destructive, but not too bright.<br /><br />Banner has no memory of what happens while he is the Hulk.  He confides in Elaina, who helps find out what has happened to him.  A key character in the series, investigative reporter Jack McGee (Jack Colvin) is introduced, setting in place the basic elements for a series that would run for five seasons.<br /><br />Multitalented writer, director, and producer, Kenneth Johnson had already had great success with his creations The Six Million Dollar Man (1974-78), and The Bionic Woman (1976-78), when he was approached about bringing a character from the Marvel Universe to television.  Johnson saw potential in the Incredible Hulk, and he cleverly found a way to adapt the character, and scale down his violent capabilities for series television.<br /><br />The thought process behind the genesis of the series, is discussed in detail by Johnson in a commentary track recorded in 2003.  Johnson has a remarkable memory, and his remarks are extremely insightful and detailed.  Referring to him as "Bix", Johnson's affection and respect for the late Bill Bixby (1934-1993) is evident.  Johnson wrote the screenplay specifically with Bixby in mind, and the actor is absolutely perfect for the role, bringing great vulnerability, humility, and dignity, to David Banner, who tragically is responsible for his own predicament.<br /><br />Susan Sullivan (Falcon Crest, Castle) is so much more than a pretty face, and gives a wonderfully warm performance, that helps to reveal Banner's character.  Jack Colvin is also very good as the pesky reporter, who like a bad rash, just won't go away.  Bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno was primarily selected for his physical abilities, but still manages to display some decent acting skills, conveying much through his facial expressions.  Having lost his hearing as a child, affected Ferrigno's speech, and limited his ability to deliver lines.  The Hulk mostly growls, with his voice provided by Ted Cassidy.  Ferrigno endures heavy application of green makeup, and some wild haircuts.  The same slow motion techniques utilized in The Six Million Dollar Man, are also employed in The Incredible Hulk.  The technique is somewhat effective, though would perhaps become overused.<br /><br />The pilot has some ridiculous moments, topped by David and Elaina attempting to recreate the situation when the transformation first took place.  Locked in a hyperbaric chamber in a secluded lab, Banner loosens a water line to simulate rain, and then generates electrical arcs to simulate lightning.  Elaina witnesses Banner's transformation and destruction of the chamber, and David learns the shocking truth.  Thanks to the troublesome McGee, the lab accidentally blows up.  The Hulk appears to rescue Elaina from the flames, but Banner tragically loses his best friend, and is presumed dead.<br /><br />With the Hulk wanted for murder, the stage is set for David Banner to wander from place to place, like Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1963-67).  Using false names, he tries to keep a low profile and avoid trouble, but somehow always seems to find it, inevitably leading to the appearance of the Hulk.  Trailing the green skinned giant across the country is McGee, who Banner tries very hard to avoid.  This becomes a familiar formula that is repeated through over eighty episodes, from 1977 through 1982.<br /><br />Despite some minor shortcomings, the pilot episode sets up the series nicely, and features wonderful performances by Bill Bixby and Susan Sullivan.  Image quality is good, but a little hazy at times.  The episode has subtitles, and Kenneth's Johnson's commentary is not to be missed.
I watched a lot of episodes of the Incredible Hulk. Although I might not care for a lot of them now, there were a lot of good episodes. Even in the last 10 years with the new releases of Hulk movies, they just aren't the same without Bill Bixby playing David Banner. I wouldn't even say this was the best episode, but because it was the original premiere and explained how the Hulk came to be, it will always be a classic and a must have for any Hulk fan.
Unlike the modern Hulk movies, the director of the live-action television series didn't have high tech special effects at his disposal.  This may have contributed to the fact that this series was about the characters interacting with one another instead of being about violence and special effects.<br /><br />When I was a kid, I didn't enjoy this series much because I had to wait too long to see the Hulk in action.  However, as an adult, I appreciate the fact that Bill Bixby was a great actor and the science fiction aspect of the story was ahead of its time.  Your kids might not sit through this pilot, but the adults in the room will be entertained by the well-written script and superb acting and directing.
This DVD includes the original pilot movie "The Incredible Hulk" that started the series.  On the other side of the DVD is the episode "Married", which was actually the first and second episode of the Second Season.<br />  The Incredible Hulk began on CBS on November 4, 1977.  Bill Bixby plays Dr. Banner.  It has been almost a year since his wife died in a car accident they both were in.  He continually has dreams of not being able to save his wife's life.  He just wasn't strong enough to roll the car over.  That is Lara Parker (Dark Shadows) that plays Dr. Banner's wife.  Now he studies how people are able to become so strong when normally they are not as strong.  A black woman describes how she was able to save her son in a burning car by having the "extra strength" (perhaps adrenaline) to lift the car to save her son.  Eventually, Dr. Banner decides to try an experiment on himself to change his DNA with Gamma Ray exposure.  Well, nothing happens.  But he felt stronger.  He tries to lift a people mover.  Nothing.  It's raining outside.  He becomes more frustrated, his thoughts anger him then the car blows a tire.  More anger.  The lightning intensifies.  He hurts his hand using the jack.  He's in pain.  Suddenly his DNA changes.  His body grows greater, his muscles grow rapidly.  His clothes rip.  His skin becomes green.  He becomes the HULK (played by Lou Ferrigno).  When the Hulk's surge of power finally calms down or when he does an act of kindness, he becomes tired and turns back into his Dr. Banner self.<br />  This tv-series was so good at building monentum and emotion, especially at the end of each episode, that the tv-series kept getting better with each episode.  Bill Bixby was perfect for the role as Dr. Banner. It's a shame he is not around to enjoy this 25th Anniversary.  He died too soon (November 21, 1993).  Such a serious and mature actor. Very well liked.<br />  On DVD, Introduction by Lou Ferrigno.

Writer, Producer &amp; Director Kenneth Johnson delivers big time with a totally re-invented Hulk.  This is not your father's &quot;Hulk SMASH!!&quot; that Stan Lee created for Marvel Comics back in 1962.  This is a thinking man's drama created by the mind of Johnson and delivered by the touching &amp; sensitive performance of Bill Bixby.  It takes on pieces of Hugo's &quot;L'es Miserables&quot; &amp; TVs &quot;The Fugitive&quot; as Bixby's Dr. David Banner is on the run from investigative reporter Jack McGee who believes the creature is a killer after a gamma radiation overdose creates Banner's own Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde nightmare.<p>This Hulk is a drama carved out from comic book origins, a tale of a man losing his wife and the struggle that follows.  If this were the theatre, Bixby's performance would be felt from the back row- loss, angst, wanting, enlightenment, anger, affection- it's all here. Bixby is superb as he weaves through Banner's inner demons.  Susan Sullivan delivers as well as Bixby's fellow scientist trying to help him understand his transformations.<p>The hidden treasure of this DVD is not just re-watching the pilot again a little more sharply both in picture &amp; sound (you still have to love Joseph Harnell's chilling piano), but Johnson's commentary you can add with the push of a button.  His detailed account of when scenes were shot, how they were shot, what his thoughts were going into each shot, warm memories of the late Bixby, and humorous anecdotes really give this DVD a 5-star rating.<p>Kudos to Universal for rounding up Johnson on the eve of the big-budget Hollywood Hulk to re-market this past treasure.  It's just too bad 'ole White Eyes himself couldn't have been there to share some of the banter with Johnson.
&quot;Within each of us, oftimes; there dwells a mighty and raging fury&quot;.<br />Thanks to the success of the HULK movie, the premiere of the original TV series has been released to DVD. Personally, I like the TV show better. I hadn't seen it since I was a little kid, and was surprised to find I enjoyed this DVD a lot.<br />The first episode on this is the series 1  pilot. As all fans of the show know, Bill Bixby plays Dr. David Banner; who is haunted by nightmares about the death of his wife Laura in a car accident after a tyre blows out and the car goes off the road. Banner escapes but is unable free Laura before the car explodes.<br />Later, Banner is conducting research for an experiment on superhuman strength. Interviewed is a woman recounting how she saved her son from burning to death in a car accident that is startlingly similar to Banner's own experience. After hearing more testimony, Banner seems to be the only one who has failed. Guilt and anxiety lead him to go one step further and become a guinea pig for his testing. He discovers that the source of this strength is gamma radiation, so he subjects himself to a course of it, but has no results. So he tries again- only this time exposing himself to seven times the amount. Nothing happens. At least... not immediately.<br />Matters come to a head when Banner, frustrated at his lack of progress is driving home in a thunderstorm and has to change a flat tyre in the rain; this combined stress leads to his first &quot;Hulk-out&quot;...<p>More intelligent than most TV movies, the pilot also has a memorable sequene paying homage to the drowning scene in James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN, where the Hulk tries to save a little girl from drowning but her screams alert her father who tries to shoot the hulk. Naturally the bullets just bounce off. Special mention must be made of the wig Lou Ferrigno wears- he looks like he should have a golf tee tacked into the top of his head. Also of note: Banner watches himself changing back through the reflection in the water. Strange considering in the 1990 TVM, DEATH OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK Banner comments he's never before seen the creature after watching a tape of his transformation!<br />The bonus episode on the DVD is the series 2 pilot &quot;Married&quot;; again Written, Produced and Directed by Kenneth Johnson, who also produced SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and BIONIC WOMAN.<br />This installment has Banner, using the alias David Benton; in Honolulu seeing psychiatrist Dr. Caroline Fields (Mariette Hartley, in an Emmy winning performance) to try and control his &quot;hulkouts&quot;.(He even shows her a newspaper photo of the Hulk and confronts the beast while under hypnosis! So that's three times on this DVD alone!) Banner falls in love with her and learns Caroline is terminally ill and has only 6-8 weeks to live. Of course, Banner is none too happy to discover his nemesis, tabloid reporter Jack Magee (Jack Colvin) is sniffing around trying to catch the creature.<br />MARRIED is an intelligent emotionally charged, (but not sappy) episode which is appealing to adults as well as kids. There are also a few laughs, most notably in the scene where the Hulk trashes a weasly bachelor's &quot;swinging&quot; pad! The bell bottoms are good for a giggle too. &quot;Groovy&quot; stuff. I hope more episodes of the show are released on DVD.
One word - EXCELLENT! <p>This TV series was hands down, the best transformation of a comic book character to the screen. From the opening credits of the pilot, we could immediately tell that we were in for a quality production. Everything about it is excellent: the story, the actors, the direction, the music. Sure, it does have some elements of "70's cheesiness," but for the most part, it is a timeless production. The same is also true for the bonus episode "Married."<p>Without getting too much into the show itself, these two episodes were a great choice for this DVD. Both stories are very tragic and sad and it almost seems like they are trying to show how much better the original series was than the new film! <p>As for the DVD, the picture is outstanding! It is very crisp and clean considering how old the footage is. Same thing with the audio. It brings this 25 year old show back to life!<p>The commentary by Kenneth Johnson is worth the price of the DVD alone! The show was basically Kenneth's baby; he wrote, produced, and directed it. In the commentary it is just him, talking about everything from the camera shots to the tragic life of Bill Bixby. I couldn't believe he went on for almost 4 hours without ever running out of things to talk about! Needless to say, it was fascinating. The intro by Lou Ferrigno is also a nice extra. <p>There are a couple of annoying things about the DVD, mainly the fact that most of the extras have nothing to do with the original show! Even the cover is from the new film (except for a barely noticable photo of Bill and Lou in the CGI Hulk's hand.) It becomes painfully obvious that this DVD was released mainly to promote the new film, which makes me pessimistic about any season sets in the near future. <p>And the most annoying thing of all - they make you sit through a preview of "The Fast and Furious" DVD every time you want to watch the pilot!!! There should be a law against this.<p>The strengths of this DVD far outshine the weaknesses, which is why I give it 5 stars!
I remember watching this episode (and its sequel) back in 1977 on CBS.  I had the feeling then it would make a nice series.  So when I heard after an episode of Wonder Woman that it would be a series, I made plans to watch.  Overall it was a great series, in fact the other episode on this disc won an emmy for its only major guest star Marriette Hartley (who would later work with Bixby again in Goodnight Beantown).  Anyway to get back to the pilot, it explored more of a human interest story in the character.  The writer apparantly felt that the death of Banner's wife would impact the viewer more than Banner saving a teenager from a bomb blast.  It's also interesting how they changed the character's name to David.  When the comic strip started he was called Bruce Banner.  Then Stan Lee slipped a few times and called him Bob Banner in occasional strips which to remedy, he copped a plea by saying his name was really Robert Bruce Banner.  And now he's David.  Since they (Universal) couldn't remedy it without recutting the film, Stan Lee himself convinced the studio to use his cop out to explain the name change which is why his name at the cemetary is David Bruce Banner.  Good thing they left well enough alone at this point.  I just hope in the new movie, they don't change his name again or I'm heading for the hills.  But seriously this disc and the series sequels (also on DVD now) are worth buying.  By the way, if you think this postive review overrides my review of the 2fer, you're wrong.  I only rated that 1 star because they should have put all 3 sequels in 1 set. Buy this disc and buy the others too. :-)
The movie displayed on my 61&quot; projection screen TV with a sharpness &amp; clarity I haven't seen since I watched the originals as a kid. I surmise they must have duplicated this from a very clean print.<p>It pretty much blows the awful, muddy, pan-and-scan VHS version away from a quality standpoint, and the clarity of this DVD version will MARKEDLY increase your viewing pleasure.<p>The bonus features are kinda neat, if not fluff, but certainly for the movie buff, you'll enjoy the director's commentary and value adds the DVD contains.<p>If you liked this series, and are ready to reintroduce yourself to a sci-fi classic, BUY THIS DVD TODAY!
I have been patiently waiting for nearly a year for them to pay some homage and props to the tv show (to coincide with the movie in Jun).  I grew up being scared out of my wits as a kid of the Hulk when I regularly watched the show and the reruns that came on (which is were I saw a majority of the episodes). I am glad they are planning on releasing the pilot and a reg two parter episode on DVD.  I can't wait to get this DVD and I do hope they plan on putting some future episodes on DVD or perhaps putting Season 1 or Season 2 on a future DVD release.
With the upcoming theatrical release of "The Incredible Hulk", it's obvious that Universal is trying to cash in on the popularity of the big green guy by reissuing the pilot from the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno show.<p>Taking its inspiration not only from the Marvel comic but the 60's classic "The Fugitive", the show ran from five seasons, from 1978 - 1982, with two pilot films initially in 1977 and three subsequent "reunion" films from 1988 - 1990. <p>Bill Bixby plays Dr. David Banner, a scientist searching for understanding to the workings of the adrenaline gland and man's hidden inner strength that seems to arise in times of stress. During a "dark and stormy night", the doctor exposes himself to massive doses of gamma radiation with little effect...or so he thinks. Later that evening, while driving from the laboratory, Banner's car has a flat tire. Enraged at having to change in the torrential downpour, Banner's anger gets the best of him and he ERUPTS into our friendly "jolly green giant", played by AH-nold's one time competition, Lou Ferrigno.<p>The remainder of the movie finds Banner trying to better understand his condition while eluding the hounding from an investigative reporter (Jack Colvin) intent on discovery the identity of the "monster" and the connection with Banner. Also appearing is Susan Sullivan, fresh from the soap opera "Another World" and before she traveled to wine country in primetime's "Falcon Crest".<p>Joe Yarnell provides the subtle yet effective score, heavy with a very poignant piano. <p>Kenneth Johnson, who would later score big with the miniseries "V", is the director, and makes a fanciful tale quite believable.
If you are a Hulk fan don't let the age of this TV movie fool you. It's a more true portrayal of the Hulk character.  Without the CGI and modern film effects it still holds up as a classic Man vs Monster story.  The second film "Married" or Bride of the Hulk works the same type of story only the Hulk is trying to rescue a young lady who is being abused by her family to collect insurance money. All in all these films are the better of the modern version.  While the special effects got me to go to the theater this version stands the test of time.
When I saw the pilot episode I really hated it. I don't remeber why I hated it but now I love it!!!!! It's about a man named David Banner(Bill Bixby) who's wife died in a car acident. Angry that he was not able to save his wife, he finds out that the same thing has been happing to other people, only they saved the person in the person car. David finds out that it is the gamma energy that is helping the other people save the person in the car. David put gamma energy into his body, but so much that it made this creature called the Hulk( Lou Freggino). Great start to a great series. Better than the movie. This DVD has another episode called &quot;Marride&quot; which is very good and has lots of Hulk sceans. Well worth your money.
