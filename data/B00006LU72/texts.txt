ALot of the footage that is discernable is not from Master Soken but from some other guy.<br /><br />There is some footage of the Hakutusuru(or so the narrator Claims) but it was very short.<br /><br />The peices of the weaponry/kata performed by Master Soken are excellent.<br /><br />I reccomend it only if you have the extra $$ to throw around , it isn't all that great but is ok for the enthusiast<br /><br />PS(The narrator becomes quite irratating)
I was very excited to get this dvd, as an avid practioner of Shorin-Ryu.  However, the dvd left a lot to be desired.  There is very lot footage of Soken, and the majority of the footage that is shown can be found on youtube for free.  I think that this was just a sad attempt of George Alexander attempting to make money again.  I would not waste your money, just search for Master Soken on youtube and you will have everything that this dvd has to offer.
