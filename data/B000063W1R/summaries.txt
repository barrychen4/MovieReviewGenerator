Excellent -- a "must see"!
Watchable, but not satisfying
Speedy delivery
One of the
The Count of Monte Cristo
James C. and the Count
WOW!
A Good Film, But the Book Was Better!
An entertaining swashbuckler
Very enjoyable for men and women....
Um .. ok but?? READ THE BOOK FIRST.
Excellent movie!!! Go watch it!!!
If it Ain't Broke.........
Read the Book, Seen the Movie
Excellent Movie
Superb
Just like the book, except for the whole concept thing
Swashbuckling intensity that never lets up
A very weak adaption of the novel
We Are All Either Kings Or Pawns In The Game Of Life
Good movie, mediocre Action movie.
A good movie to see
Entertaining and fun...
Ain't payback a- well, you know...
BREATHTAKING...THEY JUST DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE
A butchery of the book
They didn't  read the novel before they wrote this BOMB!!!
Internal Strength encompassed in a "guys" movie
Another example of why books should not be made into movies
Critics are wrong
wrong area
count of Monte cristo
Dysfunctional DVD
Deplorable Adaptation
The Count of Hollywood
Hopefully you will get a good disc
Good..But please don't call it "Faithful"
Great Book by Dumas, horrible movie.
A good effort, but ultimately cheesy and unlike the novel
did they even read the book?
Revenge can kill you, yet it's what kept him alive...
a true product of Hollywood
Dumbed-down and gloomy
Not A Great Re-Make!
They've trashed yet another masterpiece
Good movie but,
A fine adaption of the Dumas classic
Its not like the book
Love this Film
Weak retelling of classic story
At last...a romantic movie without the dirty smut
Good Adaption Of Revenge Classic
Old-Fashioned Movie Fun!
The Count gets my vote for outstanding Picture of the Year!
Revenge is God's Justice....but he is in charge
Good cast and scenery don't make up for a story so far removed from Mr Dumas' incredible book
This is what happens when you cram a classic into a matinee
This Counts as a Classic
Classic Score!
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
a great movie
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
Blu-Ray DVD - The Count of Monte Cristo
Hollywoodian ending at its worst
Somewhat boring
I couldn't stop watching
An entertaining time in revolutionary France.
This movie rocks!!
intriguing classic tale of betrayal, injustice, and revenge
I LOVED this movie!!!
Lovely
Absolutely Stellar..
This movie was amazing
The film that has everything
Don't buy if you live in America
region two
The actor playing the Count isn't up to the job
This DVD SKIPPED FREQUENTLY
Completely misses the point!
a wrong casting job, further ruined by a lame screenplay
The Count of Monte Cristo
Visually a treat
Never Read the Book .......
Some interesting twists on the Alexander Dumas classic
Amazing movie with an exceptional plot and great twists
If you liked the book...DON'T SEE THIS
High ratings for main and supporting character
***Flawed DVD!***
Ehhhh, It's Ok.
Throw it in the dungeon
Great Movie
Generic Hollywood Rubish
Second time to return Disk
A VERY abridged and altered Count of Monte Cristo!
decent, but not even close
Utter crap
Pan & Scan... Forget it!!!
Luis Guzman is in this one!
a good movie but a horrible adaptation
AMAZING!!
Stupendous!!!!!
Unbelievably dull
Wow!
Blu-ray: The Count of Monte Cristo" is exciting, entertaining and a clever revenge film worth watching!
One of my very favorite movies
Loved the book, Loved the movie!
"I don't believe in God!" "Doesn't matter...he believes in you."
Enjoyable For Those Who Never Read the Book
Such an underrated movie!!
More satisfying for an old man.

You Can Count On Revenge
Why does everyone hate this film?
What I like about this movie
A Classic Rush From a Classic Action Film
Pleasantly Surprised
What's better than a hot guy getting revenge?
Excellent movie
Good but not great
Tremendously entertaining!
Don't judge a book by its movie
Fun is had by all.
Two hours of totally escapist entertainment!
Disappointed
