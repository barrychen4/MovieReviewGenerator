A Cartoon Creature Feasts On A Bounty Of Idiotic Characters Who Don't Have The Sense To Come In From The Cold
Oh, the good old days
Too cheesey for its own good
SILLIEST LOOKING MONSTER IN YEARS
A scy/fy channel like movie that was actually not that bad. Not offensive or that good just OK. Ending was awful. I say C+
A well-acted,nicely paced film. I really liked it!
Hypothermia rocks!!!
Visually Masterful Underground Cinema
