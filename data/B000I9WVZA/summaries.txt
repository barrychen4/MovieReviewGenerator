Watch out for this director
An interesting peek at the secrets friends keep
This movie pushes you to your ethical limits!
I can see both sides.
I expected more comedy and less gore
TO SEE WITH NO PREJUDICES
The funniest black comedy since Pink Flamingoes.
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; meets &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; .... in better !
Very Bad Things

Comedy of the Absurd
DISTURBING BUT GREAT

A wild, thrilling savory (acquired) taste

A good Hollywood film
Peter directs a dark comedy that begins good then runs out
Call it a guilty pleasure

A Supreme Example of Black Comedy
Very Dark Humor
&quot;Controversial&quot; in some very cheap ways...
A Very Bad Thing

Addictively Sick and Definately Insane
technically excellent, but left a bad taste
