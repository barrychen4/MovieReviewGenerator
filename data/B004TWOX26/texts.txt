Beethoven Symphonies Nos. 4 & 7, Coriolan Overture<br />Vladimir Jurowski, conductor<br />Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment<br />Theatre des Champs-Elysees<br />EuroArts Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />In my opinion, this disc illustrates once again why Maestro Jurowski is earning a reputation as one of the premier orchestra and opera conductors of today.<br /><br />The three Beethoven works performed on this disc are examples of classical music-making at its very best, with tempos and dynamic shadings that are spot on.  In addition, the use of period instruments and a small-scaled orchestra provide listeners a clarity of detail, textures, colors, and harmonies that are quite beautiful.<br /><br />Noteworthy also are those occasional passages where the tympani and/or horns are featured.  In these particular passages, these accent instruments are heard to better advantage than one normally encounters, and the effect is impressive.  And finally it should be pointed out that the introduction (and subsequent playings) of the main theme of the last movement of the 7th symphony are truly wonderful.  This is primarily due to the violinists use of a style of bowing known as (I think) "spiccato"---a bowing technique that gives the music a bit more "bite" and definition than one usually hears.  To me, hearing the theme played this way is exactly the way it was meant to be heard.<br /><br />Both the picture and sound quality of this Blu-ray disc are excellent.
From the very first bars of the Coriolan Overture, it is apparent that this is Beethoven at his very best. Vladimir Jurowski and his absolutely brilliant Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment give us a new reading of old favorites that may well blow you out of your chair. There is plenty to discover: sounds and textures never heard before, an orchestral timbre as the composer himself may have envisaged and heard, incredible strength and cohesion and, on the other hand, sensitive nuances that often disappear under a blanket of massed strings in more traditional interpretations. Listen to the period woodwinds, the valveless trumpets and horns, the timpani actually striking the music's beat! Enough. As the interpretations go, all three are glorious and fully in tune with the respective works. In the symphonies, Jurowski lovingly takes his time with the first two movements to press on rather relentlessly in the final movements. Believe me: it works. Sound and video of the 2010 recording are great and the Paris audience in the beautiful Th&eacute;atre des Champs-Elys&eacute;es is rightly bowled over. Do not miss this disk.
This is a sharply etched set of Beethoven works as played by an orchestra using instruments typical of Beethoven's period under the firm and disciplined direction of the young Russian conductor Vladimir Jurowski.<br /><br />Many will associate Jurowski with successful performances of opera where there is generally a strong dramatic impulse to the interpretations, frequently up-tempo choices of speeds and generally tight control. This often leads to exciting results within the theatre world. The question therefore must be, how does he fare in standard concert works such as these?<br /><br />In my opinion he does very well indeed and along expected lines. The concert starts with a grippingly taut performance of the Coriolan Overture. This is followed by an equally tight and dramatic account of the 4th symphony with sharp articulation from the orchestra at generally crisp speeds. Drama is accentuated by prominent timpani with hard sticks and cuttingly forceful brass. This is not a comfortable concept, but Beethoven himself was not a comfortable character either.<br /><br />The concert concludes with a strikingly dramatic performance of the popular 7th symphony that follows all the previous characteristics with the exception of the speed chosen for the last movement. This `apotheosis of the dance' is taken at a relatively steady speed which, on first hearing, came as rather a disappointment to me - but definitely not to the rapturous audience. However upon further hearing it became clear that the chosen speed, which was adhered to with remarkable consistency, was exactly right in enabling the vital concluding bars with blaring horns to truly hit home with precise articulation and power - the overwhelming effect that Beethoven surely had in mind at the time of writing.<br /><br />So for me this is a very fine and convincing disc of `period' Beethoven performances. Taken on its own terms it is probably unlikely to be bettered in terms of drama, accuracy of performance and period style. It is certainly a far cry from the alternative viewpoint taken by Thielemann with the VPO for example. There should perhaps be room for both concepts.<br /><br />The recording is exceptionally fine in so far as the sound fully captures the energetic `rawness' of the intended sound. This is backed up by dramatically sympathetic camera work that manages to be detailed without being invasive.<br /><br />In my opinion therefore, this warrants the full 5 stars. However, if you like Beethoven to be big and sumptuous you may not like it and would be best advised to search elsewhere for musical satisfaction.
There are of course numerous authoritative readings of the pieces recorded in this DVD.<br />The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, however, is a period instrumental ensemble.  There are some people who adamantly refuses to accept any 'period' performance of Beethoven's grand symphonies.<br />I approachded this disc with reservation myself, but the performance as recorded quickly dispelled any of my remaining concern.<br />The recorded sound is very good.  I first played the disc without viewing, and was rapturous of the accoustics, and much more so as I listened further by the performance.<br />Jurowski has a good credential as an opera conductor.  He is in charge currently of the Glyndebourne Festival, and has conducted at Italy, Germany, USA, and at large opera houses, even the MET, all to critical acclaim.<br />Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this musician's strength lies not only in opera.  The wonderful pianist Sviastoslav Richter began his pianistic career doing piano rehearsals for opera houses.  Nobody termed the legendary Richter an 'opera pianist'.  What is in the operas, often goes into a composer's instrumental music, W A Mozart is a clear example to boot.<br />The conducting of Jurowski is clearly dramatic, but at the same time totally idiomatic. You will not find a Beethoven that is like Wagner. Having watched him live, Vladimir is clearly one of those 'conducting before the music' conductors.<br />For young conducting talents, the No. 7 Symphony here reminds me of Guido Cantelli's own stereo recording of this masterpiece, a performance that is totally youthful and energised.  Jurowski and the OAE comes really close to that legendary reading.
Where to begin? My friend Gerhard Knapp loves this disc (see his review).Usually we see eye to eye. In this case, I'm afraid we'll have to agree to disagree! I've listened to it several times, but I can't warm to it.<br /><br />Let me say that my own preference for Beethoven is big-band sumptuous sound. I like the Thielemann/Vienna Phil. set. I'm not fond of the scratchy, honky sounds that emanate from these "original instruments". Sir Thomas Beecham once famously pronounced that they sounded like cats copulating on a tin roof. I wouldn't go that far, but I do think you have to play the music swiftly if you're going to minimize the unprettiness of these old instruments. Jurowski plays these symphonies way too slowly, especially the fast movements, so you get a lot of unusual, and for me, unwelcome noises coming through.<br /><br />It is often said that this is how Beethoven heard his music. First of all, his deafness prevented him hearing much of anything, but I'm convinced that had he been able to appreciate today's much improved instruments and more skillful players, he would have much preferred this later sound.<br /><br />If you like your Beethoven small, quick and lean, try to hear the Paavo Jarvi set with his Bremen orchestra on Sony DVD.His attack and phrasing are something to behold. Sadly not available from Amazon in the U.S.A,you can get it from "import cds" in California, amongst other sources. These are as exciting as any you'll ever hear, and contain the "wickedest" Beethoven #7 I've ever heard! Even a large orchestra guy like me can love this set!<br /><br />So this Jurowski for me was disappointing, but others may like it better. My advice is get the Jarvi set. It really is remarkable.
