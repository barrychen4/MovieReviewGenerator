Older version, but the DVD is in perfect condition as is the case, which isn't at the top of my priority list. A wonderful movie and the quality of the DVD is just as I hoped.
how can you not love Mary Poppins!  We went to the Broadway play and then bought the DVD.  My kids love it!
First, I was thrilled to learn that I could rent Mary Poppins from amazon. My 5-year-old grandson wanted to see it (I had told him my sister and I had seen it when we were young multiple times). I'd gone to two local libraries, to no avail. So, for almost nothing, Christian and I rented Mary Poppins and had a supercalifragilistically good time!! Thanks amazon.
My 3-year old grandson loves this movie and my daughter feels good about letting him watch something with no violence and good values.
What to say? This is the best Disney DVD ever. It's Magic. Just plain MAGIC. There are two discs. One of the movie. Another of special features. If you have never seen this Walt Disney masterpiece, it is a supreme treat. If you have, then you know. Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Ed Wynn, David Tomlinson, Elsa Lanchester. INSPIRED. METICULOUS. ENTERTAINING. It's the tale of a special Nanny and a chimney sweep named Bert in London, England in the year 1910. Something about her elicits wonderful things, and she and her cohorts create marvelous film fun and fantasy the likes of which you'll never forget. Lively dance animation, too. Vivid colours. Great music. Unbelievable special effects. Do you like Dancing Penguins? I do. You'll think you are a kid still. Richard Sherman and his brother composed the memorable film music. On Disc Two they take a wistful look back at the production in 1964. Both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke reveal their nostalgic, candid experiences of movie making on the Disney set. And Wow! The 1964 footage of the Gala World Premiere! This is a GEM, A CROWN JEWEL OF THE DISNEY VAULT. Watching both discs brought tears of joy to my eyes and surely it will bring broad smiles to yours. Winner of FIVE ACADEMY AWARDS: BEST ACTRESS, FILM EDITING, MUSIC SCORE, MUSIC SONG "Chim Chim Cher-ee," and SPECIAL VISUAL EFFECTS. A timeless tale about love and laughter created by the genius of Mr. Walt Disney.
If you have to read a review for Mary Poppins- have you been living under a rock?  truly a time honored classic, I hope my children get the enjoyment out of this that I did, growing up...
Who could not like mary poppins, the quality is just what it should be and my grandchildren loved it, wish there would have been a sequel
I had a terrible time trying to find this movie, which was a shock to me. Apparamtly most have seen it or don't care.It is, without a doubt, one of the best movies ever. Delightfuly entertaining.I am SO happy I found it on Amazon and for a good price, too ! This IS a classic that everyone should see and have.
"Mary Poppins" will always be memorable to me if for no other reason, (but there are others I assure you!), that this is the first film I ever got to see without an adult accompanying me.  I was all of ten and a half years old in February 1965 and had been anxiously waiting for the movie to come to our local theatre for months, it finally had!  I remember badgering my mother to let the friend from school who was sleeping over (another first) and I go see the movie alone.  Certainly I didn't want to appear a baby in front of my pal, who was already going to movies without adult supervision, or so he told me.  My mother reluctantly agreed, even letting us buy our own tickets at the booth, after ascertaining what time the film let out, and told us sternly to wait right under the theatre marquee if she wasn't right there when the movie let out until she arrived.  Different times, anyway my buddy and I both loved it, and there was another momentous stepping-stone on the path to being a "grown-up" for me.<br /><br />That piece of nostalgia aside, "Mary Poppins" is besides "The Wizard of Oz" and the other classic Disney Films, one of the most delightful fantasy films that can be enjoyed by both children and adults.  The character of Mary Poppins was introduced and developed by P.L. Travers in a quartet of children's books.  In adapting them to the screen the writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, skillfully choose several chapters out of the first two books and added their own inspired ideas.  The story is fairly simple, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) responds to an advertisement by youngsters Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) for "The Perfect Nanny" for themselves.  Although the Banks children live a very comfortable existence on Cherry Tree Lane in the heart of London, they are starved for some affectionate attention.  Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson) is too preoccupied with his role as a bank manager whereas Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) is a suffragette, fighting to get the vote for women.  Mary Poppins serenely sails in from the skies, and with her good friend the jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) they take the children on all sorts of wondrous adventures and nourish them with tenderness and love.  By the film's end the Banks are truly a happy family, thanks to Mary Poppins.<br /><br /> It's magical, in all senses of the word, and transcends the generations.  I recall that very first time my friend and I laughing in delight and looking at one another in awe as one illusion after another unfolded on the screen, how'd they do that anyway?  I felt I'd come full circle the first time I watched it with my son when he was three seeing the wonder reflected in his face and hearing him merrily chortle as Mary Poppins cast her spell yet again.<br /><br />"Practically perfect in every way" is how Mary Poppins is described, and I will borrow that phrase to characterize Julie Andrews' performance as Mary Poppins.  From her tip-tilted nose down to her feet spread out to form a "v" shape, she is the prettiest, most beguiling nanny you'll ever come across, sings gloriously and enchantingly makes the role her own.  Considered to be her consolation prize when she wasn't chosen to repeat her Broadway role in the film version of "My Fair Lady", she would have the last laugh come award time when she scooped not only the Golden Globe but Academy Award as Best Actress.  As Bert, Dick Van Dyke, lanky and rubber limbed is her ideal partner, they are simply wonderful together particularly in the "Jolly Holiday" sequence.  My wife and I thought when "Victor/Victoria" came to Broadway, Van Dyke should have played the late Robert Preston's role as Toddy to Julie Andrews' Victoria, it would have been a perfect reunion.  He also gets to show off his prowess as a dancer in the zany, athletic "Step in Time" number.  Child actors can be annoyingly arch and cutesy, but Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as Jane and Michael Banks are refreshingly natural and winning without any irritating mannerisms.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding and should take a collective bow, starting with Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson as the Banks, Ed Wynn as the effervescent Uncle Albert, Hermione Baddley, Reta Shaw, Reginald Owen, Elsa Lanchester, and Arthur Treacher down to Jane Darwell's tender Bird Woman.<br /><br />Other reasons to see this film, first, for their time extraordinary special effects that are all the more impressive since they were developed pre computer, deservedly rewarded with an Oscar.  To give you a sample, Mary Poppins, Bert and the children popping into a chalk pavement drawing into a magical animated world, a tea party on the ceiling, and the four walking up a black staircase to the sky composed of smoke.  Next a bright, tuneful score, the best ever done by the Sherman Brothers, including the Oscar winning Best Song "Chim Chim Cher-ee", "A Spoonful of Sugar"  "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", and "Feed the Birds".  This last was allegedly one of Walt Disney's favorite songs, and again this original score also took away an Academy Award.  The evocative sets of 1910 Edwardian London are perfectly executed particularly the Cherry Tree Lane set, and Tony Walton, the then husband of Julie Andrews designed costumes that a treat to the eye.  Again Oscar nominations for both, actually "Mary Poppins" received a record 13 Oscar nominations that also included Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Stevenson. One final tip of the hat to husband and wife choreographers, Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood for their exuberant dances particularly in the "Step in Time" number.<br /><br />The special features are a treasure trove of riches.  Here are the highlights: a fascinating commentary by Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, The Sherman Brothers and Karen Dotrice, "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins" -very well done indeed, a musical reunion with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman, the gala world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater, lots of fun to see the Hollywood A list circa 1964, a bonus animated short narrated by Julie Andrews called "The Cat that Looked at a King", and finally a song that was cut called "Chimpanzoo" performed by Richard Sherman.<br /><br />Last words, this restored print has state of the art picture and sound, with vivid, glowing colors and a clear, crisp soundtrack and score. I could go on and on, sufficient to say this was Walt Disney's live action film masterpiece, if you're never seen it before you're in for a joyous celebration, and if you have take the time to renew your acquaintance with this timeless classic.
I took my daughter when she was 5 to see this movie, her 1st movie, dressed her like Mary Poppins, and she was blown away, now she is 5o and she was again blown away when she recieved this from me on Christmas morning, many tears of joy!! a real joyful experience
My daughter is 3, and she loves Mary Poppins!  She sings along with all the songs.  It keeps her occupied for long car rides!
my toddler loves this film-especially the music...he recognizes the songs and actually sings along with them, even though he is not yet two and his speech is extremely limited. great child-friendly film
My 2 and a half year old grandson sits through the movie. He dances around during the seen where the carosel horses leave the marry go round. I wasn't sure he was old enough for the movie, but he is and he loves it.
Classic movie that never gets old.  I love Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke in this movie.  I wish I had had a Mary Poppins when I was a child!
While I loved it as a child, it never occured to me my 3 year old would also love it.  She fell in love with it at my parent's house and sang the songs she learned for weeks afterward.  She looked forward to watching it so much everytime she visited them that I had to pick her up her own copy for X-mas!
A different sort of review this, for it invites YOUR participation!<br /><br />Haven't seen MARY POPPINS since 1964, and finally watched it again yesterday. The colors on my VHS copy are vivid and the film's condition quite excellent throughout.<br /><br />Random impressions:<br />Seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful, and Dick Van Dyke without all the shaggy white hair, and Ed Wynn alive and giddy, was an absolute delight!<br /><br />There are SO many songs in this picture! It's practically an operetta.<br />The live action/animation sequences are quite clever.<br />That choreographed chimney sweep number is magnificent!<br />Dick Van Dyke is a helluva dancer, and Julie Andrews keeps right up with him.<br /><br />It's not mentioned in the closing credits that Van Dyke has a dual role: as Mary's friend Bert and Mr. Dawes, the elderly chairman of the bank board.<br /><br />Finally, an invitation to some shared speculation---<br /><br />What exactly IS Mary Poppins? Is she a witch or a spirit made carnate?<br />We initially meet her as she sits on a cloud, powdering her nose. Later, to better see her face she wants a larger wall mirror, then appears within it to sing a duet with and even outdo herself. A third looking glass moment occurs in the chimney sweep sequence-- Mary uses a compact to touch up her dirty face with more soot!<br /><br />Clearly, the young lady is vain. She "hmmph"s when her mirror image outsings her, so she's also jealous, and when she refuses to answer her employer's questions, it shows Mary to be headstrong.<br /><br />So, IS Miss Poppins "practically perfect"?

Our 'almost' 4 years old twins (boy and girl) LOVE this video.  It's very entertaining.  They have watched this movie 6 times since we bought it 2 weeks ago.  They are now singing some of the songs too.  I'm glad they finally have a favorite movie.  They don't like any other Disney movies that I bought since usually the mothers are killed (such as Nemo, Little Mermaid, The Fox & The Hound) or Dumbo (the mother being taken away).
I recently purchased this lovely movie for my 3-year-old son and it quickly became his favorite one. It does not matter how long ago it was made, Mary Poppins is a MUST HAVE in all homes with children and without children too, why not? It is simply fantastic and full of magic. We are Mexicans and I play it for him in Spanish and also in English, it is the best way for young ones to learn another language, it works for this purpose as well. Do not hesitate and get it!
This 40th edition of MARY POPPINS is worth it! Of course the movie is gloriously restored and stuff and is a must have for anyone who loved the book and the movie.<br /><br />The real prize is the second disc that features lots of extras like:<br /><br />***1:32-Minute = Deleted song with story board "Chimpanzoo"<br /><br />***17:20-Minute = Reunion with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, & songwriter Richard Sherman<br /><br />***20:50-Minute = Musical Journey w/Sherman explaining the process of writing the songs for MP with the Sherman brothers and includes some songs that weren't used in the movie<br /><br />***50:40-Minute = The Making Of Mary Poppins with Andrews, Van Dyke, Sherman and others from the cast like Glynis Johns (Mrs. Banks) and Karen Dotrice (Jane Banks) and others with audio recordings of suggestions from author P.L. Travers<br /><br />***7:05-Minute = Movie magic featurette explaining the special effects and set design + animatronics used in MP<br /><br />***13:00 & 4:50-Minutes Each = Deconstruction Of A Scene "Jolly Holiday" and "Step In Time" shows the composites of the live action shots plus the backgrounds for the two musical scenes<br /><br />***1:00-Minute = Dick Van Dyke Make-up Test<br /><br />***17:45-Minute = The Red Carpet Premiere from Grauman's Chinese Theater, with text intro explaining the television special of the event. Fun look at Hollywood in the swinging 60s with stars and glamour!<br /><br />***6:25-Minute = Premiere After Party in the parking lot of Grauman's. However, the audio is from a radio broadcast but the footage is really cleaned up and pristine for being shot on a 16mm camera.<br /><br />***9:35-Minute = Bonus Short "The Cat That Looked At A King" from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0152058222">Mary Poppins Opens the Door (Mary Poppins)</a> with Julie Andrews and Tracey Ullman as the voice of the cat. This was done recently and is an animated short where Andrews and two children watch the story after jumping into the picture (like in the movie MP).<br /><br />***Trailers, Still Gallery and a game<br /><br />All those goodies make this 40th edition of "Mary Poppins" worth buying!
I have numerous happy memories of seeing Mary Poppins since the first time (on its re-release in 1980). I go back to it time and again and have never been bored yet!  Highlights - the horse race and the dancing cartoon waiter penguins; Chim Chim Chiree and the acrobatic chimney sweeps; Mrs Banks (Glynis Johns) and her 'Votes for Women'; Reginald Owen's Admiral (with a ship on the roof of his house!); the gorgeous 'Feed the Birds'; the special effects in 'A Spoonful of Sugar'; Ed Wynn as the giggling Uncle Albert; and of course the brilliant performances from Julie Andrews as Mary, Dick van Dyke as Bert/Mr Dawes senior, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as the children Jane and Michael, Hermoine Baddeley as the maid, and David Tomlinson as Mr Banks.  Absolutely brilliant and definitely makes you remember being a child with a big smile on your face. Those who don't like it possibly came to it too late in life, but I can't fault it.
I bought this for my 5 year-old daughter as a Christmas present.  It has been remastered, and the visual and audio upgrades are great.  A wonderful addition to any Disney video collection.
I love this movie from when I was a little kid,  so I have bought it so my children can enjoy it two.
I loved Mary Poppins when I was young, my daughter was absolutely taken with it when she was 2, and now my granddaughter watches it at least three times a day.  This movie is magical classic.
As a product of 60's Disney films, I purchased the DVD after my 8 year old son and 11 year old daughter went to see the Broadway production of "Mary Poppins".  The kids started watching it immediately and I loved listening to them sing my favorite songs from the movie.  Ten days later on a rainy Sunday we popped it in the DVD player as a family and watched it on the big HDTV in the living room.<br /><br />I was amazed at the color, the skin tones and the digital remix of the score.  I felt just as excited as the first time I saw it,  was shocked at Dick Van Dyke's blue eyes, the creamy complexion of Julie Andrews and the sheer fun of this movie.<br /><br />And my technie kids loved the story - "T'uPence never fails to make them sad about the pigeons at St. Mark's Square and I love that as a mother I'm sharing some of my own childhood.<br /><br />PS - my son wants to be a chimney sweep!
This movie is just amazing. I feel everybody should watch this film, IN FACT i just sat down with my friend who had not watched it a few months ago and made her! If you like this movie, I would also recommend "the sound of music".<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04OM">The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>
I loved this movie as a child.  Now mine loves it as well.  Great movie!
My three year old boy loves this movie. What is not to love about Mary Poppins?  The dancing, the singing, he loves it.  I found the movie very entertaining to watch.  There is also a pop up feature so you can read about interesting facts about the making of the movie, the characters, etc.  That is very interesting. There are some tidbits about Walt Disney's participation.  There are two DVDs and I've yet to see what is on disc 2. I highly recommend.
This was a Christmas gift, so thank you for the quick delivery and excellent condition. Merry Christmas!
Purchase your copy of Mary Poppins before it goes in the Disney vault!  This is a beautiful classic that young children will watch over and over again.  When my youngest was in the hospital years ago, I used to sing him the songs from the movie as his IVs were being put in and it was the only thing that would soothe him.  Highly recommend it for boys and girls 2 years old and up.
This product was sent in a timely fashion and I was very pleased with its quality.
Disney's Mary Poppins is an amazing movie. Back in its day, no one had ever really seen animated characters dancing alongside real humans, and Disney made this possible. Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, making it a Disney Classic, and for many years to come. This movie is excellent for the young, and young at heart. The tunes get your feet tapping and you sing the songs, and when it's over, you want to watch it all over again(or buy the CD)! This is a great movie for the whole family, brought to you by Disney.
I don't need to mention anything about this movie. If you are reading this, you already know this is a great movie. All I can say is that my whole family enjoyed watching this movie again.<br /><br />The extras are excellent. Though, the Mary Poppins "short movie" was average. I did enjoy seeing the red carpet arrivals when it was first released as well as a much older Dick Van Dyke trying to dance to the movie's signature tune.<br /><br />If you do not own Mary Poppins on DVD, you should immediately buy this.
it's perfect... i've always wanted to have this dvd!<br />thank you!<br /><br />hey! i'm looking for yentl and fantasia too.... is you have it would you please let me know?!<br /><br />thanks again!
Mary Poppins, what else needs to be said.  My children, who claim to be too cool for this old film, thoroughly enjoyed it.
There can be no better way than bring brightness to life than watching Disney's Mary Poppins.  The cast could not have been selected better and the music is enchanting (sing along words are included in this dvd) The story takes us back to glory days of the Empire and is a great lesson about kindness and empathy.  Great as a family film or for anyone.<br />This particular dvd set has excellent colour and clarity.  A must purchase for anyone who loves musicals.
I needed this movie asap for a friend and her children before they moved.  It arrived when you said it would.  The 40th anniv edition is wonderful--according to my friend!
Awesome buy it today. You can't go wrong. It is more suited for 8 plus year olds. Enjoy the music is awesome and there is still taught manners and respect which is hard to find these days in children's viedoes.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VEPRQ">Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)</a><br /><br />To see a nanny in arrival by flying on the clouds!!!
Delivery was super fast. I think I had the DVD within 3 days of e-mailing the order. It will be a film that we will share with our grandchildren.
Great and wonderful movie.  My friend loves it and was excited to receive it as a gift.
Disney's triumph expertly blends live-action and animation, and boasts a delightful score by the Sherman Brothers, including "A Spoonful Of Sugar", "Chim-Chim-Cher-ee", and "Feed The Birds". Veteran troupers Ed Wynn, Reginald Owen and Arthur Treacher lend colorful support, and Van Dyke is an appealing song and dance man, though his Cockney accent fails him. The real draw of course is the irresistible Andrews, who won the Oscar in her first starring role. Best for younger children, and young-at-heart parents.
a classic.. nice to hear the kids sing these classic tunes watching it!!!
I hang out with my brother because no one likes us, and sometimes we stay up all night and analyze movies. As usual, he's right. Nearly all successful childrens films, books, etc...have something to do with the supra-natural. Witchcraft usually. Mary Poppins is the nicest witch ever. She crafts order from chaos, turns brats into nice children, and turns real life into a happy cartoon. The songs are ageless, timeless, and charming. Mary Poppins is a very powerful witch indeed! I'm sure that children will be spellbound and unable to unglue thier little eyes from the screen. For older people like me, I am way impressed by the seamless special effect; for example, Mary's carpet bag that's deep enough to hold a 7' lamp, other furnishings too, but her bag is only about 14" deep. I think it would have made a good series watching Mary go from house to house in ancient England rescuing needy families. Engaging and lovely. A truly wonderful film!
loved watching it with my daughter. She is eight...she is still walking around singing the songs and we watched it weeks ago!Great family entertainment!
A film by Robert Stevenson<p>"Mary Poppins" is one of the most beloved movies of all time, and for good reason.  This truly is a magical film.  It is a mixture of live action and animation and is a wonderful musical and is quite possibly the perfect family film.  Nominated for 13 Academy Awards and it was the winner of 5, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews in her feature film debut.  <p>"Mary Poppins" is the story of, well, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews).  Mary Poppins is the new nanny for Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Matthew (Michael Garber) Banks.  As a nanny, Mary Poppins is "practically perfect".  She floats down from the sky holding on to an umbrella and convinces George Banks (David Tomlinson) to give her the job as the nanny.  George is flustered by Mary and of course he gives her the job.  The lives and experiences of the children are about to change because there is something magical about Mary.  With a song and a dance amazing things happen around Mary.  She can clean up a room with nothing more than a snap of the fingers and can take a journey into a picture drawn with chalk on a sidewalk.  <p>"Mary Poppins" perfectly mixes animation (the penguin waiters!) and live action to create a magical world that is an incredible change from the London that Jane and Matthew think they know.  There are excellent acting performances and the over the top Dick Van Dyke is charming in how sweet he is.  The whole movie is sweet, charming, funny, and fantastic.  This is a highly recommended musical for the whole family
I think this movie is terrific,and there is not a thing wrong with it.Julie Andrews well deserved her Oscar, and I think Dick Van Dyke should have got one too.The songs are mesmorizing, and all the actors did a wonderful job. I'd have to say my two favorite songs are "Chim-Chimnie", and "Feed the Birds". It's in my top 4 Disney movies of all time.With 101 Dalmatians, Pinochio,and Peter Pan. "Mary Poppins" is terrific, and a movie the whole family should enjoy.
This film is one of the best Walt Disney ever made!! I have a twenty month old daughter and even she stops to watch "Mary Poppins"!! I even sing "A Spoonful of Sugar" while I clean house!! It is hands down a brilliant piece of cinematic history! You can't go wrong with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke!
This is a great film for any kid and a complete dream come true to have a baby sitter this fun Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke team up together and they seem to have a great time together entertaining the kids and I love to see Julie with her umberella a good friend have gave me a figurine of her holding her umbrella I really did like this movie it is witty, fun, enchanting, and entertaining!!!!!!
Most parents today would take a movie like this, pop it into the player, and let the kids immerse themselves in the enchanting adventure Mary Poppins brings with her, while they go and do what they need to do. But in reality, the parents are the ones that should watch it because underneath the world of carousel horses coming to life and tea parties on the ceiling and &quot;Chim Chim Cheree&quot; there is a very important lesson: you should never be too busy for your kids. Both parents, not just the father, were too invloved in their own things..whether it be Mr. Banks' postition at the bank or Mrs. Banks' crusade for women's rights. Mary, like the nannies before, was basically hired to do the parents' job. There are plenty of instances where the parents prove that they know nothing about their kids. I won't give away the ending, but the parent viewers would definitely be reminded that their kids grow up too fast and that there's no substitute for the love of a mother and father.
I love the way she introduces herself and i love her confidence.She will not be dominated by anyone and in this magical story Mary Poppins is the greatest childrens character ever.<br />Dame Julie Andrews IS Mary Poppins, and i thinks its marvellous how Mary runs rings round the stubburn Mr Banks.<br />What i was surprised to hear was that when P.L.Travers (the author of the Mary Poppins Book) viewed Ms. Andrews performance she classed it "satisfactory." Don't you have eyes you stupid woman! Without Julie's outstanding performance, your character would be boring, nasty and ugly like she was in your books. Although i have to agree with her on Dick Van Dykes performance as she wanted to re cast the character of Bert as she thouht he was nothing like her Bert in her books, she's right.<br />But really, this movie is a CLASSIC and has hardly any faults.  Though did you know that Glynis Johns (Mrs Banks) first thought Walt Disney was to cast her as Mary Poppins and when he told her that was already cast to THE Julie Andrews, she was angry and so only agreed to do the picture if she had a song as she felt Julie Andrews was taking all the songs in the picture, well theres only one thing to say to that and that is JULIE CAN SING, YOU CAN'T!!!!<br />The DVD has a wonderful little extra of the actual premiere of Mary Poppins which i found very interesting and also gives you a little featurette on the actual special effects. The picture is crisp and clear and the colour is vivid.<br />So Spit Spot! Buy this DVD to keep Mary Poppins looking "practically perfect in every way" forever!
1964: Julie Andrews was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress in her performance as Mary Poppins. British-born Julie Andrews was an accomplished singer on the American musical stage, as well as a gifted actress who would later appear in such films as The Sound Of Music and Victor/Victoria. She is most known for her work in this film. To many, it is the zenith of her career; certainly it launched her career. The Disney film was based on the British novelist P.L. Traver's books "Mary Poppins" and its sequel"Mary Poppins Comes Back". <p>George Banks (David Tomlinson), is the typical Victorian husband who works at a prestigious bank in downtown London, whose wife Winnifred (Glynis Johns) is an active feminist, whose children, Jane and Michael have successfully rid themselves of various nannies through their mischief. When the magical Mary Poppins comes into their lives, she transforms their lives through magical going ons (becoming part of a painting, having tea in the air) and brings happiness and remedy to the home that badly needs the affectionate attention of the overworked, uptight father.<p>The Oscar for Julie Andrews as best actress was well deserved. Her prudish, sugary image as the "practically perfect" nanny could not have been if not for Mary Poppins. The musical, for this is a musical (which unfortunately never became a Broadway musical) contains lots of upbeat and memorable songs, tinged at times with a melancholy sentiment- "Feed the Birds" and "Chim-Chimeney" the latter which won Best Song, "A Spoonful of Sugar" and the hilarious "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".<br />A family-oriented film, but suited for child-at-heart adults and musical lovers, this film is perfect entertainment for everyone.
Absoloutly innocent and adorable fun that the whole family will love. With the cartoons, jokes and classic songs, this is a film that kids to great grandparents can watch and enjoy equally.<p>There is so many great and important lessons too in the film. One such lesson is in the song "feed the birds" which teaches the importance of caring for all living things. Personally I get a warm and "in touch with Earth" feeling when I feed a deer, duck, etc, etc... Another great lesson comes from Burts job as a chimney sweep. As he and the children look out through the rooftop view of the city, burt tells the children how only the birds, planes and chimney sweeps get to see this view everyday. Its an important lesson to see the bright side of things even in the worst of situations. That is only a few of the great messages this movie delivers. <p>Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are amazing in Mary Poppins and show great chemistry. You can really tell how much love they put into this masterpiece.<br />  The DVD quality is amazing. Im a bit dissapointed that there is no extra cartoons with this one, but the movie is more then enough fun.
I really can't add anything unique in terms of superlative descriptions (a wonderful marriage of live action cinematography and animation; great songs and lyrics; top-notch story adaptation), so I'll just concentrate on perfomances: Dick Van Dyke in a one-man band performance (literally and fictionally) of singer, dancer, comic, and enigmatic companion to lead Julie Andrews (in her debut film!) who manages to be equally charming, sharp, pseudo-caustic, and wistful all at once. I especially love the scene which shows the first time the children are ordered to bed (after a rainstorm forces them 'out' of a watercolor painting) and, much too excited to forget about their magical day, are finally sung to sleep by Ms. Andrews in the contradictory "Stay Awake" lullaby. It is a great scene/number which gives some insight to Mary Poppins' character: efficient, strict, crisp, but also secretly caring and sentimental- just as long as nobody witnesses as such. This is re-iterated in her closing lines about 'practically perfect people,' but it is a carefully staged balance of emotions just the same. She deserved the Best Actress Oscar every step of the way.
This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time.  Mary Poppins is a wonderful story about two children who want a nanny who is cruel or cross.  Somehow they get Mary Poppins.  She instantly turns their lives around and brings the entire family closer together.  This movie is great for all ages.
How can one not give this film more than five stars?  How about 20 stars!! An incredible feat, this first film to incorporate animation with live action.  Dick Van Dyke and ensemble, not to mention Julie Andrews, who I believe is so credible as Mary Poppins, and she's so likeable, laughable that it's a shame that no other movies came along with her, but that was before sequels.  I'd say that this is at the top of the heap of all the best and the brightest of movies.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  And after you've seen it, you'll all want to "...go fly a kite," as the song said.  Inspiring, romantic, and it makes you feel good, too.
Probably one of the greatest works of the late Walt Disney himself. After this film the Disney studio completely lost their touch in creating a great film."Mary Poppins" is everything that is fun and is wonderfully acted by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The colors, the music score, the story, costumes, set design is all a wonderful tribute to the greatest creative artist of all times, Walt Disney.  The likes of him will never be seen again. The DVD version is also wonderful, the quality is excellent and is still one of my favorite films of all times. This is truly a classic for both young and old.
Another quote from the movie that accurately describes this classic. The music, dancing, and singing all make a great film. The DVD includes the best extras, like the making of featurette as well as film from the movie's premiere. This is a top-notch Disney musical that belongs in any DVD collection.
&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; has been around so long that it is hard to review objectively. I saw the film in the movie theatre in 1980 when I was 14 years old, and all my expectations were surpassed. There is so much to love about it, it's hard to analyze it without evoking sentimental memories of childhood.<br />While not quite in the same caliber as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, yet much better than &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, the movie does have irresistable assets: a lovely score, great sets and costumes, as well as infectious acting, singing and dancing by all the leads. The movie itself is somewhat episodic, with no real tension or conflict (unlike the tense and scary scenes of conflict in &quot;Wizard&quot;), and is about 45 minutes too long for contemporary audiences (1960's audiences didn't have short attention spans as they do today, and lumbering musicals could just take their own sweet time). Despite the accolades regarding the film's special effects, some of the blending of live-action and animation is just not on par with Disney's earlier classic &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). Even the wires used to fly Mary and her cohorts are sometimes glaringly visible, especially on a great DVD print, not to mention in the movie theater. Perhaps some of these shortcomings caused the film to not receive mention on the AFI's 100 Greatest Films list. Nevertheless, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a bona fide Disney classic, with a wonderful message about life and family.
This is an all time classic that is absolutely fabulous.  Mary Poppins is not only entertaining for young children, but is filled with british humor for parents/adults as well.<p>It is an excellent video, which everyone person and child should see at least once.
Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke did outstanding jobs in<br />this timeless Disney classic!Andrews is wonderful as the<br />kind-hearted yet strict nanny,and Van Dyke's performance<br />of Burt is very good;Van Dyke's Cockney accent is very well-<br />performed and convincing!The scenery is colorful and very<br />well-done,and the performers are superb!David Tomlisin is<br />perfect as the no-nonsense banker George Banks,and Reginald<br />Owen is wonderful as the elderly Admiral Boom!And who<br />can forget songs like the touching&quot;Feed the Birds&quot;or the<br />lively &quot;Step in Time&quot;?Young and old alike will be entertained<br />by this film.A must-have for any Disney collection!
&quot;It's as wonderful now as I remember it.&quot; Visual effects add to the story. Even though it is technologically dated, it doesn't matter. Teaches kids key lessons in a humorous way. &quot;I hope we never get too old or too sophisticated to enjoy a family gem like this.&quot; Enjoyed it and wanted to watch it again...&quot;over and over.&quot; Liked learning the lessons. &quot;You have to take the good with the bad...a spoonful of sugar helps.&quot; &quot;It's gonna be one of my favorites.&quot; &quot;It was supercalifragilistic...&quot; Ages 5-8, but good for all ages.
Disney again places out a fantastic performance with an all star cast of the 50's and 60s Starring Dick Van Dyke as both Bert and Mr. Dawes Sr.; David Tomlinson who starred in many Disney films of the time including Bednobs and Broomstiks stars as Mr. Banks also in the movie are Ed Wynn Karen Dortice and Matthew Garber and of course keeping in the Disney Tradition the Magic continues in this movie.  Walt had such a wonderful imagination to make this wonderful book come to life and all the great special effects were wonderful especially for 1964! The scene where they go into the paintings where we here Jolly Holiday and Supercalifragilisticexpialidcious where Bert and Mary dance with penguins and other characters in an all animated villiage too bad this site doesn't allow for 10 stars because it so much more deserving than a 5 star rating!
This is the rare children's film which I found to be just as delightful today as when I sunk into the plush seats of Radio City in 1964. Julie Andrews' glorious voice, and hilariously ironic, deadpan portrayal of the magical nanny, have boundless appeal.<p>Other characters are no less engaging: the troublesome Jane and Michael, Glynis Johns as the suffragette who deals with the Edwardian &quot;age of men&quot; on the home front, Ed Wynn bringing &quot;class&quot; to a tea party on the ceiling. Dick Van Dyke would make anyone hope to turn the corner and meet Bert - the stage performance would top that of the West End.<p>The story is great fun, acting and music first rate, and the situations the type that make one wish one could join in, popping into pavement pictures for sheer enjoyment.
Walt Disney's &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a glorious family film. Though I have only seen it on DVD (I wasn't born in 1964 when it opened at Radio City Music Hall), I was quite impressed by the special effects of the time including the &quot;Jolly Holiday&quot; sequence with dancing penquins, singing ducks and so on. Andrews is a class act. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert. And the songs are the kind of showtunes you'll sing again and again.
Mary Poppins is one of the stand-out live-action movies that Disney has ever produced.  The songs are very memorable - who out there does not find themselves humming or singing along with the likes of "Chim-Chim-Cheeree"?  Julie Andrews will always be remembered for her role as Mary Poppins, and Dick Van Dyke absolutely shines as Bert the Chimney Sweep.  The story is top-notch and has a wonderful moral without being too "preachy".  The animated bit is a little flat by today's standards, but it adds a wonderful bit of whimsey to a stellar production.  Highly recommended to any family with children.<br /><br />Then why only four stars?  Because there's a much better, two-disc, 40th anniversary edition that not only restores everythig to digital quality, but adds a second disc of deleted scenes, commentary, and many other cool new features.  Look for the new 40th anniversary DVD edition - it's worth waiting for!
Mary Poppins is one of my all-time favorites. Is fantastic film that is perfect in every way. the actors are excellent, the animation superb and the songs are unique. five years ago, Disney released a 40th Anniversary Edition DVD with 2 discs. It was one of the best DVDs editions that Disney had released with everything that we need to know about the movie besides the fantastic restoration of the film.<br /><br />This January, Disney released a 45th Anniversary Edition. While some people like me will think that was too soon for another re-release, Disney as usual, wants to gain more profits. This new DVD has the same picture and sound than the original. Nothing is shinier, crispier or anything. Is exactly the same. Disc one holds the same bonus material as the 40th Ann. Ed. Disc Two presents us Disney on Broadway, a bunch of featurettes that shows us the new Mary Poppins musical. This is completely a waste. We are concern about the movie itself not the musical so this is unnecessary. The other bonus materials are the same that the ones in the 40 Ann Ed. But, in order to put this Broadway featurerette, Disney dropped some good material about the movie that are encountered on the previous DVD. This material is: a game (not such a loss), the deconstruction of a scene featurette that was fun but most important of all, the Party where it shows the party after the preimiere of the film in 1964. What a shame that they dropped this extras to put things that have nothing to do with the film. So this is a very unnecessary DVD so my suggestion is don't buy it, and if you haven't bought Mary Poppins on DVD yet, buy the 40th Anniversary Edition which is still available and is the same price of this new Edition.
Mary Poppins may be =the= stand-out live-action movie that Disney has ever produced. Or will ever produce.<br /><br />All the songs are very memorable. Who out there does not find themselves humming or even singing along with the likes of "Chim-Chim-Cheree" or "Spoonful of Sugar"?<br /><br />Julie Andrews will always be remembered for her role as Mary Poppins, and Dick Van Dyke absolutely shines as Bert the Chimney Sweep. Van Dyke also plays the senior officer of the bank - and has his very best scene where he realizes that the punchline - "A wooden leg named Smith" - is funny. Andrews won an Academy Award for Mary Poppins, and the movie also won Best Visual Effects, and Best Music Score, as well as Best Song ("Chim Chim Cher-ee").<br /><br />The scene where "I love to laugh" is particularly poignant. Ed Wynn died not long after the release of Mary Poppins, and shows some of his best comedy style in this scene. Very laughable.<br /><br />The story is top-notch and has a wonderful moral without being too "preachy". It was a very good adaptation from the original novel, and it's a shame Disney never did any of P L Traver's own sequels to Mary Poppins.<br /><br />The animated bits are a little flat by today's standards, but they add a wonderful whimsey to a stellar production. Highly recommended to any family with children. A must-buy for Disney fans.<br /><br />This is the far better, two-disc, 40th anniversary edition that not only restores everything to digital quality, but adds a second disc of deleted scenes (and a song!), commentary, and many other cool new features. Look for the new 40th anniversary DVD edition - it's worth waiting for!<br /><br />It's just supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
"Mary Poppins" is one of that select group of films that can truly be called 'Classic', a project conceived in love and filled with so much child-like wonder that it will never grow old or 'out-of-date'. Certainly the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's remarkable career, the "Mary Poppins" 40th Anniversary Special Edition is simply magnificent!<br /><br />Based on P.L. Travers' tales of a magical nanny who arrives to bring families closer, the rights to the stories had been pursued by Disney since 1938, but Travers had seen what studios had done to other authors' works, and withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control. Years of negotiations only whetted Disney's desire to make a definitive, truly 'special' film, and by 1960, despite the box office failure of another fantasy-themed 'pet' project, "Darby O'Gill and the Little People", he was more confident than ever in the story's potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to 'visualize' 1910 London through his matte paintings.<br /><br />With Travers' grudging approval, casting began. While American stage and TV star Dick Van Dyke was an odd choice to play a Cockney chimneysweep, he was a gifted mime and physical comedian, and had such a wholesome exuberance that Disney knew British audiences would forgive his shaky accent. Popular British actors Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson would play the preoccupied parents, with Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (from "The Three Lives of Thomasina") as the neglected children. Veteran stars Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell (as the Bird Woman, in her last screen appearance), headed the strong supporting cast.<br /><br />But it was the casting of Julie Andrews, in her first film, as Mary Poppins, that truly 'made' the film! Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, "My Fair Lady" (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in "Camelot" on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right 'Mary', and approached her for the role. "But I'm pregnant," she told him. "No problem," he replied. "I'll wait!"<br /><br />And thus a Classic was born!<br /><br />A multiple 1964 Oscar winner (including 'Best Actress' for Andrews, who got to share the stage with her "Lady" costar, Rex Harrison, who won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.<br /><br />For it's 40th Anniversary, Disney's heirs have put together a spectacular package; along with the digitally-remastered film (it looks and sounds SUPERB!), a second disc of additional features includes a joyous reunion of stars Andrews and Van Dyke (who both seem ageless!); reminiscences of Robert Sherman, who sings a cute ditty cut from the final film; a fascinating 50-minute "behind-the-scenes" documentary about the production; featurettes on how the FX were achieved in several key scenes; and much, MUCH more! As the owner of several "Special Edition" Disney DVDs, I can honestly say, THIS is the BEST, yet!<br /><br />With the holidays fast approaching, I can't think of a finer gift to give, or to get!
Is there really much new to say about this classic Disney film that helped launch the movie career of Julie Andrews? Probably not, but for the handful of people who haven't seen this film, this DVD is a must-buy. Strangely enough, Disney is not releasing a Blu-ray version just yet, so this edition will have to tide over video buffs until that occurs. The 1964 classic is based on the books of P. L. Travers, with a few Disney liberties thrown in. Travers' nanny, Mary Poppins, is somewhat more harsh and unpleasant in the books than in the film version. However, it is obvious that she is hiding a heart of gold inside and that she truly does love the children she takes care. Two of the children did not make the transition from the book, but they are definitely not missed. Julie Andrews is able to bring out the many facets of Mary Poppins without compromising the character, and of course her voice is legendary. The Sherman Brothers whipped up some of their most memorable tunes including  "Jolly Holiday," "Spoonful of Sugar," and "Let's Go Fly a Kite."<br /><br />In a nutshell, the story is about a magical nanny who swoops in to take care of the Banks children, Jane & Michael, and also help their father realize what he is missing by ignoring them the way that he does. Along the way she treats the children to adventures with a street performer/chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) as well as her Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) who loves to laugh. One of the most memorable and touching sequences is the "Feed the Birds" numbers, with veteran actress Jane Darwell making her final screen appearance. One of Walt Disney's favorite songs, it is sure to bring a tear to many eyes.<br /><br />For those that have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VEPRQ">Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)</a>, here's what's missing on this edition:<br /><br />* Deconstruction of a Scene: Jolly Holiday & Step in Time sequences are examined thoroughly.<br /><br />* "I Love to Laugh" Game (not a big deal for me!)<br /><br />Here are the extras that ARE included:<br /><br />Backstage Disney<br /><br />* Disney on Broadway (All New to DVD)<br /><br />- "Mary Poppins from Page to Stage": The story of Mary Poppins from book to Broadway as the creative team and cast prepare to take the long running show on tour. A very well-done documentary on the stage production of "Mary Poppins," detailing almost every aspect of the production that began in London. Especially interesting is how P.L. Travers did not want any "Americans" involved in the stage production, as she was truly not happy with what Disney did with her books. This feature takes you all over the globe: interviews with the 2 leads are held in NYC at Sardi's restaurant; an interview with one of the Sherman Brothers is filmed in Beverly Hills; interviews with the stage productions composers George Stiles & Anthony Drewe are held in England (they did a fantastic job of blending their compositions seamlessly with the Sherman Brothers' songs from the film). You'll also hear from Bob Crowley, the scenic and costume designer, detailing how he came up with the sets (inspired by the book's illustrations) and changes he made for the touring production. All in all, a very fascinating extra!<br /><br />- "Step in Time": The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the number "Step in Time" from the show. This is a nice glimpse into the stage production. Although it doesn't quite have the pizzazz of the filmed number (what a tough act to follow), the choreography, sets, and costumes work together to create a fantastic production. Especially effective is the use of costumes and make-up to create the illusion of the chimney sweeps are in black and white, making Mary Poppins in her red dress stand out even more.<br /><br />- Step in Time - Downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing "Step in Time," featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.<br /><br />- Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley<br /><br />- Bob Crowley's Design Galleries: Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical<br /><br />* Audio Commentary: with stars Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and songwriter Richard Sherman. There are a few archival comments included from Walt Disney and others. Fantastic track that really adds to the enjoyment of the film. Especially interesting is the "Feed the Birds" number, where Sherman talks about Mary Poppins instilling social responsibility into the children by planting the idea of feeding the birds with tuppence, thus setting off the important string of events at the end of the film. It is refreshing to hear that so many years later, both Andrews & Van Dyke (as well as Dotrice) still have a fondness for this film and the experience of making it.<br /><br />* Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts: View fun-filled facts about the creation of the movie during viewing. Mirrors some of the information from the commentary track, but still enjoyable to learn some of the behind-the-scenes info as you are watching the movie.<br /><br />* "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins": The definitive behind-the- scenes look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.<br /><br />* Movie Magic: A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life. This one is interesting, but appears to be geared more towards the young ones and early teens. Doesn't really go very deep.<br /><br />* The Gala World Premiere: Footage from the Red Carpet. What a feast this is; a few different rolls of film (mixing bw and color) have been edited together to recreate as much as possible of this magical evening. See Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Wynn, Cesar Romero, and so many more classic stars. Even Walt & his wife are on hand (it even appears that Walt is gently chastising the costumed Mickey character at one point).<br /><br />* Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test for his role of the elder Mr. Dawes. On the commentary track, Karen Dotrice (Jane Banks) admits that during filming, she was not told that Dick Van Dyke was playing the elder Mr. Dawes. She thought it was just some old smelly man who was close to death!<br /><br />* Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film<br /><br />* Mary Poppins Still Art Galleries<br /><br />Music & More<br /><br />* Disney's Song Selection: Sing along to "A Spoonful of Sugar," "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen. Each song can be selected separately or while watching the film.<br /><br />* Magical Musical Reunion: Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and songwriter Richard Sherman reminisce about making Mary Poppins and the music that makes it so special.<br /><br />* A Musical Journey with Richard Sherman: A delightful magical journey through some of the film's locations with co-composer Richard Sherman, who reveals surprising secrets about the music of Mary Poppins along the way.<br /><br />* Bonus Short: "The Cat That Looked at a King": Live action and animation based on a chapter from P.L. Travers' sequel "Mary Poppins Opens the Door." Julie Andrews hosts this short done in the style of the whimsical chalk drawings from the movie "Mary Poppins." Vocal talents of Sarah Ferguson, Tracey Ullman, and David Ogden Stiers.<br /><br />* Deleted Song: "Chimpanzoo": A reconstruction of a song that did not appear in the movie using original storyboard and concept art, accompanied by a new rendition of the song performed by co- composer Richard Sherman. Personally, I agree with the deletion of this number!<br /><br />Specs: Video is original aspect ration of 1:66:1, and audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound with French & Spanish language tracks & subtitles. The picture, as in the 40th release, is fantastic. Colors bright, image sharp. The 5.1 mix is fantastic, especially during the musical numbers--all of your speakers will get full use! I read another review on here that only seemed to get front-speaker action, but I clearly heard music and effects loud and clear from my rear speakers, giving a very nice surround effect.<br /><br />There are also sneak peaks into the next Tinker Bell installment as well as other upcoming DVD/Bluray releases (Monsters Inc and Pinocchio this Spring and Beverly Hills Chihuahua).
In 1964, Walt Disney Pictures, under the directorship of Robert Stevenson, released what became a timeless, musical, fantasy called "Mary Poppins".  Starring Julie Andrews as the mysterious & magical Mary Poppins, the film is a fictional account of a dysfunctional family living in London circa 1910.  The father, George W. Banks (David Tomlinson, who played Emelius Browne in "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" in 1971), is obsessed with his job at a prestigious Fidelity Fiduciary Bank and with maintaining a professional atmosphere at all times at home.  The mother, Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns, whose film career began in 1938), is preoccupied with demonstrating as a suffragette and maintaining a clean home.  Their young children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber, who died at the young age of 21 in 1977), are allowed minimal time with their parents, who prefer to have a nanny look after and raise their children for them.  Unfortunately, Jane and Michael rarely like any of their nannies, who regularly quit after the children do something mischievous to each of them.  Also working for Mr. & Mrs. Banks are the maid Ellen (Hermione Baddeley, who played Mrs. Cratchit in the 1951 classic "Scrooge") and the cook Mrs. Brill (Reta Shaw, who played in "Pollyanna" in 1960 and "The Ghost & Mr. Chicken" in 1966), neither of which have the time or the desire to look after Jane and Michael.<p>Following the departure of yet another nanny, George decides to hire an appropriate nanny himself.  Jane and Michael write their own advertisement for a nanny, but George regards their innocent description as rubbish as he intends to find a nanny that will uphold his every professional expectation.  Mysteriously, the children's advertisement, that George tossed out, comes to Mary Poppins.  When a very lengthy line of perspective nannies are seen at the Banks' front door early one morning, all of them are blown away by a strong wind.  Coming down from the sky via an umbrella is the magical Mary Poppins.  Expecting a rush of perspective nannies to race through the door, only Mary Poppins waits to enter the Banks' home.  George interviews Mary, but he is quickly confused by her wit and unexpectedly hires her.  From that point on, nothing is quite the same in the Banks home and the children get a nanny that not only fulfills their expectations, but becomes something much more to them.  Along the way, the children are also introduced to several interesting people, including the handyman Bert (Dick Van Dyke, who starred in his own 1961 TV show and starred in "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"), Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn, who also played the toy-maker in "Babes in Toyland" in 1961) and the bird woman (Jane Darwell).<p>Many of the songs in the film are well known by people who have never seen the film, including:<p>* "Sister Suffragette" (4.5/5, Glynis John).  Winifred calling for the rights of women to be able to vote.<br />* "The Life I Lead" (5/5, David Tomlinson).  George describing his life and what a British home should be.<br />* "The Perfect Nanny" (4.5/5, Karen Dotrice & Matthew Garber).  Jane & Michael telling what they want in a nanny to their parents.<br />* "A Spoonful of Sugar" (5/5, Julie Andrews).  Mary encouraging the children to clean their rooms upon her arrival.<br />* "Pavement Artist (Chim-Chim-Cheree)" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert's carefree life.<br />* "Jolly Holiday" (4.5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert describing how wonderful it is to be with Mary Poppins again within the sidewalk chalk painting.<br />* "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" (5+/5, Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke).  A word you use when you don't know what else to say.<br />* "Stay Awake" (5/5, Julie Andrews). A lullaby to Jane and Michael.<br />* "I Love To Laugh" (4.5/5, Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Ed Wynn). Uncle Albert is visited who is suffering from incurable laughter.<br />* "A British Bank (The Life I Lead") (5/5, David Tomlinson & Julie Andrews). Mary telling George that he'll be taking the children to the bank with him.<br />* "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)" (5/5, Julie Andrews). Mary describing the life of a poor woman who enjoys feeding birds.<br />* "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson) Mr. Dawes Sr. (also played by Dick Van Dyke), the CEO of George's bank, sings praises to the British banking system with George to Jane and Michael.<br />* "Chim-Chim-Cheree" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).

George & Winifred spending time with Jane and Michael.<p>It is not surprising that so many children and adults alike love "Mary Poppins".  It's catchy songs and fantastic situations propel the audience into a magical world of laughter and love that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  It also made Julie Andrews a household name with her unforgettable performance as Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews went on to play leading roles in "The Americanization of Emily" (1964), "The Sound of Music" (1965), "10" (1979) and "Victor/Victoria" (1982).<p>I highly recommend the purchase of "Mary Poppins" on DVD, where it can be fully appreciated in its widescreen format.  I rate this DVD with 5 out of 5 stars.
This is a 5-star movie crammed into a 1-star DVD. If you're renting a movie, you only plan on seeing it once... when you buy a movie, you have bought the right to see it whenever you please for as long as you want.  This DVD has FORCED COMMERCIALS! You can not skip them and you are forced to fast-forward through them.  Instead of endearing you to the movies featured in the trailers, you eventually get so mad that the thought of those films makes your blood boil... especially if you already have purchased those films on DVD and you don't need to be coerced into buying them in the first place.<p>There is no excuse for this. Disney should offer refunds and/or replacement discs to those who purchased them on good faith.<p>In addition to the forced commercials, the tech specs are misleading and plain wrong. While the film is widescreen, it is NOT anamorphic as is claimed... this means that while it is in letterbox format, it is not in proper proportion and the images are slightly distorted.<p>Just throwing a movie on a round disk does not a DVD make and this is proof. <p>The movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings... but as the title of this review states - this is a DVD review, not the film. I'd advise waiting until a collector's edition comes out. A collector's edition is likely to contain more features such as interviews with the cast, out-takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year... and (one can only pray) no forced commercials.
A fantastic and magical family film, "Mary Poppins" continues to be a Disney classic that would win five Academy Awards and would be remembered for being a film that combined Disney's cartoon animation and real characters, the film debut of Julie Andrews but most of all, the spectacular chemistry and musical dance numbers featuring songs that continue to be classics.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />Mary Poppins was digitally restored and remastered in this 45th Anniversary Special Edition.  Although an older film, the remastering does look good for a film of its time.  Granted, I would love to see how this film would look on Blu-ray but  for DVD, the video looks very good.<br /><br />As for audio, the film's music and the dialogue comes out quite clear on my home theater.  Audio is presented in either Dolby Digital 5.1 or Original 2.0 Theatrical Mix.  The film sounds wonderful via Dolby Digital 5.1.  Music really comes alive but I didn't really notice all channels being utilized for those who were wondering but I did notice certain instruments being used in my front left and right channels of my stereo system which was nice.  But this is pretty much a dialogue and music-driven film and both come out quite clear.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This 45th Anniversary Edition of "Mary Poppins" is absolutely loaded with special features.  Included are:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and Richard Sherman recall the making of Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke did a commentary one one day, Karen Dotrice (plays the daughter in the film) and film and songwriter, Richard Sherman did a commentary on the following day.  Both commentaries are spliced together and done quite well.  What I found so fantastic is that Julie Andrews has not watched the complete film since the premiere back in 1964, so this was her first time watching it completely since then.  And to hear these talents just commenting on different parts of the film and what they remember of doing those scenes was just nostalgic and informative.  What a great commentary!<br />  * Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts--Select this option and fun-filled facts about the creation of this classic film pop up during viewing.<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />  * Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins--The definitive behind-the-scenes.  This 50+ minute featurette takes a look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.  Featuring interviews with the cast and learning so much about the film.  A great featurette.<br />  * Movie Magic--A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life.  For 1964, to combine both animation and live action film together and create this magical world was a technical marvel.  So, this featurette was also great to watch!<br />  * The Gala World Premiere--Footage from the Red Carpet.  This was aired on television as a one hour special but the footage had been lost.  Several minutes (not the complete version) of the archived film of this premiere was found in two countries, a black and white version and color and it was pieced together to create the 17+ minutes of footage from the red carpet premiere.<br />  * Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test - How Dick Van Dyke was made to look like the very old bank owner with make up and all.<br />  * Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film - From the original 1964 trailers, TV spots, Julie Andrews theater greetings and the re-issue trailers from 1974 and much more.<br />  * Mary Poppins Still Art Galleries - A lot of art was created for this film.  So, these are the still art galleries.<br /><br />Music & More<br /><br />  * Disney's Song Selection--The whole family can sing along to "A Spoonful of Sugar," "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen. Each song can be selected separately or while watching the film.<br />  * Magical Musical Reunion--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and songwriter Richard Sherman reminisce about making Mary Poppins and the music that makes it so special.  A fantastic featurette especially to see them sing once more.  Fantastic!<br />  * A Musical Journey with Richard Sherman --A delightful magical journey through some of the film's locations with co-composer Richard Sherman, who reveals surprising secrets about the music of Mary Poppins along the way.  Another fantastic featurette with Richard Sherman revealing some tidbits about the songs used for the film and how Walt Disney reacted to some of the songs.<br /><br />Bonus Short<br /><br />  * The Cat That Looked at a King--Live action and animation bring a chapter of P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins Opens the Door to life! Julie Andrews takes viewers into a magical animated world created in the style of the whimsical chalk drawings in Mary Poppins.  This segment is about 10 minutes long.<br /><br />Deleted Song<br /><br />  * "Chimpanzoo"--A reconstruction of a song that did not appear in the movie using original storyboard and concept art, accompanied by a new rendition of the song performed by co-composer Richard Sherman.<br /><br />Backstage Disney:  Disney on Broadway<br /><br />  * Mary Poppins from Page to Stage --First a beloved children's book, then a classic movie and now a smash hit Broadway musical! Fans can follow the story of Mary Poppins from page to stage as the creative team and cast discuss the creation of the musical production and preparations for the upcoming North American tour*.<br />  * Step in Time--The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the never-before-filmed number "Step in Time" from the show.<br />  * Step in Time - A downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing "Step in Time," featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.<br />  * Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley<br />  * Bob Crowley's Design Galleries--Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" is definitely a true classic.  The film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and eventually winning five academy awards for Best Actress, Film Editing, Music Score, Music Song for "Chim-Chim-Cheree" and Special Visual Effects".<br /><br />It's hard to believe that in 1964, there were two major musicals being created "Mary Poppins" and "My Fair Lady", "My Fair Lady" which eventually went to Audrey Hepburn and "Mary Poppins" going to the unknown actress Julie Andrews.  It was probably a blessing that Julie Andrews wasn't cast for "My Fair Lady" since "Mary Poppins" really jumpstarted Andrews career and eventually winning her the Academy Award for Best Actress.<br /><br />Of course, actor Dick van Dyke was popular with his television series "The Dick Van Dyke Show" but these two talents and their musical performance were well done.  I was quite impressed by how both would nail their dances and have them in sync and Julie Andrews would comment how the most difficult part of the film was syncing their mouths to the song and making sure their foot would match for that moment.<br /><br />This film back in 1964 introduced a family film with state of the art technology at that time. Real life actors working together with animated humans and animals, the actors flying around and most importantly, the music that came from this film.  Classics such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", the award winning song "Chim-Chim-Cheree", "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)", to name a few.  But what I discovered by watching the special feature was how important it was for Walt Disney.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" by P.L. Travers was created back in 1934 and for 20 years, Walt Disney would try unsuccessfully to get the rights for the film.  But he eventually managed to and while on one hand, really making sure the cast and the staff were well taken care of, it was quite surprising to know how much P.L. Travers actually detested the film (she wanted the animation to be eliminated).  So, there are interesting tidbits including audio that appears on the special features of Travers showing her discontent as an adviser to the film.  So, you get to learn more about this through a featurette on the DVD.  But it shows you how much Walt Disney really wanted "Mary Poppins" and how he tried so hard to get the rights to it.  But you really learned how much love went into the creation of this film and how much Walt Disney wanted this film to be loved.<br /><br />Just interesting details of how special he wanted this film, from giving people a chance such as signing Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman (the Sherman Brothers) to a contract to write and compose music for "Mary Poppins" (and future Disney films), casting an unknown Julie Andrews which Walt Disney loved her performance in "Camelot".  Disney wanted her to be Mary Poppins and despite her being pregnant at the time, he waited for her until after she gave birth to become part of the film.  Another tidbit was while meeting with Julie,  Walt Disney met her husband at the time, Tony Walton (a costume and set designer) and eventually giving him a chance to work on "Mary Poppins" (who also eventually inspired the Sherman Brothers for the music of "Winnie the Pooh").  And my favorite tidbit, of Walt Disney casting well-known actress from the early 1900's Jane Darwell in the "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)" in what would be her final role, which was his way of giving her a special thank you to her for her accomplishments in film.  These are just among the few interesting tidbits from behind-the-scenes that one will learn through the various featurettes included on the DVD.<br /><br />As for the DVD version, there has been four previously released versions of "Mary Poppins" on DVD.  When Disney released the 40th Anniversary "Mary Poppins" on DVD back in 2004, it was hard to imagine how Disney could top that with the 45th Anniversary edition.  Surprisingly, Disney managed to pull of another spectacular release with the 45th Anniversary edition with even more special features than the original.<br /><br />The new feature added to the 45th Anniversary edition of the DVD  features the all-new "Mary Poppins: From Page to stage" which includes a fantastic documentary on the making of the Tony Award winning musical produced with Cameron Mackintosh.  Despite P.L. Travers really disliking the Walt Disney film, "Mary Poppins" was eventually given a musical treatment after P.L. Travers gave Cameron Mackintosh the OK but of course with certain guidelines in her will and testament before her death.<br /><br />The primary guideline was that a musical could be created with the understanding that only English born writers and no one from the original film production could be involved with the creative process of the musical.  The musical was a great hit in the UK but when it came to doing the musical in the US, this is where things definitely gets interesting and Disney manages to create a lengthy featurette on the process of creating the musical in the US, also a featured performance of a "Step in Time", an opportunity for people to download the MP3 and also a chance for people to see Bob Crowley's designs for the musical.<br /><br />The original film will always be magical and in the hearts of those who truly were captivated by it but this musical was amazingly done.  The costumes, the stage setup, the designs, everything looked spectacular and sure enough, the musical received rave reviews in the US as well.<br /><br />So, you really get all the fantastic special features from the 40th Anniversary including the bonus short animation "The Cat That Looked at a King" which stars Julie Andrews (and can be considered a short sequel) plus the new bonus features from the musical on this 45th Anniversary Edition.<br /><br />Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment managed to successfully pull of another spectacular release for the 45th Anniversary Edition.  This is the definitive version to own!  Highly recommended.
I was nine years old when Walt Disney produced the first movie I remember being a "must see": Mary Poppins.  After seeing it numerous times as a child, I bought the new DVD - thought I might enjoy seeing it again and sharing it with my nieces and nephews.  <p>Mary Poppins retains the same magic and wonder that I remember experiencing as a child. She still remains this enigma - who was she really?  Where did she come from?  What was really going on between her and Bert? The movie answers none of these questions - it just lets them float in the air like it's magical heroine. And that's part of its charm.  The film seems to live by Mary's maxim: "I never explain anything".  <p>Technically - the film holds up as well, even in this age of digital everything.  I was amazed to learn (in the "Making of" documentary that's included on the CD) that the film was shot entirely on the Disney soundstages in Burbank.  They never went on location; they never even went outside.  London is "painted in" in a series of beautiful matte glass paintings.  (If I remember correctly, even today, it is the largest number of glass background paintings ever used in a film.) <p>Julie Andrews, of course, is "practically perfect in every way" as Mary - a much more idiosyncratic character than the governess she famously played in "Sound of Music" a year later.  And that clear soprano voice - never showy, always in character - just lifts the film.  Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert - though accents are clearly not his strong suit.  But as a comic, a mime, a singer and a dancer he is charming as the Jack-of-all-trades friend of Mary.  <p>The DVD looks great.  It's letterboxed - but it wasn't shot in wide screen format - so you don't loose much on your TV screen.  The colors are snappy and true.  There is a new "Making of" feature, produced especially for the DVD hosted by Dick Van Dyke and featuring interviews with Julie, and some of the other technical team that are still around.  There is some great home movie footage of the chimney sweep dancers rehearsing "Step in Time" outside in the California heat stripped down to their skivvies.  <p>The one thing on the DVD I do NOT appreciated is a long series of promos for other Disney video releases that you can't cancel out of easily and skip to the film. I think it's rather shameless forcing kids to sit through those commercials to see their favorite movie.<p>All in all - a beautiful presentation of a classic film that adults and children can enjoy together.
I hear there are two versions of Mary Poppins' DVD going around - a single layer and a dual layer version.<br />I unfortunately and unknowingly bought the single layer. Middle of the movie, it stops dead, an animated hand appears showing a disc being turned over and you have to leap up and flip your disc for the movie to resume. This is almost sacriledge in any movie but to do it in Mary Poppins is a crime. It kills the flow and destroys the magic. It should be clearly marked on the label if you have to flip your disc.<br />So be warned all: check if you are getting the dual layer version on any long movie. If not, do not buy it.
This is probably one of Walt Disney's best films, if not the best. It is the most excellent realized combination of live action and animation. It  contains eternal charm, wit, and magic as it introduces us to the  &quot;practically perfect&quot; nanny who brings profound change to the  Banks family of London in the early twentieth century. Every song composed  by Richard and Robert Sherman is pure magic. The believable visual effects,  the heartfelt scripting, and the solid performances by Julie Andrews and  the heart rendering Dick Van Dyke are truly eternal. Every element of  production came together at their zenith to create a treasure of cinematic  endearment. The DVD is excellent. The supplemental material is very good  and nostalgic. One of the best films ever made. The superb cast also  includes: David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher,  Ed Wynn, Hermione Baddeley, Reginald Owen and Jane Darwell as The Bird  Woman. Director, Robert Stevenson is at his best.
Mary Poppins was released in 1964.  The following year Julie Andrews starred in The Sound of Music.  Both are terrific films, and the Disney creation fairs reasonably well against the specacular Austrian setting of the 1965 Robert Wise production.<p>Dick Van Dyke deserves special praise for virtually stealing many scenes. The entire supporting cast is first-rate.  I especially enjoyed David Tomlinson as the stuffy banker/father.<p>The music composed especially for &quot;Poppins&quot; remains as bright and snappy as was in 1964. <p>Even if you own this film on VHS, the bonus features available on the DVD make it worth purchasing.
This is by far my favorite Disney movie ever.  The music is unforgettable and the acting is funny and excellent.  The plot is magical and the script is charming and heart-warming.  It is a great children's film and it is a picture that really touches you and pulls you in.  Some images are beautiful and elegant, like the haunting &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; sequence and the roof smoke climbing.  It is funny and has great ironic humor like the bank scene and the scene when Mr. Banks is being laid off as the employers puzzle at his crazy realization.  MARY POPPINS is a great movie for everyone and is a classic movie for everyone to enjoy.
this magical roller coaster ride will sweep you off your feet and you will not land on the ground until the credits begin to roll. this is a reminder of how creative and charming film has been and still could be. lots of fun  to watch with the kids and still today, even the adults. buy it!
Mary Poppins is a true classic. I've probally seen it over 20 times and it's always like watching it the first time. It's got wit, charm and heart. 'Feed the Birds' is probally the most underrated Disney song. It always  makes me cry. Buy this video and watch it over and over! You'll enjoy it  all over again.
Let me start by saying I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  It is one of the few movies I can watch over and over.  I remember as a child when I had the chicken pox over christmas break, and I must have watched this movie a hundred times.  The story is wonderful, and in my opinion even though it is often times lumped in with family movies instead of musicals, it has to be one of the best musicals ever made.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were made for their roles.  The little children were wonderful as well.  The supporting cast is made up of the Walt Disney stable of actors that he used over and over again, but you really don't notice because they are all such good character actors they make their parts real to the viewer.<br /><br />You will love the animated scenes and the fox hunt is just crazy!<br /><br />This specific DVD version is the best because the behind the scenes stuff and documentries are great as they explain the animation, and how they painted the beautiful london cityscape on glass.  The Disney fanatics should also buy this as they will get a special peek into the Disney movie machine that isn't usually shown on camera.<br /><br />On my personal top list of all time I rate it #15<br /><br />So get this movie and watch it again and again and again!
Hello,<br /><br />When I was little I remember watching this movie with my family and friends and I still even remember so much of the detail. Today in our society there are plenty of negative influences once your kids, or any kid gets into middle school or earlier, but the best brain growth is even before that. Why not take advantage of this time and get them something wonderful and positive and affirming!?!!! This is such a great story and it and the songs will stick with your children or any children giving them something to sing and play with. Not only that, but this is the type of movie that can be watched over and over again for enjoyment to give your kids simply something to do! I highly recommend this classic movie to anyone with kids or as a gift to anyone that has them! I know I benefited, my friends did, and the kids in your life will too...and the adults :)<br /><br />I hoped you liked my review and found it useful!!!!<br /><br />Sam Kochel
This is a great movie ... maybe the perfect movie, in that it is entertaining from beginning to end, the story is easy to understand and take a personal interest in, the bad guys are never too scary, and the ending could not be happier.<br /><br />The morals too are right ... children are more important than adults, the family is more important than the job (or cause), and good behavior is important, but so is having fun.<br /><br />I think it is fair to say that ... the better a movie is, the more times we will watch it.  And Mary Poppins ranks high in that department.  All the different parts (the acting, the wonderful songs, the animation) seem to come together perfectly, and the final product is, well, ... practically perfect in every way.<br /><br />Thank you Walt Disney for giving us this movie.<br /><br />A FEW WORDS MORE<br /><br />I recently got the 40th anniversary re-issue, and it is well worth buying ... especially for any "Mary Poppins" fan.  The quality of the extras is a little up and down, but we get the movie (and that's a lot) and the "Making Of ... " extra is excellent.<br /><br />A lot of people do good work for "Mary Poppins" and it's hard to pick one who might be called the MVP of the movie.  Robert Stevenson has an excellent eye as the director, Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi give us a wonderfully well thought out script, the instrumental arrangements for the songs and background music for the whole movie (done by Irwin Kostal) are excellent, Peter Ellenshaw does all those beautifully realistic background paintings (I love the one that opens the movie best), the Sherman brothers give us 13 great and memorable songs, the choreography (by Dee Dee Wood and Mark Breaux) is imaginative and fun, and the actors and actresses all do a great job (even the pigeons do a good job).  Glynis Johns is fun as Mrs. Banks ... funny in just about everything she does.<br /><br />... and there's Walt.  His guiding hand ensured that we got a perfect ... or practically perfect ... movie to be enjoyed for generations.<br /><br />FUN LINES FROM THE MOVIE<br /><br />Mrs. Banks:  I don't think we need bother the police dear.  The facts of the matter ...<br /><br />Mr. Banks:  Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.<br />--<br /><br />Jane Banks:  Wanted:  A nanny for two adorable children.<br /><br />Mr. Banks:  Adorable.  Well that's debatable, I must say.<br />--<br /><br />Bert:  Now's the time Mary Poppins.  No one's lookin'.<br />--<br /><br />Mrs. Banks:  As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household.<br /><br />Mr. Banks:  Is that so?<br /><br />Mrs. Banks:  Take Ellen for instance.  She hasn't broken a dish all morning.<br /><br />Mr. Banks:  Really.  Well that is extraordinary.<br />--<br />--<br />NICE LITTLE TOUCHES<br /><br />Jane and Michael are usually made to speak ... alternatingly.  Jane will say a sentence, then Michael will say a sentence, then Jane, then Michael.  It fits very nicely into the movie.<br /><br />The children are (a couple of times) made to be peering through the banister posts ... a nice touch.<br /><br />Jane, after measuring Mary Poppins, is seen rising up.  Somebody had to think of doing that, and it works nicely.<br /><br />After Mary Poppins returns the robin to the outdoors, she closes the cutains, and a slight breeze is then seen blowing the curtains inward.  A nice little touch.<br /><br />In the cartoon sequence, one of the baby swans is made to do a sort-of spazmatic little swim.  A nice touch, I think.<br /><br />After singing "Feed the Birds" Mary Poppins gently brushes the side of Jane's head.  A nice little touch.<br /><br />When fleeing from the bank ... out the door ... the edge of Jane's is seen as the bank guard grabs for her.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, while starting to fly their kite, Jane is made to be holding the forefingers of her mother.  A nice little touch.<br /><br />TRIVIA QUESTION<br /><br />When Mary Poppins (and Jane and Michael) meet Bert in the park, and Bert outlines Mary Poppins' silhouette, .... what time is it?<br /><br />(answer)<br />It is nine o'clock.  A clock can be heard chiming in the background, and it chimes nine times.<br /><br />A CURIOUS THING<br /><br />Late in the movie, when Ellen (the maid) dances up and says "It's the master!" there is a black object on her shoulder.  It looks like a black glove, and I wonder why they had it there.
"Mary Poppins" is back and I am glad that she is: all spiffed up, digitally remastered, looking young and fresh once again.<br /><br />It has been many years since I've seen Mary (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) and if anything the film is more fun, the songs more tuney and beautifully performed than ever.<br /><br />In many ways "Mary Poppins" is aimed at adults, rather than children: the Suffragette story line of Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) and the honor-your-children-as-human-beings story line of Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson).<br /><br />In other words, "MP" is more profound, deeper, thoughtful and sadder for adults than it would be for children. It works on at least two levels and that's more than you can say for some of the tripe being released recently.<br /><br />At the finale when Mary's duty is completed and it is time for her to move on to another family, I shed a tear for good old Mary and particularly for Julie Andrew's performance as Mary: you can have your current pop icons, I'll take Mary Poppins... no spoonful of sugar needed.
This is my favorite movie of all time. I was very glad to get this on DVD!  My VHS is just about to rip apart. Great graphics and sound! AWESOME  behind-the-scenes stuff!! I haven't found one bad thing about this DVD, OR  the movie. I bought this DVD a few weeks after it was released (I didn't  know this edition just came out at the end of June!!!) while on vacation in  Canada, and I've watched it SO many times already, and no problems with  it.<p>I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
That's how the incomparably magical nanny Mary Poppins describes herself with nary a boastful smirk on a revealing tape measure in this still charming 1964 Disney classic musical set in post-Victorian London circa 1910. I was five years old when it was originally released, and I managed to convince my mother to take me to see it six times. I just saw it last night for the first time in over four decades on the big screen in a sing-along version similar to what has been done with "The Sound of Music". I still feel a genuine warmth about this movie as an adult. Such was the impact of Julie Andrews in her big screen debut, as she epitomizes the title character with equal quantities of starch and sugar.<br /><br />With her unyielding posture, coltish stature and perfectly clipped diction, Andrews found her archetypal role before she even blossomed as an actress, an intractable goody-goody image she sends up mercilessly 17 years later in her husband's savage Hollywood satire, "S.O.B." There is no getting around the fact that she is ideal as the indefatigable Mary in charge of Jane and Michael, the two moppet children of neglectful banker George Banks and his flighty suffragette wife Winifred. With the help of devoted friend Bert, a Cockney jack-of-all-trades and one-man-band, Mary sets out to inspire the children's imaginations while keeping a firm though kind-hearted hand on their behavior. What I notice this time as an adult is how Mary wields a similarly positive influence on George albeit after much patriarchal consternation and sexist-driven protest.<br /><br />There are so many delightful scenes that it's hard to choose which to highlight, though one of the best ones has to be the fantasy animated sequence through Bert's sidewalk painting. This is where Bert dances with the penguins, Mary leads Bert and her charges on liberated carousel horses through a foxhunt and a horserace, and both sing two of the best songs, "Jolly Holiday" and "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious". Another wonderful scene is the "Spoonful of Sugar" room clean-up scene with obviously mechanized robins and a bevy of stop-action effects. Using an overemphatic Cockney accent as Bert, Dick Van Dyke - who was then starring in his classic sitcom - is an endearing presence and a dexterous comic dancer. He also clowns around in heavy make-up as the very aged president of the bank at which George works.<br /><br />David Tomlinson plays George with appropriate gruffness under his gentlemanly demeanor, while Glynis Johns lends her ingratiating quality to Winifred. The children are played without affectation by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. Veteran character actors fill the rest of the roles expertly in what amounts to extended cameos - Ed Wynn as the eternally laughing and perpetually airborne Uncle Albert; Elsa Lanchester as Mary's frustrated predecessor, Katie Nanna; Arthur Treacher as the kindly Constable Jones; Reginald Owen as the delusional sea captain next door, Admiral Boom; Hermione Baddeley and Reta Shaw as the Banks's constantly flustered maids; and most touchingly, the 85-year old Jane Darwell (Ma Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath") as the bird woman on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral.<br /><br />The songs by the Sherman Brothers, Richard and Robert, are truly enchanting and memorable after all these years, especially the haunting "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)", the wistful "Chim-Chim-Cheree", and the almost "My Fair Lady"-sounding "The Life I Lead". I still have a few quibbles, for example, the "Step in Time" dance sequence is exceptionally choreographed but too darkly lit and goes on a bit too long to enjoy fully. Moreover, at 140 minutes, the movie drags a bit toward the end especially as George meets with the board of his bank. Regardless, director Robert Stevenson, who made many of the live-action Disney films of the 1960's, along with screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, have concocted what has to be one of the best family-oriented confections to come out of the Hollywood studios.
I can't believe that I hated this film when I was a kid, you would think that I would have liked it more back then. But about 3 months ago, I bought this DVD and saw the film for the first time in around a decade. I cannot believe it's the same movie, in fact, I started to wonder if I was even paying attention to it back then as it was playing.<p>The film is nothing less, and probably a lot more than a classic. Julie Andrews completely submerges herself into the character. She definitely deserved the Oscar that she got. The song's are strong, but a few stand out above the rest. Such as, &quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; and &quot;``Chim-Chim-Cheree&quot;.<p>I hope a Special Edition DVD will be released in the future, becuase I am very interested in seeing more behind the scenes documentaries, detailing the Visual Effects that were created for the movie. The Gold Collection DVD, does offer a good documentary that gives a lot of insight, but there has to be a lot more, and I would like to see it. The &quot;Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere&quot; featurette, is a great extra.<p>I do agree that this was Walt Disney's greatest LIVE ACTION film, but I do not think it's his greatest acheivement. That goes to &quot;Snow White&quot;, which influenced motion picture history a lot more than &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; did (and I'm not trying to lessen this film, in anyway).
The movie is great, but not the DVD.<br />Some times DVDs have this annoying &quot;Coming soon&quot; thing where you have to press the &quot;menu&quot; button to get to what you've paid for. Guess what, on this DVD... menu button is disabled, forcing you to &gt;&gt;| to the part that you care about.
Really enjoyed seeing this again.  After seeing some of the artifacts from the movie in Florida, it was nice to see their original use!<br /><br />The chinmey sweep song and dance "Step in Time" is my all-time favorite out of the movie.
This is one of my favorite musicals of all time featuring Julie Andrews as a brunette nanny who turns everyday activities into magical ones and helps a family remember their love for each other.
This reviewer recently watched "Mary Poppins" for the first time since its original theatrical release in 1964, and found the movie, now in its 45th Anniversary Edition, has lost none of its ability to charm and entertain.  A sweet-souled children's fairy tale disguised as a Walt Disney musical, "Mary Poppins" won five Academy Awards for its songs, its then-cutting edge mixture of animation and live action, and for the performance of a young Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins.<br /><br />In the movie, adapted from the stories by P.L. Travers, Mary Poppins magically arrives at the Banks home in 1910 London to serve as nanny to the two rather neglected Banks children, Jane and Michael.  Firm but fair, the "practically perfect" Mary Poppins restores order to the nursery through a combination of song and magic, and then begins to open the eyes of the children to the posssibilities of life and their own imaginations.  In company with the multi-talented chimney-sweep Bert (Dick Van Dyke), Mary and the children embark on a series of adventures that end up transforming the whole Banks household.<br /><br />Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were in their prime as singers and dancers, and their talent shows in a series of musical sequences, many with animated accompaniment.  The climactic dance sequence "Chim Chim Cher-ee" takes place on the rooftops of London, as Bert and his fellow chimney sweeps perform for Mary and the children.<br /><br />The movie is a marvel of subtlety, as Mary and Bert use song, humor, and compassion to persuade the harried banker Mr. Banks and his fervent suffregette wife that family should come first.  The sources of Mary's magical powers are left a pleasant mystery, as is the relationship between the prim and proper Mary and the clownishly charming but earthbound Bert.  This two disc edition includes some superb "making of" featurettes and interviews with the surviving cast members.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins: 45th Anniversary Edition" is very highly recommended as outstanding entertainment to Disney fans of all ages.
We bought Mary Poppins for our special needs 5 year old grandson who has CP.  He cannot walk or talk but when we played Mary Poppins for him, his reaction was STUPENDOUS! He clapped his hands, laughed out loud and kicked his feet.  He especially loves the part when Dick Van Dyke is dancing on the rooftops.  We have NEVER seen this type of interaction from him before.  We don't know what genius it took to put this movie together, but genius it was - from the songs, to the dancing, to the cast and especially Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE JULIE ANDREWS MOVIES. SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE, A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, AND A WONDERFUL DISPOSITION. THE ENTIRE CAST IS TERRIFIC!! I BELIEVE THIS WELL BE A CLASSIC FOREVER!!
We had a flawless transaction on this one. Plus, what a great classic. My wife loves Disney movies and this is one of her all time favorites, so it made a great gift.
Wonderful movie, even better on DVD.  Just a little bit of sugar helps the medicine go down.
I have loved this movie since I was a child and saw it in the theater.
Mary Poppins is a classic Disney movie.  I remember watching it as a child.  I had this movie on VHS and liked it so well that I have recently replaced it with a DVD.  My eight year old niece liked the movie so I have purchased her one for Christmas.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke make it a wonderful performance for people of all ages to enjoy.  It has a mixture of cartoons with live performances that gives a it a twist for good family entertainment.  I hope you enjoy it as well as my family has.
this is indeed a Disney Classic if every there was one. a must own. kids and adults will love it. great songs, great story. and the story has a MORAL. spend time with your kiddies. and be a good listener. and go fly a kite.<br /><br />dick van dyke and julie andrews rock. the animation sequences are lovely, the birds and little animals. and jumping into the chalk painting on the sidewalk... ahhh the memories. every childhood should include many viewings of good ole Mary Poppins. a must. my little Kyle watches all our Disney DVDs and videos over and over and over and over ..... better than out on the street getting into who-knows-what - hummm?!
It doesn't matter if you're 7 or 70. This movie pleases everyone. It's got a great soundtrack (don't know if it's still available but I inherited my mom's old LP record!), great acting (anything with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke has to be good), and has some scenes where live action and animation are combined. This was all done without the technology of today, yet another reason to appreciate the work in this film. The remastered DVD editions are great. Not sure what extras come with the newest one but the one I saw in 2001 had a good section about the making of the film.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone, and it will come as a blessing if you're sick of the garbage that Hollywood is making today.
This film is never disappointing. It allows you to immerse yourself in a simpler time when magic still seems like a possibility.<br /><br />And clearly I was not the only one impressed by this movie. It was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards in 1965 and proceeded to win 5 including: Julie Andrews for Best Actress in a Leading Role; Peter Ellenshaw, Hamilton Luske and Eustace Lucett for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects, Cotton Warburton for Best Film Editing, and Richard B. Sherman and  Robert B. Sherman for Best Music, Score - Substantially Original, as well as Best Music, Song. It also won a number of other awards including Golden Globes, Grammys and BAFTAs. Dick Van Dyke, who unfortunately didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, was nominated for the Best Actor award in the Golden Globes, but was unsuccessful.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins who, by unusual circumstances and highly original transportation, arrives at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to take up the role as nanny to Jane (Karin Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) who are the children of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns). Mary Poppins, together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a local street musician and chimney sweep, proceeds to take the children through a magical journey. Along the way she teaches George something about his values, and what the truly important things in his life are.<br /><br />Mary Poppins showcases excellent performance by all the leading players, and is a classic movie by any standard.
This DVD set arrived quickly, and upon review, proved to be a most fine rendition of this 40-year-old film! I will watch this perdiodically, and enjoy it over and over again for a long time to come!  Thank you!

The Disney film 'Mary Poppins' still retains all of its magic and entrancement for kids of all ages, and their parents, after all these years. Made in the sixties, it has lost none of its appeal.
I bought this movie for my 3 year-old daughter. She has now watched it at least 20 times and can sign a lot of the songs. It is as much fun for her today as it was for me when I was a child.
I'm 16 and I grew up watching this. Though it's almost 50 years old now, it's still probably one of the best childrens' movies ever made. The special effects were amazing for the time, and some are still unnoticeable today. The actors are great, with Julie Andrews as Mary and Dick Van Dyke as Bert. The music sends chills down my spine when i listen to it. It's just an amazing movie, even 50 years later.
I started watching this and boy, its really fun to sing to. I can't wait to go on a cross country rode trip and belt out the tunes from this film! Dick Van Dyke fan, loved him in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang too. Julie Andrews wow what a lady! She looks so pretty in this film.
I grew up watching Mary Poppins and loved it. So I wanted to share this movie with my 3 & 5 yr old daughters! They loved it too!!! A great movie we can share together!
This is an excellent movie for children and also the not so young...good family entertainment... our grandchildren (2---9yrs)Just love the movie and sing the songs when in the car etc... only downside!!! they now ask for the spoon full of sugar  if they have to take some medicine...lol lol...all in all a great movie that has not dated...no crash,bash or violence... just wonderful family fun movie....young ones just love it...
This movie was purchased as a gift from my girlfriend to one of her buddies and she loves it.my girlfriend and her buddie both love disney flicks.
although I saw this many years ago when I was younger it is still a great movie and a real classic one all can enjoy for a long time to come
For some reason, MARY POPPINS is a movie I have avoided through the years. I knew many of the songs and references to the film, but I never had a desire to see it. It seemed like it would be silly and cliche. Finally, I took the leap and began watching MARY POPPINS. For a while, I was sure I had been right through the years. Who cares about the Banks family and the cold and aloof Mr. Banks and the rather scattered Mrs. Banks? Because Julie Andrews literally lights up the screen as Mary Poppins, I kept watching. Her remarkable voice is a true gift and I could start putting songs I have heard into context.<br />Enter Dick Van Dyke as the seriously miscast Bert. His fake Cockney accent was irritating and I just could listen to his voice. The story chugs along in its silliness. Then something truly magical takes place. The story and the characters come together and in my opinion, it begins when they make an emergency visit to the "ailing" Uncle Albert played by the one and only Ed Wynn. Uncle Albert's illness? He loves to laugh and the more he laughs, the more weightless he becomes and he floats to the ceiling. His joyous laughter becomes infectious and soon Bert and the kids are floating with laughter much to the chargin of Mary Poppins. Here was the turning point and the rest of the film seemed delightful.<br />Walt Disney's mix of live action and animation was ahead of its time. He was always the innovator and I can only imagine how the eyes of young children lit up seeing this magical spectacle on the big screen in 1964. Long before computer animation, special effects were created by hand. Dick Van Dyke's dance with animated penguins is a charmer. It's Van Dyke's physical comedy that fills the screen. Forget his fake cockney accident, just relish with delight his long-legged rubbery figure as he cheefully makes his  way across the screen.<br />There could not have been another actress more perfect for the role of Mary Poppins as was Julie Andrews..lovely and young and beautiful, her songs are full of life and zest. No nonsense "practically perfect" Mary Poppins puts on a serious face but you know she loves the Banks children and her roll in bringing the family together. Stern Mr. Banks melts into joy with his children and Mary Poppins brings the family together.<br />We never know why Mary Poppins has magical powers. Even Bert seems to have magic in him. Mary flies over the streets of London with her open unbrella. She makes it all look effortless.<br />MARY POPPINS was off to a slow start with me and I went with the flow and was led into a delightful fantasy. Everyone needs a Mary Poppins in their life!
I am unable to play this Mary Poppins DVD as it is not for my region and will not play. My grandchildren were extremely disappointed and I felt I had been duped.  I think Amazon should send me a replacement that will play in Australia. I have bought before and always been happy, but will hesitate before I buy from Amazon again.
Having just seen the Broadway Play, I wanted my granddaughter to see the original with Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke.  It was so colorful and wonderful.  So glad we found it on Amazon.
Of course, what do you expect when you watch Mary Poppings.  It was just as it has always been and will always be.
I bought a copy of Mary Poppins for my daughters and they love it. I saw this movie when I was a kid 40 years ago and wanted to share it with them. They are still sign Chin Chimeny!
My husband and I have been slowly but surely adding to our 'classic' movie collection and had been waiting for a good price on this. We love this movie and really liked the special features on this. I can't pick a 'favorite scene' cause there are so many. Definitely worth the wait, we have watched it twice so far lol!
This is a fantastic movie and music for kids!  these classic tunes and funny dialog had my 7 year old laughing and singing all week.
We had this movie on vhs when my children were growing up.  They loved it and watched it many times.  I ordered this dvd for our granddaughter who is not quite 2 years old yet and she already loves "Poppins"!  I was so glad to get it on dvd at such a good price.
I received this dvd for Christmas and it is wonderful. The extras are great taking you behind the scenes. I always loved Mary Poppins but now I love it more if that is possible. I recommend this to anyone who grew up with this movie or if you have someone who will see it for the first time.
The best movie every!  Super fast delivery too. This is a wonderful movie for any child or adult - lots of singing, dancing, and just fun!
The kids love this classic movie. They sing and dance to it all the time.  My husband was tired of it after the 7 time in one week.
How wonderful to be able to share with my daughter one of my favorite movies.  The disc set came packaged new and shipping was so fast.  I believe I have enjoyed it even more now because I can share a clean and positive movie with her.  And she absolutely loves watching the singing and dancing.
A classic movie that never gets old!  Can't wait for my kids to watch it come Christmas morning!  Julie Andrews is amazing.
This was a great movie when it came out.  It was a great movie for years.  It is still an outstanding movie and as enjoyable decades later as it was originally.  A great family movie for any personal library.
I got this video for my 6yr old grandaughter - and even with all of the new amazing technology available, she absolutely loved this movie!  She still talks about it and wants to watch it again.  It was wonderful to share something from my childhood with her that she equally enjoyed without thinking it was "old or outdated".
It is a very good movie! A classic and my kids love to watch it! Fun for the whole family!
My daughter enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a little girl! Great movie and still fun to watch as an adult.
Loved this movie when I was younger and still do.  I gave a "Mary Poppins" party for some students at my school and we all watched & sang together.  A classic musical for all ages!!
This classic movie was wonderful when my children were young and can still capture the attention of my grandchildren!<br />It's entertaining and leaves all with a feeling of wellbeing!
C.S. Lewis believed that a story worth enjoying at 10 is worth enjoying again at 50.  While I do enjoy my childhood favorites: Gone With the Wind, Little Women, and Lewis' own Narnian series, I believe I can lower the age limit and say that a story worth enjoying at 3 is worth enjoying again at 50.  I loved Mary Poppins when it was first released in the theatre, but love it more now with my adult eyes and ears.<br /><br />Mary Poppins is a warm happy tale, but there is also a definite conflict with a strong protagonist: Mr. Banks and pair of antagonists: Mary and Bert.  Together the boyfriend/girlfriend duo of a chimney sweep and nanny assault Mr. Banks' cold harsh sensibilities like a blow torch and teach him that compassion and joy are far more valuable than financial gain.<br /><br />I found the extra pieces in Disc 2 very informative, and they left me wanting to see the stage show.  However, like Karen Dottrice (Jane), I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of the endearing young chap who plays MIchael.<br /><br />The only flaw I saw in the movie then, and now, is that there is not one shot of Mary's beautiful long dark hair down.  If Mary's room is right off the nursery, a shot of her getting up to get Michael and Jane a glass of water (or telling them to quiet down for the night), with her hair in a braid, or completely down, like that of a faerie tale princess,  as she teaches Jane proper hair care, would make Mary more realistic, while at the same time enhancing the charming magic of this timeless tale.<br /><br />When I was a wee damsel, I only had one word for the first movie I ever saw in my life, and that word still holds true:<br /><br />Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Can Never go wrong with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. I loved this movie when I was a teen. Now I enjoy it even more with my grandchildren.
This DVD never gets old to me...I saw it as a little girl and the anniversary addition has lots extra! Worth every penny...and the songs bring back lots of great memories!
You NEED this movie. Kids or no kids, Mary Poppins is a must have movie I love the songs. I love Julie Andrews. I just love this movie.
My grandchildren love it and EVERY Grandparent should keep films like this to entertain the grandchildren<br /><br />Keep the little Angels quiet without a fuss since the actually like this product and will thank you for letting them watch it.<br /><br />The NEVER get tired of watching.
Product came very quickly, in exactly the condition advertised and has brought so much fun to my granddaughter and I..thank you
For its time, this was a creative movie, and they managed to merge the animation in with the live-action scenes pretty well. Keep in mind that this is quite different from the book in some ways, but to be honest, the book is a bit bland compared to the movie. The film has more color, more fantasy, it's pretty awesome, and Julie Andrews does a simply wonderful job as Mary Poppins.
I have loved this movie since I was little now my grandkids love it too
A great movie that was as good now as it was in the 196o's. Perfect gift!
I bought this for my kids ages 6 & 4, and they love it but I am wondering why in 2009 they did not remaster it to HD? A Blu Ray release would have been huge!!!!!!
The product is fine, in good condition.  And I apreciate the sender including a nice note - shows that she cares about what she does and her product.  Thank you.
I have started collecting Disney classic that I watched as a child for my granddaughter.  I enjoy watching them with her.
Who doesn't remember with fondness the film, "Mary Poppins", It's almost a household name. What made this film so special was not only the cleaver casting of Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke; but the immortal soundtrack by the Sherman brothers. This 45th anniversary presentation of the film is as good as it gets. The visual quality is second to none and the sound just as it was in the cinema. It could have been shot today, that's how good this DVD is.<br />With the quality and care of the original filming, Mary is going to be around for many more generations to admire and love. Let's face it, there's a little bit of Mary in all of us. So step in time and step to the store and add it to your collection immediately.<br />Buy it!
I've been slowly replacing my VHS collection, some of which dates back to my childhood, with DVDs.  My old VHS copy of this film had to be from the early 1980's and had been recorded off TV so you can imagine how muddled the quality was.  I was amazed when watching the DVD version at all the detail that I'd missed out on in my old version.  It was like watching a completely different movie at times!  But overall, I love this movie! What's not to love? Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews? They're the best. Plus all those familiar actors and voices from other Disney films of that time period.  The bonus features were fun too.  The DVD arrived in the expected amount of time with the expected overall quality.  I'm very pleased with the vendor, the delivery time and the movie of course!
I saw this movie many moons ago when I was in grade school.  I thought it was a magical, entertaining story.  I bought it for my 2 and 3 year old as something I thought they'd enjoy when they got to grade school.  I was surprised to see them riveted to it for most of the program.  I was doubly surprised they wanted to watch it over and over again!  I'm pretty sure it was the singing and dancing that held their attention.  This is definitely a classic that even little ones will enjoy now!
great movie i got for my grandson to see and own--he loves it and so do i....
Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are just great together.  Bought this for my granddaughters and they have enjoyed watching it along with their grandparents.  A good clean family movie.
Even if you know this film by heart, this DVD is worth it for the extras.  How many classic films from decades past have both stars doing the commentary?  Not to mention Karen Dotrice (who played Jane Banks), who adds another charming touch, and a moving tribute to Matthew Garber, her sibling in the film, who died of complications of Hepatitis acquired while traveling in India.<br /><br />But there's more:  a documentary entitled "Disney on Broadway" provides a fascinating behind the scenes look at the craftsmen who adapted P.L. Travers work to a new venue:  the stage.  While obviously a bit of a puff piece, and there's a whiff of self-congratulation here and there, frankly, much of the pride here is well deserved.  Travers' well known scorn for certain aspects of Disney's film is well known.  How Disney Exec Thomas Schumacher and producer Cameron Macintosh finessed the great dame into giving them the rights makes for interesting viewing.<br /><br />A last point-- so often when we are offered a glimpse behind the scenes, we find out that a magical film wasn't always so magical for those involved in the creation of it.  Not see here.  For everyone involved in this production (and everyone seems charming)  it seems to remain a high point in their lives.  Disney magic indeed.  Don't miss it!
My girls ages 18 mos. and 4 just love this whole story.  They love the songs and it provides great models for children to look up to with great lessons to learn.  The music throughout is wonderful, too, and they love to dance to it.
This was one of my favorite movies when I was growing up.  I am so happy to see that my two sons love it as much as I did.  The whole family now has songs to sing in the car.  This is a great movie for kids of every age.
Mary Poppins is a treat for the whole family.<br /><br />We have 2 little kids and they love it.<br /><br />The songs are timeless and the themes are just as relevant now as when it was made.<br /><br />The special edition is great.
This is a great movie for the family it will put a smile and laughter in everyone.
I got this dvd for my son but I got it for the music I love julie Andrews she always does a great job with what she does it cme in good shape and on time thanks
If you have never seen this movie you live under a rock. I don't think a review is necessary. This is probably the one movie I quote the most. And since I enjoy birds and am currently living in Europe, you can imagine how often "Feed the Birds" comes to mind.
This classic is one I have fond memories of since it was a special treat for us to go see a movie. 45 years ago, when it came out, it was perhaps the first time that actors were combined with animation and it was totally magical for us as kids. My family had never seen it before, so we all enjoyed watching it. The overall feeling you get from watching it is good and I like that. Glad I bought it.
This is Disney's best live-action/animation movie! Better than all of the studio's more recent live-action films (films based on rides are boring and shows a sign of running out of ideas. Teen musicals are a passing fad). Julie Andrews is, of course, "practically perfect" as Mary Poppins. Her voice is excellent on every song she's in. Dick Van Dyke is also brilliant and I applaud him on his Cockney accent. At least he tried compared to other movies that take place in another country and they cast an American (here's looking at you, the most convincing German ever, Tom Cruise). The songs are as memorable as ever. When you're older, you realize how well the songs fit and are relevant to the plot.<br /><br />The features were wonderful to watch (I didn't buy the previous release). And now I'm gonna sidetrack but I'll make it relevant. I'm going to New York and I was planning on what shows to see like Chicago and Mamma Mia! I was planning on doing a Disney one but Little Mermaid seems too implausible to be realized on stage (I also saw a clip of the ending somewhere and it's really lackluster compared to the film. I know it would've been a big budget thing, but still) and for The Lion King, I wouldn't be sucked into the story because I'd be totally aware I'm watching people, not animals, on stage. So that leaves the Mary Poppins adaptation. Judging from the clips on this DVD, THEY TOTALLY SCREWED IT UP! I know you need to adjust it for the stage but they changed to much and added too many new songs. "Practically Perfect" seems to be the only new one to fit. They put the end song of the film at the beginning of the second act and they totally eliminate Uncle Albert. They change Mrs. Banks from a woman's suffrage leader to an actress trying to please her husband! This is one thing Disney should've left as a movie!
This is a really nice movie. My 5 year daughter and 3 year old son love to watch this movie over and over again. This is a true classic that anyone should have in his kids DVD collection.
BEST MOVIE!! Really stands the test of time. Bonus features are great and let you see and listen to music only when you only have time for a little Mary:-)
A different sort of review this, for it invites YOUR participation!<br /><br />Haven't seen MARY POPPINS since 1964, and finally watched it again yesterday. The colors on my VHS copy are vivid and the film's condition quite excellent throughout.<br /><br />Random impressions:<br />Seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful, and Dick Van Dyke without all the shaggy white hair, and Ed Wynn alive and giddy, was an absolute delight!<br /><br />There are SO many songs in this picture! It's practically an operetta.<br />The live action/animation sequences are quite clever.<br />That choreographed chimney sweep number is magnificent!<br />Dick Van Dyke is a helluva dancer, and Julie Andrews keeps right up with him.<br /><br />It's not mentioned in the closing credits that Van Dyke has a dual role: as Mary's friend Bert and Mr. Dawes, the elderly chairman of the bank board.<br /><br />Finally, an invitation to some shared speculation---<br /><br />What exactly IS Mary Poppins? Is she a witch or a spirit made carnate?<br />We initially meet her as she sits on a cloud, powdering her nose. Later, to better see her face she wants a larger wall mirror, then appears within it to sing a duet with and even outdo herself. A third looking glass moment occurs in the chimney sweep sequence-- Mary uses a compact to touch up her dirty face with more soot!<br /><br />Clearly, the young lady is vain. She "hmmph"s when her mirror image outsings her, so she's also jealous, and when she refuses to answer her employer's questions, it shows Mary to be headstrong.<br /><br />So, IS Miss Poppins "practically perfect"? Do all these less-than-ideal personality traits indicate she's human, after all? What do you think? Hit COMMENT below if you'd like to participate!

Pat O'Malley)
The three most most purely astounding things about this 45th anniversary release of Mary Poppins on DVD is how very, very good it looks and sounds, how very young Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke both look - and how terribly shaky his grasp on his Cockney accent really was. In one of the lavish assortment of additional features and interviews, Mr. Van Dyke has sufficient confidence and self-deprecating humor to laugh about this.<br /><br />In watching "Mary Poppins" as an adult, I was also struck by how very much it was a musical showcase for the two stars, a series of elaborate and episodic set-pieces strung together upon the barest thread of plot: a mysterious and charming governess who appears out of the blue, befriending a pair of children whose parents are too taken up by their own interests to pay much attention at all to them at all. At the end, having accomplished this, she vanishes - again, into the blue. In between these two points, the children's adventures are non-stop. Some of them are very strange, such as the long adventure into the chalk pavement painting, and the athletic dancing of the chimneysweeps on the rooftops of London - though for my money, the world of smoky rooftops seems even more unearthly beautiful now than it did ever before. No one could do cityscape matte paintings better than Walt Disney's artists. The picture galleries are always worthwhile on Disney releases, and on this more than any of the others, save perhaps "The Jungle Book". And no other movie can do dancing penguins with more panache - although "Madagascar" does have the edge on doing infiltrating soldier penguins.<br /><br />The extra features are suitably lavish - an all new animated adventure short, about a cat who did more than just look at a king, a look at the Broadway musical version of the chimney-sweep's "Step in Time" dance, and a careful reconstruction of a news feature about the premiere, full of appearances by stars and personalities what will have your children looking at you and saying "Mmm... and they were famous for? When?"
Just recently, I watched this film with my younger sister, who is pretty much obsessed with the whole "High School Musical" phenomenon.  I wanted to show her the musical that defined MY childhood, but wasn't sure how she would react to the dated graphics and themes.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that she found the film to be very entertaining, from the goofy songs to the crazy characters to the wacky animation.<br /><br />In all honesty, though, what is not to like about this charming film?!  The areas in which the movie excels include:<br /><br />Plot: Simple enough (Nanny swoops down from above to take care of somewhat-neglected children) for children to understand, but with just enough political undertones to keep adults' attention, something that does not occur in HSM (in that series, either you buy into the catchy tunes or you don't...there's no middle ground).<br /><br />Acting: Julie Andrews (as Mary Poppins) and Dick Van Dyke (as chimney-sweep Bert) turn in incredible performances that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and there isn't a member of the supporting cast that doesn't bring something interesting to the table.<br /><br />Music: Of course, a musical film is ultimately judged by the success of its musical numbers, and in that case "Mary Poppins" is a rousing success!  It would take too long to rate all the musical numbers in this movie, but suffice it to say that they offer something for everyone.  I personally love the chimney-sweep's "Step In Time" upbeat dance, while my younger sister's favorite was, as she would said, "the one with the dancing penguins!".<br /><br />Overall, "Mary Poppins" is a movie that can be enjoyed by any and all ages from now until the end of time.  Please watch the film to sustain your own craving for nostalgia, then introduce it to your children/relatives to show them that musicals need not be set in high school.

I received a special preview copy of the 40th anniversary of Marry Poppins DVD edition. I must say I spend two whole days reviewing the special features. It is amazing and a must have DVD for the Holidays and all year long.<br /><br />This DVD edition is remastered in the DISNEYS' THX home Theatre set up. The audio is incredible and the restored print is amazing bright, vibrant and textured. The movies are toted as Walt's best achievement ever. And it has everything you would want in a film for the entire family including a break down of sing-a-long songs.<br /><br />40th Anniversary DVD contains:<br /><br />A special audio commentary track with the none other than Academy Award Winning JULIE ANDREWS (The Sound of Music, The Princess Diaries, 10) and DICK VAN DYKE (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Bye Bye Birdie, The Dick Van Dyke Show) themselves. Reminiscing about the music, production and even Mr. Walt Disney himself. Also on the track is Karen Dotrice (Many Lives of Thomasina) who plays young Jane Banks and composer Robert Sherman (All the Disney Classics). They all seem to speak fondly of the shoot, the cast and crew and especially have some funny memories of the production itself.<br /><br />A MAGICAL REUNINION: There is a great walk down "memory lane" with Robert Sherman, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews. They musically review through stories and example of the songs and how the evolution occurred. Dick van Dyke is amazing enthusiastically about his part as Bert. Julie discusses everything from the children to learning about making her very first film ever.<br /><br />THE MAKING OF MARRY POPPINS: Is an amazing visual and educational look at the making of the film. This is the longest of the extra features and goes in depth of the time, energies and efforts into making this Walt Disney classic. Filled with outtakes, behind the scenes footage and commentary from Julie and most of the cast, crew and musical influences of the film. It is hosted by - Dick Van Dyke (Bert) himself!<br /><br />Other features include Dick Van Dyke's original MAKE-UP test, THE GALA WORLD Premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and one of my favorites the DECONSTRUCTION of two scene that include the break down of special effects and animation and their elements being combined.<br /><br />I LOVE TO LAUGH - A game for the kids who have watched the movie and handle some visual trivia from the film.<br /><br />THE CAT THAT LOOKED AT THE KING: Finally there is an extra bonus of a great little new animated short that is from one of the original P.L. Travers books. Julie Andrews herself takes you through the adventure in a very "Marry Poppins" sort of way. Guest voices include David Ogden Stiers (Beauty and the Beast, M.A.S.H., Pocahontas), Tracey Ullman (The Tracy Ullman Show, I Love You To Death, Once Upon A Mattress) and England's own Sarah Ferguson.<br /><br />The film directed by Robert Stevenson  (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Love Bug, The Absent Minded Professor)  is an amazing piece of fun, entertainment and a true lesson in life and the love of family. Richard and Robert Sherman's score, music and songs will leave you singing long after the movie is over! This is an Amazing DVD with tons of extras for the family to enjoy. Sentimental moments, very funny moments and some very heartwarming emotions get this one before it disappears like Marry Poppins herself does! I loved it! (12/04)
Like many folks here, I saw this one when I was very young--right after second grade, I think. By the time it came to the theater in my little rural hometown a year after its release, Julie Andrews had already won an Oscar for her work as the title character.  Not that that mattered.  To the kids in my class at school, this was the hot, must-see movie of that summer--the way "Star Wars" would be in the next decade.  I can still remember laughing over Dick Van Dyke tap-dancing with the penguins and crying during the "Bird Woman" song (which was as much social commentary as a sentimental tune about our feathered friends). I became a fan of Dick Van Dyke's show after this--he basically won my heart as Bert--the jack-of-all-trades special friend to Mary and the Banks' children.  For the rest of that summer, man, I WAS Mary Poppins.  My mom bought me a record of all the songs, I used her old Avon sample case as my carpetbag, and I acted out the movie every day. If VCRs and DVDs had been everyday household items then, I would have asked for "Mary Poppins" for Christmas. (It would have been worn out by Easter, most likely!)<p>As happens to children almost overnight, my interests changed over the next year and I sort of got over my fixation with Mary, Bert, et. al.  After all, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke went on to other things after that, so why not me?  <p>And then in the 90s, Disney re-released "Mary Poppins" as a video.  I bought it for my daughter (or at least that was the excuse I gave my husband).  Though she was too young to understand everything in the movie--just as I was the first time I saw it--she, too, loved "Mary Poppity" as she called it.  We must have played it at least 3 times a week during the first summer we had it, while living in temporary housing and waiting for our house to be built.  She, too, loves to act this one out and to sing the songs for hours on end.  The apple does not fall far from the tree, I guess.<p>As for me. . .it's all I remembered it to be, and then some. For starters, the music. . .what was missing from the old record I had were the overture, underscores, and closing score--they were beautifully put together.  And the little details are delightful, too.  Among them:  Mrs. Banks, who is a feminist (at least when Mr. Banks isn't around) wears bloomers--and later in the movie, we discover Mary Poppins does, too.  (don't blink, or you'll miss seeing them)  The relationship between Mary and Bert. . .as a child I thought they were probably a couple but never had time to see each other because of their work.  Now?  I think they would be a couple if they got a lucky break.  Let's face it--she's a nanny and he's a lower-level tradesman.  Even if they did get married,  in 1910, the realities of British society were such that if you weren't part of the gentry, you worked for a living, and changing your "class" or status didn't happen.  A shame, because their characters obviously love children very much.  So they do the next best thing--work together as a team to bring happiness to British middle-class homes--mainly by shaking up the parents.  Mary was no ordinary nanny, but Bert made her an even better one--he was the idea man, and she handled the implementation. <p>And therein is the secret:  this movie was not as much about Mary, Bert, and the kids as it is about Mary, Bert, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks.  It's when Mr. Banks realizes that his children don't need a nanny to be happy--they just need their parents to love them and give them their attention--that he also becomes the man that the Bank needs.  The scene between Bert and Mr. Banks at the house is one of the best in the movie.  <p>As for the ending?  When I was a child, I didn't understand it.  Now, as an adult, I do.  The mission was accomplished, and it was time to move on.  As one of the main characters said, all was as it should be.<p>So is this movie.  Enjoy it with your own daughter. . .
To date, it is hard to think of a movie that integrated story, character, musical numbers, animation and live action as enchantingly as Mary Poppins.  For children, no other movie provides the sheer exuberance or delightfully  conveyed good messages.  For adults, there is a Puff The Magic Dragon theme  throughout that comes over you when you watch it as a grown-up; I think it  is that twist of sadness and of time passing by that keeps Mary Poppins on  the top of the list.  Julie Andrews is arch perfection in a role she plays  with no sentiment at all; her Mary is as spit-spot and no-nonsense as in  the books; and again, it is that air of authenticity that wins you over --  completely.  Dick Van Dyke displays his many affable talents here in  spades, and the children are absolutely adorable.  The London locations are  a dream come true, and provide a visual backdrop for the adventures at hand  that keeps unfolding with wit and creativity. Though the final scenes in  the bank do drag on a bit, this movie is whisked along by some of the  Sherman Brothers' best music, which conveys not only spirited fun and  frivolity, but also sweet melancholy -- Chim Chim Cheree creeps up on you  by surprise, and at its conclusion you are moved to a place of wistfulness.  Joyful and enduring.
This special edition was most enjoyable. The added video of the musical play adaptation was delightful. It was fun seeing this magical musical classic again after seeing it in the movies when I was a kid. It keeps the young in me. Mary Poppins just keeps the medicine as sweet as ever.
It's 1964 again and I'm 10 years old. This 45th Anniversary edition of Mary Poppins is wonderful. I love it just as much now as I did when I saw it at the movie theatre. I would recommend this DVD to everyone.
This is a wonderful movie and I got it for all of the bonus features.
This is a great family movie. Very funny in all ways. There was nothing I didn't like about it. Great cast of actors. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE AND ALL.  AWANAKARD
After all these years kids still LOVE this movie and whats not to like.<br />Good clean wholesome entertainment. A classic!
This will always be enjoyed by generations to come. Julie Andrews was the perfect choice for Maria. Loved the extras with the film.
Fabulous. If you like singing, dancing, life lessons, and have an imagination this is for you
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VEPRQ">Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)</a>Excellent video; my granddaughter just LOVES it; she has been watching it repeatedly since she received it.  Highly recommend this movie for 3 years and up.
A long-time favoritel; a classic.  Have always wanted to own this movie and am nothing less than ecstatic!  Many thanks!!!!
This is just as charming as it was when I first saw it many years ago!!!<br />It was the part of London  close to my home.
Although I knew all the songs as a child, I do not recall every actually seeing this movie.  (I think I saw it performed as part of Disney on Parade.., does anyone remember that?).<br /><br />So what a delight to watch this DVD with my own kids.  All the songs I remember, and a simple if enjoyable storyline.<br /><br />As a father myself now, the tale of Mr. Banks placing his work before his family is a cautionary one for all working parents.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the old man at the bank..., it's actually Dick Van Dyke!<br /><br />This is Julie Andrew signature role, and it is great to see a move without explosions or violence, just fantasy and fun.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Cheers!
Great movie!  It was so nice to be able to get this somewhere.  My sister loved this as a child and really wanted to get it for Christmas this year.
As a ten year old boy at the theater I was mesmerized buy this wonderful movie.  I remember feeling so excited and thinking this is the greatest film of all time.  As an adult, I reconnect with that child's enthusiasm every time I see Mary Poppins, although the attraction I felt for Julie Andrews is better understood.  There are not enough adjectives to describe it but enchanting stands out.  Unforgettable and a touch of true magic from Disney.  Julie Andrews will always be frozen in time for me and what a fantastic treasure she is.
Disney or not, this is simply Julie Andrews at her very best. Everytime I watch it, I keep thinking how much trouble Mr. Disney had to get the rights to film the project, plus his discovery of Julie in Broadway production of Camelot. They were ready to cast her, but were crossing their fingers for the outcome of the "screentest". Low and behold she took over the cinema screen with a "snap" of a finger.<br />Another comment I might add, is that some might look at the animation sequence as outdated by today's standards, but to follow the story at a closer level, the animation in this movie is about entering a drawn fantasy world via Mary Poppins. The drawing in the story is a pavement picture among many accomplished by an jack of all trades. He even apologizes for any shortcomings his drawings may have to the home audience in mild references. So, with that in mind, it would be out of character (if you will) to have the animation suddenly appear a phenomenal rendering by today's animation standards because in the story it has been drawn by an apologetic part-time artist. And with that, take a better look at that background forest and the architecture of the colorful bridges, they still leave many animators in the country dust!<br />Mary Poppins is, and always will be, Mr. Walt Disney's "crowning achievement". . . make no mistakes.
I bought this DVD for my granddaughter who is 4. She absolutely loves it and has watched it multiple times since receiving it for Christmas. She loves to dance and sing along with the songs. It is a fairly long film and we don't always make it all the way through it.
Julie Andrews was incredible in this. The music is fantastic and it is great for the whole family.<br /><br />Other classics not to forget about are:<br /><br />Mary Poppins<br /><br />My Fair Lady<br /><br />The Wizard of Oz<br /><br />Chitty Chitty Bang Band<br /><br />The first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory<br /><br />The Sound of Music<br /><br />Oliver<br /><br />West Side Story<br /><br />Fiddler on the Roof<br /><br />Singing in the Rain<br /><br />The Wiz<br /><br />Little Mermaid<br /><br />Aladdin<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast<br /><br />Grease<br /><br />The King and I<br /><br />Oklahoma<br /><br />The Music Man<br /><br />South Pacific<br /><br />My Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all! We can't forget about these great musicals!
With full aditional features you can enjoy and remember your chilhood with the olds and greats Julie And Dick.<br /><br />Supercalifragilistiespialidocious.
This is one of the absolute best family movies ever, and has a message that is needed even more in this day and age. Filled with beautiful, memorable songs, and superb performances, Mary Poppins is a gem and a classic. It is enchanting to see how Mary is able to teach a work-a-holic, self-centered, uninvolved father, and a sweet-but-sidetracked mother what their most precious possessions truly are--their children and their family. And Mary does it all so subtly, even magically, that the medicine really does go down with that spoonful of sugar!<br /> Along the way, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) take the children on magical adventures to an English countryside, a tea party on the ceiling, and a chimney sweep's paradise. Dick Van Dyke said that this is the best movie he ever did, and ever hoped to do. I agree with him! A must-have for every family library!!
I saw this movie when I was just a kid and I loved it then. I saw it again now after so many years and I still loved it as much!! This is simply a great classic masterpiece that everyone should see and have!
&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; remains the ultimate Disney musical that both entertains and, in a lighthearted tone, sends a sweet message to children and grown-ups alike. This might sound melodramatic, but anybody who has gotten so deep into the &quot;9 to 5&quot; work routine to the point that they miss the &quot;here and now&quot; could totally relate to this fine work! <p>Such a passionate statement rings true in almost any age; &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a wake-up call, a scathing assault on the mindless conformity that runs rampant in any modern society. I can't hum &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; without also thinking &quot;Protagasubterfugerist et antiphlogistic!&quot; Cheery tunes about nonsensical words indeed mix with angry Greek slogans demanding that the apathetic sloth we call society be energized with the inflammation that is the rising public anger latent in a hollowed culture.<p>Credit for the swift delivery of prosaic force that drives home this angry attack on modern corporate society should go to director Robert Stevenson, who directed many popular Disney films. &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a departure for Stevenson; unlike his &quot;nuclear family&quot; hits like &quot;Son of Flubber,&quot; this body of work reveals a brave soul letting out a Guajardian cry for help. This is most abundant in the melodic tune of discontent disguised as joy &quot;I Love To Laugh,&quot; a symbolic parody revealing that laughing at jokes rife with dark humor spears our souls with a hallucinatory effect, delivering us to heights we may never return from, all while the impoverished starve and the farm animals sicken in the fields. Guajardian musical lyrics have never been better!<p>I can't help but believe this film was a cathartic exercise for Stevenson. Unlike his feelgood movies, this is a focused and consistent work. There is only one other Robert Stevenson film I can think of where he seems to cut deep with his personal creative punch. That 1971 work parallels &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; with its upbeat sardonic songs, but also effectively utilizes surreal gothic imagery, chilling Wiccan chants and disturbing apocalyptic overtones. And while that particular film, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks,&quot; delivers an almost Warholian assault on fascism, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; reigns proudly as the pinochle of Robert Stevenson's body of work.
In early twentieth century London, Michael and Jane Banks have scared off their fourth nanny in six months, when at last the perfect candidate for the job blows into town. This is the central plot to Mary Poppins, a Disney musical comedy, intended to entertain both children and adults.  The father, Mr. Banks, is a banker, very precise, and a bit of a martinet.  The mother, Mrs. Banks, is a suffragette. The two children wish for something better, and Mary Poppins is the answer to their wish.  She leads them through a number of adventures and introduces them to many people before she influences their father's approach to family life.  In the movie, children are encouraged to use their imagination while parents are reminded what it is like to be a child again thus bringing the family closer.<p>  The first outing the children experience with Mary Poppins is to the park.  The children do not think it would be fun, but they are in for a big surprise.  Jane and Michael encounter Bert, a sidewalk chalk artist.  The children show interest in one of the drawings so Bert has the children use their imaginations as if they were in one of them.  He pretends to ride a boat in one of the pictures using sound effects with his mouth and his walking stick.  Another drawing is of a tightrope walker in which he once again pretends to be in the drawing.  This makes the children feel they are there at the events.  Then Bert tries to make the children think they can go into a chalk drawing by having them "Think, wink, double blink, close your eyes and jump."  Since that did not work, Mary Poppins stepped in to help everyone experience the chalk drawing.  Mary Poppins and Bert took the children into animated landscapes where penguins tap dance, barn animals talk, merry-go-round horses participate in horse races, and umbrellas talk.  The children come into a fantasy world where everything around them is perfect.  Michael and Jane were encouraged to use their imaginations to get them there.  <p>  All throught the movie, Mr. Banks is very cold, uptight, stern, and course.  He has forgotten about the simple joys and pleasures of life.  The father is only interested in his job, money, and running the house.  "I'm the lord of my castle the sov'reign, the liege!  I treat my subjects: servants, children, and wife with firm but gentle hand noblesse oblige!"  For him, there is no time for fun and games.  While Mr. Banks is lecturing Mary Poppins he says, "And popping through pictures have little use, fulfil no basic need, they've got to learn the honest truth despite their youth."  <p>  Towards the end of the movie, Bert helped Mr. Banks realize that ever since Mary Poppins came into his life she was a positive influence, he just didn't see it.  After the children give him their tuppins, his eyes open up to the world and he realizes money and work are not the most important things in life.  Once he loosens up, he gets a position at the bank, became closer with his family, and developes an outgoing and fun side to him.  Therefore his life improves because he let the child inside him come out and be a kid once again.  <p> Mary Poppins is a nanny extraordinaire who enriches the lives of everyone she encounters.  All throughout the movie there is never a dull moment; she and the children are constantly out exploring life and living each day to the fullest.  Mary Poppins makes every chore a game and every day a &quot;Jolly Holiday&quot;.  She, Bert and the children have a number of magical adventures, which eventually bring the children closer to their busy parents.  Mr. Banks is at first shocked by Mary's bizarre excursions; he would rather his children act like little adults.  But he soon learns that children's games are good for everyone, and ended up leading his family on a kite-flying expedition.  Mary Poppins encourages both children and parents to use their imaginations to enrich the life of a family.
This is the first Disney film released after I was born.  I got into this film because of the music.  It is perfect!!  Both Julie Andrews &amp; Dick Van Dyke were perfect in their roles.  Notice I use the word perfect as it was in the film.  Glad there are extras on the disc, surprising. ...
Forty years old and still practically perfect in every way! Even at 2hr.s, 20 min. "Mary Poppins" remains Walt Disney's crowning technical and artistic achievement; an effervescent eclectic blend of animation/live action and special effects that idyllically encompasses P.L Travers' enchanting best seller. Julie Andrews' London stage performance in `Camelot' so impressed Disney that he immediately began talks to secure her talents for his film. By the time shooting began, Andrews was playing Eliza on stage in `My Fair Lady'. That she was casually looked over for the lead in the film version of that play remains a mystery. But Lady's loss was Poppin's gain.<br /><br />Andrews delights in the title role as the too good to be true nanny with just enough playful larceny lurking beneath her properly quaffed locks and bonnet. She arrives to take charge of the Bank's household and whip them into shape; wife Winifred (Glynis John), husband George (David Tomlinson) and their two children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice). Seems Jane and Michael have been giving the previous nannies a hard time. Actually, they're just a pair of lonely kids who desire the love and attention of their stoic dad. A lowly chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) helps provide Mary and the children with one of those supercalafragalisticexpialadocious bits of escapism set to magic; a fantastic frolic in the country complete with carousel ride, fox hunt and horse races. Yikes, tally-ho! There's so much to admire and celebrate in this perennial classic that it's best left to the home viewer to pop this one in for a jolly holiday of a good time!<br /><br />Disney's deluxe, 2-disc DVD is a genuine treat. At long last, anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions, the transfer is generally quite smooth and solid for image quality that will surely please. Colors are rich and vibrant. Blacks are solid and deep. Whites are generally clean. Occasionally there is a hint of age related artifacts as well as some minor pixelization that breaks apart some of the background information, but these distractions are kept to a bare minimum. The audio is a brand new, and very engaging, 5.1 mix for the home theatre aficionado. Extras include the all new 50 min. documentary on the making of the film that is quite comprehensive. There's also some self congratulatory audio commentaries and `A Musical Journey' with composer, Richard Sherman. The rest of the extras are typical Disney catering to the tot's fanfare; a trivia game, special effects junket and some music video and short subject stuff. All in all this is a very nicely packed special edition from the Disney stable and one that's been long overdo. So get out your umbrella or go fly a kite; because "Mary Poppins" is shear magic for the young and young at heart!
this was the first time ive purchaced anything from amazon and i was very impressed . my items arrived before i expected and although i purchaced the used products, you wouldnt have knowen. everything looked new .
Mary Poppins is a Walt Disney classic. Julie Andrews plays the title role and she won an Oscar for her flawless performance. Andrews is pure delight, wish I had a nanny like her as a youngster. Dick Van Dyke is a gem as well, great songs and dance numbers. Mary Poppins is a family treasure to be enjoyed over and over again. I highly recommend it.
During the 90's Disney flicks were lame, drippy musicals. This is not the case with Mary Poppins. The songs are still fresh and vibrant. As a whole this is the most re-watchable musical flick ever, so I'm happy to have it in DVD. Highly recommended to adults, even those that were put off Disney by "The Little Mermaid" and the rest of the Eisner era dreck-to-theater.<br /><br />However, I have to admit that from a technical point of view, Mary Poppins shows its age. The blend between humans and cartoons is not that good, so you have to try harder to keep your disbelief suspended.<br /><br />Anyway, it has great nostalgic value for me. Perhaps kids might like it, too... I'll show it to my little nephews and tell you later.
A great deluxe treament to an equally great film. Julie Andrews in her first film is just spellbinding as "Mary Poppins". The DVD has a great transfer and a load of interesting extras. One of Disneys finest moments.
The children that watched this movie really enjoyed it!! The adults that<br /><br />watched knew what was coming next and really enjoyed it again!!!
The DVD arrived in perfect condition and the DVD with all the additional information about it's making was a pleasant surprise. The movie itself was thoroughly enjoyable would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in fine acting, dancing, singing and most of all flying.
This edition of Mary Poppins is amazing. I never thought i'd learn so much from a commentary, lol. The shipping was amazingly quick as well. The condition of the entire package was excellent!
This is my favorite musical of all time. It's wonderfully done, and the story is excellent. Julie Andrews did a great job in her first ever cinematic role, she plays a magical nanny that comes to a rich man's house in order to bring the family back together. What I love about her performance is that she looks very confident and so straight forward and firm, not as playful as you may think. The film also has Dick Van Dyke in the role of Bert, who is a very good friend of Mary Poppins and also handles magic very well. That role was funny and very entertaining(the accent is a bit confusing though), and i loved all of his dance numbers, especially Step In Time, the dance on the roof-top. Another excellent performance was David Tomlinson, who did the role of George Banks, the father of the children. He is very firm and strict, but he can also be very clumsy and forgetful, which is another reason I liked him. His song The Life I Lead was also great. This film was prized with five well-deserved Academy Awards, for the excellent Film Editing, the Visual Effects, like the jump into the pavement picture, the tea party on the ceiling and the smoke ladder, the excellent score, the song Chim Chim Cheree, which may have not been the best song, but one of them had to win, and last but not least, the excellent (oscar-winning) performance by Julie Andrews. I cannot find any more words for this film, so I'll leave you with one word. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
After being passed over for the role of Eliza Doolittle for the film version of MY FAIR LADY (the role she created on Broadway) for the more "loverly" but less vocally-skilled Audrey Hepburn, Andrews was recruited for Mary Poppins personally by Walt Disney who offered the role to her on the spot after seeing her in CAMELOT. Once given a chance to prove her screen presence she managed to turn in a number of very memorable and diverse film roles, though she is mostly remembered for her two singing nanny roles, Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp.<br /><br />The 40th Anniversary DVD set of MARY POPPINS s chock full of interesting extras--interviews with Andrews and VanDyke, making-of featurettes, a game, etc. I found the black and white archival footage of the Hollywood Premier to be especially fascinating. Although there is nothing critical of the movie, the Disney studios, or Disney the man in these extras--and you do feel a bit manipulated into a sense of awe--MARY POPPINS was a great achievement that took Disney many years to pull off. You can't really begrudge the man his bragging rights. (In the trivia track of the movie, the studio is quick to assert that if the initial box-office take were recalculated based on current ticket prices, MP would be the top grossing film of all time, out-performing THE LORD OF THE RINGS, etc.).<br /><br />The DVD extras also helped me to understand things about the movie that have always bothered me. The music, though catchy in its own way, is consciously composed based on elements of the British music hall which I think accounts for their slightly cold, alien quality (As an American unconsciously influenced by African-American and jazz idioms, I think my ear naturally craves minor chords and more complex rhythms). Also, the featurettes reveal that the books the movie was based on were really a collection of amusing stories rather than novels with beginnings, middles and ends. It was the Disney writers who consequently had to provide the overarching story line. And in bizarre and typical Disney fashion (who in their 50s today was not traumatized by the death of Bambi's mother? or Dumbo's separation from Jumbo?), it pivots on child abandonment issues. I remember seeing MP 40 years ago and being very upset by how blithely Mary floated out of the children's lives after having worked her magic--no promise to send post cards, visit once a year on their birthdays, or attend their graduations. True, she functioned as a catalyst in the life of the children's family and was responsible for turning the neglectful, business-obsessed father and women's-suffrage-obsessed mother into caring and attentive parents, but that does little to offset the bittersweet sadness of seeing Mary lift off and float out of the young children's lives forever. I remember thinking at the time, "She was just pretending to like the kids all along. Looking after them was just a job for her. How cold!"<br /><br />The true achievement of MARY POPPINS, however, was the way Disney combined animation with live action, something we probably take for granted today. Perhaps because it was harder to do this "back then", such sequences were well thought out in MP and never seem gratuitous. To those people who don't like to be shown "how it's done" and want to preserve the mystery, I would say, just ignore the "extras" disk. But I found the "how to" stuff fascinating--especially Ed Wynn's laughing tea party scene and the phenominal chimney sweepers rooftop dance number.<br /><br />The Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is worth the purchase price. You'll find yourself watching the movie AND the extras disk many times over.
My 2 year old son and I love the film.  Nevertheless, this DVD is in widescreen "letterbox" format, not anamorphic format like the description says.  For those of you who care, this DVD is *not* enhanced for 16x9 televisions.  Maybe the Platinum Edition will be?  Let's hope!
I think this review will be of interest to most people. I'm one of the few people who never saw "Mary Poppins" as a child. You read that right. I saw it recently for the first time on DVD and here are my impressions of it: firstly, I don't know if I enjoyed this film as much as I would have if I had first seen it as a child. The movie is clearly intended for kids. Yet the film has a wonderful, infectious quality to it. You don't have to be a kid to appreciate it. "Mary Poppins" is a truly unforgettable film. It has so many things going for it. First is Julie Andrews, who won an Oscar for Best Actress as Mary herself, and who demonstrates supreme self-confidence in this her first starring role.  The film also won an Oscar for Best Special Effects in 1964; the technology to combine live-action footage with animation has since been surpassed (notably in "Who framed Roger Rabbit?") but it's never been used more effectively than here: that wonderful sequence where Dick Van Dyke dances with a quartet of animated penguins still holds up forty years after it was filmed. Unquestionably, however, the film's greatest asset is its musical score by the Sherman brothers and that score is simply a knockout. Songs like "A Spoonful of Sugar" and "Jolly Holiday" are instant classics; once you hear them you will never forget them. And a song like "Feed the Birds" about the old woman who sits on the steps of St. Paul's cathedral and sells bags of crumbs to feed the birds is truly affecting ("though her words are simple and few/ Listen, listen, she's calling to you..."). I don't see how anyone can hear a song like that and fail to be touched by it. The film does have its problems: the film's plot is relatively slight: basically, an oblivious and paternalistic father learns to stop being so oblivious and paternalistic.  Indeed, the film's plot comes off as a kind of ad hoc improvisation by the film's creators, just an excuse to string together a series of otherwise-unrelated episodes. Also, the character of Mary has, to my mind, a fundamental flaw (inherited, I believe, from the source material itself, i.e. Pamela Travers' books). It's never really explained why Mary is magical as opposed to any of the other characters.  Apparently, we're just supposed to accept it on principle that Mary Poppins is magical because the movie says she is and then work backwards from that proposition. But all things considered these objections are relatively minor.  The movie generates such joy and good feeling that these things really win the day. One last point: I was aware, prior to having seen the film, that it had gotten a bad rap as "treacle", "syrupy-sweet", etc. Not true. What "Mary Poppins" is is wholesome. It has a simplicity and an innocence to it that you just don't see in movies nowadays. Perhaps we live in a more cynical time. Pity.
I first saw this film in the theater, on it's premiere.  If I'm not mistaken, it was a very early multiplex in Los Angeles.  Of course I was captivated.  I saw it again, over the years, on T.V., "Wizard Of Oz" style, with commercials, although the ads never seemed to attach themselves to film the way they did with the "Wizard", where I can still identify the scenes where the commercials are due.<br /><br />Then, as I grew up, and older, I aquired a more jaded view of "Mary Poppins", and ignored it for more than a decade.  And, fairly recently, I happened upon "Mary Poppins" on T.V., and realized that my memories were not accurate.<br /><br />It was not the repulsive '60s musical, ala "Sound Of Music", with the obnoxiously blonde, dreadfully perfect, aryan, children; but a wonderfully escapist piece, with bytes of subversiveness, referring to suffragettes, and a woman's place in Edwardian society, and what they were doing about it;  a subversiveness that "SOM" completely lacked, even with it's much darker Nazi overtones.  Can I strangle those brats with the drapes, now?<br /><br />But lately, in watching the film, I notice that Cherry Tree Lane was all too awfully, a harbinger of the banal suburban housing tracts that dominate our lost farmlands and suburban sprawl, today.  One can see the imprimatur of Disneyland, and Disneyland Culture, all over this film, except that, when it debuted, this clarion call was not a part of the film that any, but the most clear headed, and most strident activists would have picked up.<br /><br />Oh my.<br /><br />But don't let that deter you, this is a wonderful film.  This is a product from an era when Disney was a film maker, and not the metaphor of all that went wrong with American society.  It was, after all,  our fellow Americans that took the message to heart, and made a mess out of it.  Don't let them screw it up for you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for escapist entertainment, and I won't even feed a pidgeon, even in the company of children! (They're wild animals, like the Parrots of Telegraph Hill, and Chicago...)<br /><br />This is a fine film.  Watch it.
when i got the movie it was broken they called me when i left a review and asked what was wrong and they fixed the problum they are a good compiny!
There's no need to write another review of this splendid film.  This is only to wonder at the one part of the film and all the commentary on the 40th anniversary edition that confuses me: the film takes place in England, but the audiotronic bird shown in one scene is the American robin, a thrush, and similar to the English robin only in color, not species.  OK, the film was for American audiences, no problem with that -- but there is no mention in any of the commentary about the discrepancy.  The only thing said about the robin -- besides the audiotronic information -- is that male robins don't sing!  I believe that is totally incorrect, for the American thrush called robin, as well as for the English robin.  (I'll watch this space for a correction from any ornithologists out there...)
My daughter was as engaged by movie as quickly at 3 as I was at 3!  What a wonderful classic that we can share!
The price was fair.  Works fine and arrived on time.  I'm happy with it.<br />This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon.
Product was as advertised. Our young granddaughters enjoy it very much. There are a number of bonus features, not all of which we have had time to explore. One falw is that when one selects a segment to view, it proceeds on to the rest of the DVD after the desired segment is completed.
Our daughter is 4 and she enjoys this movie.  She loves songs and we thought Mary Poppins would be a great movie to watch.  For example, she also loves Sound of Music songs.  To be fair, its hard to maintain the attention of a 4 year old and she doesn't quite get the whole story, so after a couple of attempts, we just use the section of the DVD that plays only the songs.  Its like a video jukebox.<br /><br />I think when she is older, she can appreciate the story more but the dancing and singing sequences are still very entertaining.  They are dated but still classic.
The 'Nanny' kids need to help survive their chaos- who'll always BE THERE for them, to help the "medicine go down".
I bought this as a birthday gift but now I wish that I had kept it for myself!  Oh, Well!!  Mary Poppins is truly a classic... and so am I!!!
Mary Poppings is a movie for the whole family. It is fun and holds adventure that all can enjoy. Have fun watching.
Mary Poppins is one of the best movies ever made and it's appealing to all ages and sexes.
I hadn't seen this movie since it came out.  Enjoyed it every bit as much as I did the first time.
I had seen Mary Poppins as a child so I already knew what the movie was about before I purchased it. I now have a child and want him to enjoy some of the same classics I enjoyed when I was a child. I love this movie and I know he will too!
Classic safe children's entertainment.  Great for mixed aged kids.  No violence. No potty talk.  The gold standard for kids under 9.
Is there no better movie out there than Mary Poppins. With stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you are assured of great acting and music. Dick Van Dyke for me is one of the greates actors of all times, especially when you're talking his earlier works like this and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. His songs and acting are all fun and exciting.<br /><br />The special effects on this is definitely outdated by our standards but were cutting edge way back when.<br /><br />If you have kids, this will be worth your time. They love the way at the end when the kids take over the castle and put the 'Child Catcher' in the big net. He always disturbed me as a child, just something about the way way his face was made up. He has the same effect on my daughter as the Oompa Loompas of the orignal Wonka movie.
My 4 year old son, 2 1/2 year old son and 1 year old daughter all enjoy this film.  They mainly enjoy the singing but my 4 year old is able to get some of the jokes.  A nice video for family movie night since it is not scary or too fast paced.
The Banks family is in need of a new nanny for Jane and Michael.  Fortunately, one arrives on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins.  She's everything the kids want, fun and magical.  But while she's taking them to chalk painting countrysides and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less then happy.  Can he be made to see beyond the end of his nose?<br /><br />Ok, so this movie is really little more then an excuse for song and dance numbers.  It's still great!  The plot is paper thin, and you loose site of it in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes.  Of course, part of that is because the movie is based on a book that is really nothing but short stories.  Still this movie is more about fun then anything else.  And it has that in spades.  What kid wouldn't have fun imaging that they get to do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie?<br /><br />It's said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned into making this film, and it shows.  Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today.  There were some I still hadn't figured out until watching this special edition.  And the music!  Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart.  And you can't help but find yourself humming "A Spoonful of Sugar," "Jolly Holiday," "Let's Go Fly a Kite," or "Chim Chim Cher-ee" for days after seeing it.<br /><br />Those wanting to own a great DVD of this film won't be disappointed in this two-disc set.  Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory.  I can't see how it's ever looked better.  The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will blow you away.  It's fantastic.  There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane), and Richard Sherman.  Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself.  Also included are some pop up facts to read along with while watching the movie.  Disc two features a new documentary on the film, a deleted song, and more on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers.  And be sure to check out the animated "The Cat That Looked at a King," a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series.<br /><br />One thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney.  The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius.  With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come.
We are a 3 generation Mary Poppins family.  I saw it as a young child--when it first came out, grew up with the MP music books and repeated viewings of Mary Poppins.<br /><br />I ordered the VCR tape approximately 20 years ago at a premium price.  I am still using it.  My 3 sons grew up with Mary Poppins, learning each and every line to the songs and script.  They played "Mary Poppins".  Now my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter is the biggest fan--2-3 times a day the video is viewed.  I purchased 2 sets of the DVDs as well as the music CDs for 2004 Christmas. Our granddaughter sings to the music, knows each scene and hushes us as not to miss a particular song. She does the Spit-Spot mirror scene-hand gestures and all!<br /><br />Mary Poppins--is wonderful!
This is the third DVD release of the Disney classic, and the studio's current technology has given us a print that probably looks better than it did in 1964 - not a scratch to be found anywhere.  The first DVD release presented a copy of the movie that showed little or no remastering at all, with a faded image and sound to boot.  Everything looked and sounded much better in the second release, the first to use 5.1 audio. But anyone watching the present DVD for the first time should appreciate all the work done during the immaculate restoration.  The image is incredibly sharp, bringing out even the smallest freckles on Julie Andrews' face.<br /><br />Audio selections are varied on this new disc, including a French and a Spanish track, and three English tracks.  The sound is a marvel in 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix - what a treat!  However, this "Mix", and the 2.0 version of the mix, sounds somewhat blurred when heard on TV speakers.  A good test is when the chorus enters during the main title sequence, singing "Chim Chim Cher-ee".  Normally, the chorus is up front and focused, but with the Enhanced Mix on TV they tend to be behind the already distanced orchestra.  For TV speakers only, viewers are encouraged to choose the Original 2.0 Theatrical Mix, which sharpens the sound considerably.<br /><br />Extras are very fun and informative.<br /><br />One of the best DVD's of the year.
This edition of Mary Poppins will captivate you and entertain you to no end! GRIN Finally, a QUALITY two DVD set of this awesome classic Disney picture! I remember seeing Mary Poppins when I was much younger and this release does not disappoint! It is loaded with extras and the quality of the picture and sound is excellent!<br /><br />The plot of the movie involves Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, a magical nanny who becomes the governess of the Banks children who have a stuffed shirt father. (By the way, this part is similar to the role Julie would play the following year as Maria in The Sound of Music.) How Mary finds out about the job is in itself magical since the father of the Banks children had thrown away the letter they wrote asking for a nanny! We never get to know where she came from, either! Mary uses her love and natural powers to bring joy to the Banks children without ever being too overbearingly "preachy." Later on in the movie the father is faced with the possible loss of his job and the moral of the story is delivered to the audience in a very well done fashion.<br /><br />The acting is superlative and the musical numbers are unforgettable. To this day "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" remains an extremely catchy song and the other songs like "Chim Chim Cher-ee" and "A Spoonful of Sugar" are completely enchanting!<br /><br />But there's more! This DVD set is loaded--and I mean loaded--with valuable extras that will entertain you and raise your understanding of how the film was made as well as its history. For example, there's "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins" - a new 50-minute documentary, footage of the "Gala Movie Premiere," and a make up test for Dyke Van Dyke. There are songs and games for children (and the children in us), too!<br /><br />After you see this you will understand why the movie got Julie Andrews a Best Actress Oscar (in her film debut, no less) and why Dick Van Dyke is so talented and perfect for his role as Mary's boyfriend. (Look for Van Dyke also in the role of the senior officer of the bank!) All together the film received 13 Oscar nominations including Best Song for "Chim Chim Cher-ee!" Although some of the technical effects are not the state of today's art, the film did receive Oscar awards for technical effects and music. Simply put, I highly recommend this two DVD set for Disney fans, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke fans, and fans of musicals. This edition of Mary Poppins will not disappoint!
The all-new 40th Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is definitely a must-own for all fans of the movie, and has been well worth the wait.  As the editorial review states, this is the third DVD of MARY POPPINS to be released.  The last edition (on the Gold Classics label) featured a great print but scant extras and fans simply knew that the Disney company should have done a better job remastering and releasing one of their most beloved films.  Our prayers have been answered!<br /><br />This brand-new MARY POPPINS features a state-of-the-art new digital restored print (similar to that done on the SNOW WHITE Platinum Edition), and a veritable carpetbag-full of extra features, the big highlight being an audio commentary by Dame Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Karen Dotrice among others.<br /><br />It is indeed a thrilling movie experience.  Out of the dreary London skies soars Mary Poppins, who sets about restoring the love and friendships in the fractured Banks family.  Along the way Mary leads us through many magical adventures including a 'Jolly Holiday' inside a pavement chalk picture, a tea party on the ceiling with Uncle Albert and a dance on the rooftops with Bert and his chimney-sweep pals.<br /><br />Other 'Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious' extras include a sequence deleted from the picture ("Chimpanzoo"), to an all-new retrospective documemtary with interviews with all the surviving lead cast-members.  Julie Andrews (who has renewed her ties to the Disney family with her role as Queen Clarisse in the PRINCESS DIARIES films) also has a lovely chat with Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman as they reminisce about making the movie.<br /><br />If you own the earlier DVD edition and think you've seen MARY POPPINS think again!  This all-new 40th Anniversary tribute is the ultimate testament to this magical Disney masterpiece!  Buy it today!
Julie Andrews won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Actress in this delighful musical adaptation of the popular British children's books. And deservedly so. From the moment she descends from the sky as Poppins and lands on the front steps of Jane and Michael Bank's home, there's absolutely no stopping her. Here, as in the many films she would make over the next five decades, Andrews graps hold of a part, takes it that extra mile and never once disappoints.  As Poppins, she is magnificent. But there's more to the part than just singing about tea parties on the ceiling, popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures or spoonfuls of sugar. Sure, she's the nanny we'd all love to have. But in the story, her character arrives just in the knick of time to put a dysfunctional family back together in true Disney fashion. The songs are great. In particular, &quot;Chim-Chim Cheree,&quot; &quot;Spoonful of Sugar,&quot; &quot;I Love to Laugh&quot; and &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpalidocious.&quot; The rest of the cast, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice, Glynis Johns, David Tomlinson, Matthew Garber and Ed Wynn, also add to the fun. Hard to believe that it's been 37 years since this film was first released. Nontheless, it's just as entertaining as it was way back when. It's also fun to sit back and watch a whole new generation of kids and their parents discover the magic and wonder of this terrific Disney film. Rent it today. Or Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
Wonderful Disney film in a perfect WIDESCREEN DVD release.  Note to Disney Home Video:  PLEASE release all films in their original theatrical ratios like this!  Audio  quality of this DVD is excellent.
After two lackluster DVD releases, Disney finally gave one of their most beloved and most popular films a dazzling DVD treatment for its 40th Anniversary.<br /><br />The transfer for this movie is nothing short of breathtaking. No grain, no film flaws, nothing of the sort. Colors are vibrant, the audio is clear and crisp, and it's the best this movie's ever looked or sounded. The songs will sound nothing short of spectacular while special effects sequences will still be as magical as ever.<br /><br />The bonus features are excellent and this DVD boasts some of the best bonuses ever for a non-Platinum Disney DVD. You have an INCREDIBLE making-of documentary that totally goes in-depth and is not at all fluffy. The short The Cat That Looked At A King is charming and a wonderful watch. The Musical Reunion and Musical Journey featurettes are both charming to watch. There's lots of footage from the world premiere, still art galleries, publicity materials, and more.<br /><br />In addition to this DVD, Disney also released a 2-CD Special Edition soundtrack. Disc 1 boasts the most complete soundtrack album ever available. Disc 2 contains all kinds of bonus materials. The packaging and content is truly excellent.<br /><br />I can't find any fault with this DVD or the Special Edition soundtrack. I definitely recommend both with full enthusiasm.
This 40th anniversary edition of "Mary Poppins" is absolutely fabulous.  The picture quality and new soundtrack in 5.1 is stunning.  A far better picture/sound than in the previous two issues.  I even watched disc 2, and I never watch the second disc.  It features one deleted song, and it was rather charming.  Other features include jumping to a song, or just watching all the songs with optional subtitles.  This is a great feature if you are trying to teach your kids those wonderful, loving songs.  This is one of the best discs Disney has ever put out, and its about time that "Mary Poppins" gets the same treatment as any other "Vault Classic."
There's a stretch of Mary Poppins, from around "The Perfect Nanny" until "I Love to Laugh," that really is perfect.  Pure magic.  But then that ending just drags and drags.  The beauty of the movie, during that enchanting middle section, is that it is spirited and breathtaking, and delivers a message without being preachy.  But then, shortly after the gang find themselves laughing to the point that they float to the ceiling, the energy starts to leak out of the movie.  I appreciate that attention spans were longer a generation ago.  But, two hours and twenty minutes for a children's musical?  Could anyone- even back then- have really wanted to watch more of the Banks father being emasculated?  There is "Chim Chim Cher-ee" and "Step in Time" to break up the heavy handed morality, and then Mr. Banks' rebirth as a `quality-time' father is demonstrated briefly by his interest in kites.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm down with the messages: The pursuit of money and status doesn't guarantee happiness.  Don't forget to appreciate and nurture your kids.  You don't have to sacrifice limit-setting to be playful, and so on.  But there's something annoying about having that message remastered, repackaged, and forcefully delivered by the encroaching, ubiquitous Disney colossus.<br /><br />Mary Poppins does a tremendous piece of family therapy with the Banks.  While one can find elements of structural family therapy in her work, she mainly uses a strategic approach, focusing less on insight and understanding and instead adopting a directive and authoritative stance to manipulate the elements of symptoms, metaphors, hierarchy, and power that form the secret language of the Banks family.  In fact, there is no better illustration of a paradoxical intervention than when she sings the lullaby "Stay Awake."  The late Jay Haley himself must have marveled at her technique.  And it is a wonderful talent that allows Mary Poppins the character, as well as Julie Andrews the actress, to act in an authoritarian manner while projecting enough playfulness and charm to secure the alliance with not just the kids but the parents.  Magic doesn't hurt the transference either.<br /><br />Anyway, the stuff that's great is really priceless and well worth it.  You should probably slog through the movie all the way at least once, perhaps in a few sittings, but then after that you can select to view just the musical numbers with the kids.  Some of the behind-the-scenes bonuses are worth watching.  It's always interesting to see how the creative process works, the little serendipitous moments that add up to brilliance.<br /><br />I think I'm done.  I managed to get through this review without saying "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."  By the way, "dociousaliexpilisticfragicalirupus" is not strictly speaking the same word backwards.  They throw in that "rupus" at the end to throw us off, but the rest of it is made up of roots, some of them multisyllabic, intact but in reverse order.  Just wanted to mention that.
The online streamed version of this movie is NOT widescreen. It is pan & scan and looks like a low-quality YouTube video circa 2003. I did a bandwidth speedtest showing 10 Mbps download but Amazon's video connect shows 1 of 5 bars, so their video server cannot handle decent quality video. Refund please.
First let me say that I like this movie. I'm British by birth so I am duty bound to deduct one star for the most unsuccessful attempt at a British accent ever to be immortalized on film. It shows how much the standard of acting has improved when you hear the flawless British accents of actors like Rene Zellweger or Johnny Depp. Dick Van Dyke simply can't do a British accent and should never have been cast in the part. There was a British actor/singer at the time called Tommy Steele, who already had an impressive stage and screen resume and who would have been perfect in the role. However, he was overlooked for the bigger name (in the US) of Van Dyke. Ironically, Julie Andrews was passed over a year earlier for the movie of 'My Fair Lady' for the non-singing, but better-known, Audrey Hepburn (whose cockney accent was almost as bad as Van Dyke's). Andrews showed what a mistake that was by winning an Oscar for this film. However, that quibble aside, this is a joyous, entrancing movie.<br /><br />The funny thing I referred to in the title of this review is that in most movie adaptations of books, like say the Harry Potter series, angry reviewers spend much time and energy complaining that the movies don't follow the books. Hardly anyone (I did find one such review) says that about 'Mary Poppins', even though the movie bears little resemblance to the book and, in particular, the character of Mary Poppins is completely changed.<br /><br />Personally, I've never felt that movie adaptations need to follow the books on which they were based. Movies are a totally different medium and the only criterion should be whether the movie works as a movie. In that respect, 'Mary Poppins' works admirably.
A delightful movie the whole family will enjoy. July Andrews sure did earn her Academy award.
I wasn't raised as a Disney kid, so I was only peripherally aware of this film growing up, maybe saw some of it on TV a time or two, but never in the movie theatres or from start to finish.<br /><br />Recently, however, my kid and I read the first four "Mary Poppins" books and were thoroughly charmed by their odd, acerbic humor. So I thought, hmmmm, maybe we should try the movie as well, even though I knew, vaguely, that the Julie Andrews MP was much different than the mysterious faerie-nanny we had come to know from the books. Although the Disney Poppins isn't entirely sugary-sweet, she is much more benevolent and feel-good than the grouchy, cross nanny in the books. Also, though I love Dick Van Dyke dearly, having his character Bert in the film from start to finish is a big change (Bert only appears in two or three stories in the books) and he often overwhelms the rest of the film.  The Banks family is also greatly altered - instead of a spaced-out humbug, the father becomes a foreboding, socially retrograde prig, while the mother (also a space cadet in the books) is made more sympathetic, a foil for the crabby dad. (And the interjection of her being politically active, as a  voting rights suffragette, seems oddly out of place: the books were never about the parents, and they are made much more central here...)<br /><br />There is some innovative animation and creative, imaginative visualizing of the story, but far too many alterations and new material created out of whole cloth to suit a "Mary Poppins" purist, which I guess I am.  Since we love the books so much, I previewed this film alone, and I think I'll hold off for a few years before we give it a whirl as a family: I really think it would ruin the magic of the Travers text, and replace it with something much simpler, much cheaper, and far less wondrous. (ReadThatAgain book reviews)
I can never remember.  Julie Andrews sang a little song about "pouring out" when this first came out, but Disney cut most of the running tea gags on re-release -- so the whole teapot etiquette scene on Uncle Albert's ceiling is missing.  Maybe Juan Valdez slipped Mickey a little something under the table?<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke's ersatz cockney accent seems to have aged severely over the decades, although Uncle Albert is now clearly bipolar.  Four stars.  If Eisnerville ever re-releases the original, with the tea jokes intact, it might be a five again.
Mary Poppins is a wonderful tale which combines the very talented Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. It is a great story for both young and old. However this DVD is not what I expected although there were a few extras such as a game and a very brief making of documentary, it was not as indepth as some of the other Disney DVD's on the market. So its thumbs up for the film and a thumbs down for the DVD as a whole.
I don't feel qualified to review because it is laying where I placed it after I received it.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JRB16U">Mary Poppins (Two-Disc 45th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>  Looks great from outside of the package and it came as Amazon promised.
Purchased this for my grown daughter - VHS just doesn't cut it - by the time a new format comes out - she'll have to buy her own
The DVD came in perfect condition and it came almost right away.  What more could a person ask for?
Seller was very prompt in sending my order.  DVD arrived in perfect condition!  Impressive.
Good delivery time, in time for Christmas and was ordered last minute.  Great condition-brand new in package.
Our family loves this movie.  We had it in VHS, then we got it in DVD.
The DVD arrived timely, was bought at a very fair price, was in perfect condition, and has been enjoyed several times by grandchildren.
everything went smooth. I got the movie when I should have and it was flawless.
It took me 40 years before I finally saw this film, in December 2004 shortly after it had come out with a two-disc DVD. After the first half hour I thought, "Wow, I can see why this is such a beloved movie" but after that it started to lag in a number of areas and the songs were just too numerous. It seemed to go on way too long.<br /><br /> Yet, it's a good film worthy of anyone's collection and the DVD transfer is very good: nice rich colors and reasonably sharp for a now 45- year-old film. There are some nice extras in here, too.  Andrews is wholesomely pretty and Glynis Johns, even with her strange voice, also is appealing. The kids are kind of stupid-looking, as are their parents.<br /><br />The other major character, the chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, is a likable chap, but hard to understand with this cockney impression. However, on the DVD, one can use the English subtitles when he speaks. Van Dyke surprised me with his singing and dancing talent. I didn't know he was that proficient.<br /><br />The movie was one of the first efforts at mixing real life with animation and they did it well. It still holds up today.
I ordered Disney's Mary Poppins from Amazon.com.  I received it when I expected it and it was worth the wait.  An added bonus is that it is an authenic copy and not bootlegged as received from a different vendor when I ordered Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The movie itself is very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone.
received in excellent condition & fast !!! LOVE U GUYS  The movie is even better than I remember !
I received mary poppins in short order, esp. at Christmas time! It arrived in the exact shape and condition that I expected.
A simply magical musical. Disney's finest. I enjoy this film more now than when I was a kid.  Exceptional digital and audio transfer.
Hello all! A great classic starring Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, English nanny and helpful chimney sweeper extrodinaire-by the way, despite what the dictionary says, supercalifragilistic-expealidotious, means to expidite, to go fast. Anyway this is a timeless classic, and it was aired on Disney's ABC-Sunday night for the first time in probably twenty years, shown on television that is! A spoonful of sugar is probably about cough syrup, but back then I believe it was either castor oil or cod liver oil!YUCHHHH! This movie must be seen to be beleived and if you have the time, watch as Mary Poppins floats down on the town in a dirty black smock and a black umbrella, and gets herself a job as a clean the kids room type nanny! A wonderful and expediantly timed film!-Thank you dear childre-Love Mary Poppins(Garry Hixon)-POOF!_bye
This movie will always be a classic. It's an excellent movie that showcases family and magic. I remember always wishing Mary Poppins was my nanny when I had to have a babysitter, because I thought they were all mean. This movie is a must see for everyone.
i saw this film when i was a kid now i have gotten the dvd version for my kids
Thanks for sending it punctually and in such perfect condition! We enjoyed this movie a lot!
Movie arrived in great condition, just one little skip toward the end. But for the price, I think it's a good buy
Having ordered items from Amazon in the past, I knew that I would first be getting a quality product sent in a timely manner. I was very well pleased with the whole process - from finding the item and finding the right one that I felt was the one that I knew my wife wanted. Then being able to order the item, using some of the gift certificates I had in my account.<br /><br />My concern was the timing of the delivery but it came without any delays and I was able to track it's process so I knew where it was at everyday.<br /><br />I will continue to shop and use Amazon because they know the meaning of customer service!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Don

This was the first Disney movie released after I was born.  The music did it for me &amp; the musical numbers.  Not the best, other wise the movie was too long.
Julie Andrews was incredible in this.  This musical came out brilliantly on film.  The music is wonderful and the imagination is great for both children and adults.<br /><br />Other classics not to forget about are:<br /><br />Mary Poppins<br /><br />My Fair Lady<br /><br />The Wizard of Oz<br /><br />Chitty Chitty Bang Band<br /><br />The first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory<br /><br />The Sound of Music<br /><br />Oliver<br /><br />West Side Story<br /><br />Fiddler on the Roof<br /><br />Singing in the Rain<br /><br />The Wiz<br /><br />Little Mermaid<br /><br />Aladdin<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast<br /><br />Grease<br /><br />The King and I<br /><br />Oklahoma<br /><br />The Music Man<br /><br />South Pacific<br /><br />My Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all!

It's outstanding! I bought it for my dog and she enjoyed it enormously. The service and price were excellent. I bought this movie for my dog. My cat said it was childish and didn't like it. But my 4 year old dog loves it. She's watched it many times.
Like many people, I saw the movie as a youngster and had the sound track record.  When the DVD first came out, I was upset to find that some of it was missing!  For example, a scene where the kids are actually making the kite with paper and glue with a too-large brush and the dog makes a mess of things; at the very end Burt saying "I love you, Mary Poppins" as she floats off.  With DVDs we expect a longer "directors cut" of a movie, not an abridged shortened version!<br /><br />Looking at the other editions for sale here, I see the running length is the same.  So, what I'd like to know is: is the full reature restored in this 40th anniversary edition?  I'd by it if it was.
Mr. Tyrell: It's TUPPENCE a bag.  Tuppence is 2 pence, or 2 pennies.  To buy a bag to feed the birds.<br /><br />And yes, I know the song--- all of them, by heart.<br /><br />This movie is a classic.  Wonderful fun even for the littlest ones.<br /><br />Sing along (but get the words right!)
I did it.  I bought a Disney movie -- I mean a kids-oriented one.  And then... I actually showed it to my kids (first I watched it again, just to make sure).<br /><br />This is so totally out of character for me, that it *does* deserve a gasp of surprise.<br /><br />Because Disney.  DISNEY!  No positive male role-models DISNEY!  Every male character is a fool, a tool, a slob, or a villain DISNEY!  Forget about little boys, because only girls are celebrated DISNEY!  And yes, I still think that is the case for Disney.  And I wonder who all those little girls will grow up to marry, when all the boys are fools, tools, slobs, or villains.<br /><br />But Julie Andrews.  JULIE ANDREWS!  Mary Poppins!<br /><br />So I cracked.  And I bought it.<br /><br />And I had a few twinges on my view-through -- the put-down of men as "rather stupid" in Mrs. Bank's first number; and the presumption that Mr. Banks' flying a kite with his children was somehow MORE valuable than his daily providing for them (I do appreciate the value of kite-flying, just not the value judgment); and the idea that the kids will respect a nanny who is sweet and pretty, but not one who smells weird.<br /><br />But I went ahead and showed it to the kids, and I'm so glad, because we have been singing the songs like crazy and laughing a lot.  The absolute fantasy of it is marvelous, and the songs are beautiful.  I like how Bert treats Mary.  I like how straight Mary is, as though she isn't magical, when she clearly is.<br /><br />Very nice.<br /><br />Now I'm wondering about Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Would anyone be so kind as to enlighten me about whether that one is as good?  Thanks!
Actually, in reference to the lyrics shown below, it should be "Tuppence a bag".  That's the price for a bag of bird food.<br /><br />As for the film, I still believe there was never one more magical and entertaining.  I don't really buy DVD's, but this one's an exception...can't wait 'til it's released.
I guess you get what you pay for.  Only $2 plus another $2-3 for shipping.  It's a DVD for the UK or Ireland.  It's printed in tiny letters on the DVD.  I obviously thought I was buying a DVD for the U.S.<br />Bummer
I got this movie,I also love their clothes in the movie. too bad,Julie Andrew can't sing. the kid who was Michael passed away of something,I don't know what of. I also like the song,too.
P.L. Travers rightfully objected to the way Disney's team ruined Mary Poppins' character.  It was bad enough to turn it into a musical--the "real" Mary Poppins never sang--but adding cartoons??  Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest.  I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old.  I agree with another reviewer--this is one of Disney's worst movies ever.  [...]
It's hard to deny the charm of "Mary Poppins," the enchantingly colorful movie, from an era where Disney had outstanding movies up the wazoo, rather than one every now and then. Now for the fortieth anniversary of this enchanting movie, it's been rereleased with a slew of bonus features -- and for lovers of this movie, it's worth every second.<br /><br />Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) have a tendency to drive their nannies crazy. So when their strict father (David Tomlinson) puts out a call for a new nanny, he's startled when only one woman comes -- and Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) answered the request letter his children gave him, which he threw away. Mary Poppins's magical talents and offbeat pals soon endear her to the kids, especially when they romp through a chalk painting and have tea parties on the ceiling.<br /><br />But things take a darker turn when Mr. Banks takes the children to the bank where he works (get it? Banks? Bank? Yeah, whatever). After the kids inadvertantly cause a riot, they are taken along by Mary Poppins' friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a goodhearted Cockney. And then things take an unexpected turn when Mr. Banks is in danger of losing his job, forcing him to realize what is really important in his life.<br /><br />Walt Disney (the man as well as the corporation) was at his peak when "Mary Poppins" debuted, starring rubbery comic Dick Van Dyke and Broadway star Julie Andrews. Even though the film was made forty years ago, the special effects and blend of animation and reality are remarkably fresh and undated -- from the cartoon foxhunt to the rival nannies being blown down the street by a strong wind. And the story is a timeless one -- family should come first.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the movie's more sober, melancholy second half makes it more palatable to adults. A spoonful of sugar may make the medicine go down, but you don't want too much sugar (ex. the cartoon chalk drawing, the goofy Uncle Albert who acts like he's on ecstacy) The fluff is toned down with the threat of unemployment and parental estrangement.<br /><br />What makes the bonus DVD worth getting? It seems to be mostly aimed at the target group (kids) rather than nostalgic adults -- there is a rather peculiar animated short, based on one of the Mary Poppins novels by the original author. There's also the "I Love to Laugh" game, which is basically answering questions to get Uncle Albert off the ceiling, a singalong, and a reconstructed concept-art song that was deleted from the final product, "Chimpanzoo."<br /><br />Fun for kids, but adults will skip right over to the audio commentary (Andrews and van Dyke) and historical reminiscing, which include a making-of featurette and a look at the musical creations in this film. A particular bonus is a reunion with Andrews, van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman around a piano -- it's just very relaxed, laid-back and well-made.<br /><br />One of the best things is that the entire film has been remastered. Half of "Mary Poppins'" charm is in the visuals and songs. So it's great to see the color and sound cleaned up and sharpened -- it has the slight fuzz of a film that needed a bit more work (or maybe that's my old TV), but overall the work is good.<br /><br />Forty years have passed, and "Mary Poppins'" charm is undiminished. So in celebration of that, the anniversary edition with all the bonus material is definitely worth getting.
Everyone knows this film, right?  It's essential watching for children of all ages.  Mary Poppins is the quinessential magical nanny, and Julie Andrews has become so identified with her performance in this film that  most people will always see her as Mary Poppins.<p>Anyways, I recently  purchased the Gold Collection DVD of this classic movie.  It is essentially  the same as the previous Disney release except for a few points.  First,  this one actually *has* a few extras, which most of the early Disney DVDs  lacked (shame on Disney!).  The transfer is the same, but in addition, we  now have a documentary on the film, a trailer, a short premiere featurette,  and a trivia game. It's still pretty sparse as far as extras go and nothing  spectacular, but it's an improvement for Disney.  Oh yes, and there are  those annoying trailers at the beginning of the DVD that Disney likes to  put on all its DVDs.  Oh well.<p>If you have the DVD already, don't bother  buying this one.  If you don't have the DVD, by all means purchase the Gold  collection Mary Poppins.  It's a classic film that can be enjoyed by the  family over and over again.
First Of All, Disney Did Mary Poppins A Dishoner in my opinion. They put out a Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix That Does Nothing To Enhance The Sound but add a bunch of reverb in the rear speakers and actually muddles the sound in my opinoin. Then they went and sweetened the sound effects by adding sounds that weren't in the original movie audio track. This is a no no! You don't Tamper with the original sound. All the sounds you hear must be faithful to the original film nothing added and nothing taken away. The original 2 channel audio track is the best sounding audio track on this release. Now if you still want my opinion, an earlier release of the film called the Mary Poppins Gold Classic Collection that was released in the 90's had the best audio track on it. Why disney didn't include this track I don't know but all the sounds were seperated and placed in individual speakers and no sweetening or reverb was added to the sound. Only this Gold Classic 90's Version of The release did not have 16x9 enhanced widescreen. Oh the film was presented in it's original widescreen but not enhanced to fit a widescreen TV. So as a consumer you are better off with the 40th anniversary edition. And one note, go into the audio settings and change the audio to the original 2 channel stereo and you'll get much better sound over the other choices unfortionatly. Not 5.1 surround but its better than the other 2 disney enhanced home theater mixes. Plus one more thing Disney did a dishoner with was removing the original Buena Vista Fanfare at the beginning of the movie in the 40th and 45th Anniversary Editions. Shame On you Disney. This release is not practically perfect in every way!
I am biased on this film.. I loved it since i was a kid!  I learned to read following along with my mom reading the "souvenier book" from the movie.  The transfer is superior, the special features are fun and interesting.  Watching it, I was 4 years old again (if only!)
This is such a wonderful movie.  This was the very first movie I saw in a theater as kid at age 9 and was allow to escort my younger cousin.  It was our first time alone in the theater and we felt so grown up.<br /><br />This movie was so full of surprises and has always been my second most favorite movie (after the Wizard of Oz.)  Julie Andrews was the most perfect nanny ever.  I've always wonder why our babysitters never carried a magic bag.  I remember going home and trying to snap my fingers to clean up my room.  My shock that my toys and clothes didn't move on their own.  The music was wonderful and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious was the biggest song hit in school (sung is just about every school's concert in our town.)<br /><br />This movie was full of magic.  It allow us to dream that things were possible.  Even when the grownups didn't understand, you knew that there was magic all around.  I am so thrill for the 40th anniversary and will get this.  I am still bum that you can't clean your house with a simple snap of your fingers.
The film speaks for itself. As fresh and damn well entertaining as it was forty years ago, this is How To Make a Family Movie 101. The cast are uniformly excellent (ignoring Dick Van Dyke's appaulling Cockney accent) and the songs are by far the Sherman Brothers' best. The extended running time never drags and the script sparkles with it's aim at every demographic.<br /><br />The extras are still a little sketchy - the 'plus much more' not boding very well - but the real gem of this is the commentary. Very few classic movies of this vintage are lucky enough to have their two principle performers still alive and I really had hoped that Andrews and Van Dyke would take to the microphone. I am not disappointed! Hopefully this will be an all-new group commentary and not just interveiw snippets spliced together.<br /><br />The other hope for this disc - and this one seems less likely - is that this will be released around the same time as the stage production of the movie hits the London stage. I would love to see some coverage of this show on the extras ala Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, but since the show will be in it's infancy, I doubt whether there would be time to assemble such footage. We may have to wait for the fiftieth anniversary edition for that!
No doubt this is a fantastic movie. Ask anyone. But there's one thing about this production that makes me want to break the disc over my knee: Disney has encoded this disc so that every time you watch it, YOU ARE FORCED TO SIT THROUGH THE ...PREVIEWS!<p>The DVD standard allows the producer to prevent viewers from activating certain functions at certain times (to make a DVD-based game, for example, play according to the game rules). But, aside from the FBI warning segment, this is the first movie I've encountered that WON"T EVEN LET YOU STOP THE DISC during the previews. You can't press MENU to get to other features, and you can't press STOP. You're stuck, basically, with the temptation to press EJECT. Fortunately, the production engineers at Disney missed one trick; you can at least Fast Forward through the previews. This is a shade better than turning off the TV and waiting it out.<p>C'mon, Disney. This isn't a rental -- I bought your disc! And you make me sit through 5 minutes of previews for things that I either: own, or choose not to own (thank you very much). I understand Disney's desire to "cross sell" their new stuff based on their old stuff. And I don't mind watching previews, but -- every time I play the disc? Shame on you!!<p>After you've wasted five minutes, of your life, enjoy the movie. It's a treasure and I wish someone would make another like it. But not on a disc like this!
Well, what can I say.  Mary Poppins was my alltime favorite movie as a child.  Although I never actually owned it, I had watched it in Day Care and seen it in the theatres.  I may just have to buy it now that it's on DVD.  It has some of my favorite songs.  Sometimes I catch myself singing "A Spoonful of Sugar," while doing my sidework at the restaurant where I work.  It is a great work song.
I think I like this movie more now than when I was a kid! And the extra features on this 2-DVD set are absolutely wonderful. Great interviews with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, one of the Sherman brothers (songwriter), and the girl who played Jane that really show how special the movie-making process was, which then translated to joy on the screen.<br /><br />The movie is long for little kids, but my 2-year-old requests "Step in Time" and "Jolly Holiday" frequently (let's hear it for scene selection!) and dances around the living room with the chimney sweeps!
Mary Poppins must be one of the loveliest filming produced by Disney studios. This musical movie is extremely well produced and has outstanding actor work. The scenes are of high quality despite the whole story was filmed indoors. Even the little part of London was reproduced in Disney studio. The music from Sherman brothers is world famous and well known. When you hear the first tunes, you might say: Hey I've heard that somewhere! Having this DVD on your shelf would please both you and your younger fellows.
Is there anyone left on the planet who does not know MARY POPPINS?  Made in 1963-1964, after a thirty year battle to convince a very stubborn and possessive P. L.  Travers  to give Walt Disney the rights to her book(s), it may be the Disney Studios' crowning film achievement.  It is a wonderful movie, a flawless blend of live action and animation, with some of the most beautiful and detailed matte paintings in movie history.  Julie Andrews, who won a Best Actress Oscar in her film debut, is the perfect nanny in 1910 Edwardian England to Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber).  And the movie won four other technical and music Oscars, with a still untopped thirteen total nominations.<br /><br />With chimney sweep/street artist/best buddy Bert (Dick Van Dyke in peak form), Mary Poppins leads Jane and Michael on many magical adventures.  These include a live-action/animation day in the park ("Supercalifragilisticexpealidocis"), a tea party on a ceiling with Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, the hauntingly beautiful "Feed the Birds" with bird woman Jane Darwell, and the Oscar-winning "Chim-Chim-Curree" on the rooftops of London.  (Peter Ellenshaw allegedly did 100 breathtakingly beautiful and detailed matte paintings for this movie, winning a well-deserved visual effects Oscar.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Banks family is controlled like clockwork by Mr. Banks (a perfectly cold and stuffy David Tomlinson, who turns 180 degrees over the movie's fast-paced 140 minutes.  (Cotton Warburton won an Editing Oscar.)  Glynis Johns is an ideal and likeable suffragette and feminist Mrs. Banks.  Mr. Banks works in the bank and constantly wants his kids to open a bank account, but they are always off playing with Mary Poppins or  Bert.<br /><br />MARY POPPINS is a fabulous feast of a movie, with some of the greatest visual effects and most beautiful matte paintings I have ever seen.  The cast is perfection, the writing something that even grouchy Pamela Travers should be pleased with.  And the 40th anniversary restoration on DVD has shimmeringly rich color, crystal-clear image clarity, and awesome 5.1 Home Theatre Mix THX sound to top any theater sound system.<br /><br />Disk 2 runs over three hours and includes composer Richard Sherman giving us deleted songs that ended up in other Disney animated movies, were cut for sheer length on a movie that runs almost two-and-a-half hours without them, and chats with Julie Andrews and Dick Andrews.  A full hour behind-the-scenes documentary shows how most of the magnificent visual effects were achieved, should you want the illusion spoiled.  We see the battle to get P.L. Travers to let Walt Disney film her precious baby of a novel over three full decades and working over the screenplay to make it all seamless plot-wise.  Finally, we have long lost footage of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre Los Angeles world premiere in August 1964 and various movie trailers for those who want to know how this very magical masterpiece was marketed.<br /><br />The two-disk 40th anniversary DVD of MARY POPPINS belongs in every house with kids--and kids at  heart.  With it, a hundred filmmaking aspects come together perfectly to create a masterpiece that gets my vote as Walt Disney's crowning film achievement.
We've all seen it, but when is the last time you went back and `re-watched' it as an adult.  This movie is, in my opinion, quite possibly the greatest movie ever made.  Truly magical, timeless, endlessly entertaining.  It's got songs, dancing, laughing, crying, animation, live action, special effects, great acting (minus Dick Van Dyke's attempted `cockney accent'), and a great story.  What more can be said?  Walt Disney's finest cinematic achievement, at least while he was living, and his most deliberate work of `magic.'
The Banks family is in need of a new nanny for Jane and Michael. Fortunately, one arrives on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins. She's everything the kids want, fun and magical. But while she's taking them to chalk painting countrysides and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less then happy. Can he be made to see beyond the end of his nose?<br /><br />Ok, so this movie is really little more then an excuse for song and dance numbers. It's still great! The plot is paper thin, and you loose site of it in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes. Of course, part of that is because the movie is based on a book that is really nothing but short stories. Still this movie is more about fun then anything else. And it has that in spades. What kid wouldn't have fun imaging that they get to do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie?<br /><br />It's said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned into making this film, and it shows. Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today. There were some I still hadn't figured out until watching this special edition. And the music! Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart. And you can't help but find yourself humming "A Spoonful of Sugar," "Jolly Holiday," "Let's Go Fly a Kite," or "Chim Chim Cher-ee" for days after seeing it.<br /><br />Those wanting to own a great DVD of this film won't be disappointed in this two-disc set. Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory. I can't see how it's ever looked better. The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will blow you away. It's fantastic. There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane), and Richard Sherman. Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself. Also included are some pop up facts to read along with while watching the movie. Disc two features a new documentary on the film, a deleted song, and more on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers. And be sure to check out the animated "The Cat That Looked at a King," a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series.<br /><br />One thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney. The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius. With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come.
Out of all the new movies and violence out there today I was shocked beyond belief when all 3 of my kids (10, 7 and 4) sat through this, not once but 4, and watched the entire movie!!! I guess there is good reason it's a classic Disney film.
"Mary Poppins" is one of those classic musicals that you probably loved as a kid, then think you outgrew- until you show it to your own kids (or yourself) and happily sing along. That's what I found on viewing this Disney masterpiece for the first time in decades. The fabulous Julie Andrews- already a Broadway/ West End star, and here an Oscar winner right out of the gate- became a beloved institution as the world's most famous nanny. Dick Van Dyke was already a huge TV star before he shined here as Bert the chimney sweep/sidewalk artist/one-man band, weird Noo Yawk-cockney accent and all. A host of Brits both veteran (foppish David Tomlinson and vibrant Glynis Johns) and young (the button-cute Karen Dotrice and the late Matthew Garber) fill out the excellent cast, probably the best in any live-action Disney movie before or since. Look for Van Dyke in his Rip Van Winkle getup, too, as what his old boss Carl Reiner might have called "the 2000-year-old bank president".<br /><br />  The Sherman brothers would score many more Disney and related family movies, but never came close to the joy of this one. With its distinctive Olde English lilt (music-hall, military marches, Gilbert and Sullivan), the music did a huge part to make "Mary Poppins" the treasure it is: "Spoonful of Sugar", "Jolly Holiday", "Chim-Chim-Cheree" (an Oscar winner on its own), the still-haunting "Feed The Birds" and, of course, that busker-flavored number with the 34-letter title...oh, dear, what is it? "Super-Calabogus...Super-California...got it! Docious-Ali-Expi..." Never mind. If you don't know this song, don't bother reading any further and go back to your "adult" fare.<br /><br />  I'd forgotten about the animated sequences and art work that combined with the superb settings and wardrobe (designed by Julie's then-husband) to give "Mary Poppins" its authentic atmosphere and feel for Edwardian London. Disney had a couple of house Brits- director Robert Stevenson ("Swiss Family Robinson",<br /><br />"Treasure Island") and artist Peter Ellenshaw (his gorgeous title painting of Olde London Towne)- who really did transport you back in time along with the cast and songs. The animation isn't exactly Pixar-style, but the soft-color, old-school Disney<br /><br />look is just right for the carnival/teatime/race course "Jolly Holiday" sequence, penguins and all.<br /><br />  The bonus material, as you'd expect for a true classic, is superb. We learn from the documentary feature (almost an hour in itself) that Disney pursued the movie rights as early as 1938. You might say it was worth his wait! Just about all of the surviving principals are part of the extras and commentary, which include two delightful musical segments with songwriter Dick Sherman. One of these brings back Julie and Dick to reminisce and sing their songs- most warmly indeed. On his own, Sherman reveals the inspiration for the tunes ("Step In Time" was adapted from the music-hall dance tune "Knees Up Mother Brown"). There are moving moments, too: Sherman on how "Feed The Birds" moved Walt like no other song; a still-girlish Karen Dotrice, long-retired from acting, breaks down when she tells of co-star Matthew Garber's death at 21 and Walt's own passing two years after "Poppins"' release. Not many movies can stir such emotions, happy and sad, 40 years on- this one does. Finally, as with many Disney (and Pixar) DVDs, there's an animated bonus: "The Cat who Looked at the King", adapted from a later P.L. Travers story, a cute little cartoon fable featuring great voice work by Tracey Ullman (as a white kitten with a moral) and David Ogden Stiers (as know-it-all Old King Cole).<br /><br />  Whether you have children or not, it should be a must to watch "Mary Poppins" at least once a year, as not only a great piece of true family entertainment but a reminder of how both Disney and Hollywood really did care about quality movies for ages 3 to 93. A wonderful package for a wonderful musical- the kind you know they don't make any more. Highly recommended!
One of the best children's movies of all time, "Mary Poppins" is one of Walt Disney's finest accomplishments. When he paired an up-and-coming young actress (Julie Andrews) with an established, bankable, and enthusiastic star (Dick Van Dyke), Disney struck cinematic gold.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" compares favorably with even the best childrens' fare of the last 40 years, and is just as enjoyable for older family members. Never preachy or saccharine, the movie can be enjoyed again and again.<br /><br />Everyone who loves movies should own this 2-DVD set, packed with extras. There are absolutely no flaws to be seen, and the extras are top-notch. If you are on the fence about purchasing this movie, go ahead and order it from Amazon right away, with full confidence.<br /><br />Five stars!
Come along now, children, let's read this review. No straggling now. There you go.<br /><br />I must have only seen "Mary Poppins" when I was a little kid because I only barely remembered the movie when I was watching it and definitely didn't remember the plot. Definitely an experience worth having, whether you've seen it once, or many, many times.<br /><br />The basic plot is that two kids have been a real terror to their nannies, but not so much out of meanness as the nannies' domineering personalities. They draw up a list of their needs for a nanny and when the wind changes, Mary Poppins comes, despite their tight-laced fathers' wishes. They're soon off on fantastical adventures that may just change the lifestyle of their entire family! This movie makes important comments about suffrage, structure, and just finding the joy in life. It's supercalifragilisticexpealidocious! (And I didn't even have to look that up!)<br /><br />The movie is presented in wide-screen with fully-restored, bright and colorful animation and practically perfect sound. There's also both a subtitle and a close-caption track, although oddly these differ greatly in what they do and don't pick up on. I ended up keeping on both.<br /><br />Like other recent Disney Platinum releases, this DVD contains a wealth of special features that will help you to enjoy the movie more. Chief among them is a great deleted song. You also get a complete making-of feature, a look at the movie magic, a game, promo posters and trailers and many other simply delightful goodies.<br /><br />Like the "Aladdin" release, this release is loaded with both a commentary track and pop-up fun-facts. If you actually decide to watch all of this stuff, you'll end up having seen the film at least three times by the time you're done!<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? Go off now and buy this! Spit-spot!
When I was a little kid, I couldn't get this film at all, but when I heard many positive reviews of this film, some saying that it was the best Disney film ever, I decided to give it another shot. So, I bought the DVD, and now, it's starting to grow on me! I now fully agree that this is the best Disney film I've seen! It's no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards! Songs like "Chim Chim Cher-ee" "Spoonful of Sugar" "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" will always get stuck inside your head!<br /><br />This will always be Julie Andrews best character, no matter how many films she makes. She does a perfect job with Mary Poppins, and yet, she can really sing! No wonder she was that good in Broadway! I believe Walt Disney made a perfect choice to hire Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins!<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke ROCKS! He's really funnier than ever, playing as Bert, and yet, he's also a great dancer! I really laughed when he laughs in different stages during the scene with Uncle Albert. Another perfect selection made by Walt Disney!<br /><br />The Special Effects were PERFECT! I've learned that Cherry Tree Lane was actually in the indoor stage, but I thought at first that it took place in London! It's no doubt the best set I've ever seen. Also, I was really surprised when they wanted this to look like a Broadway stage! I really thought they succeeded in doing that when they were doing the song, "Step in Time," which had really perfect energy, and there were no accidents, which really amazed me! I was also impressed that when the Nannies were blew away by a strong wind, and Mary Poppins flying to and from the Banks' house, or all of the Uncle Albert footage, or all the scenes in which they fly, you CAN'T see a SINGLE wire! The fireworks sounds were perfect on the 5.1 mixed edition! I can go on and on, but I'm all out of ideas!<br /><br />Behind the Scenes and Trailers were a perfect help for the Disc 2 edition. It also has a new short called, "The Cat that Looked at the King." While having an okay title, this short was very good. It would be a shame that it would not win an Oscar.<br /><br />I give this movie a solid +10/10<br /><br />I give this DVD a solid +10/10 for having a perfect video and audio presentations! The video was so enchanting, that I couldn't see a single scratch! The audio was amazing, but I'd stick with the 5.1 mix!<br /><br />Get this DVD for not only the kids, but for the adults too!<br /><br />I'm sure that everyone around the world will find this movie and this DVD, "SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS!!!"
Fantastic 2-disc set with all sorts of fun goodies! Especially great are clips from the opening premiere and "deconstructing" musical numbers like "Jolly Holiday" in which you see how the magic was made in the chalk drawing segment. A must-have for your movie collection!
Long resistant to film adaptations of her Mary Poppins books, P. L. Travers finally succumbed to the entreaties of Walt Disney, and the result is often considered the finest of Disney's personally supervised films. The Travers stories are bundled together to tell the story of the Edwardian-era British Banks family: the banker father (David Tomlinson), suffragette mother (Glynis Johns), and the two "impossible" children (Karen Dotrice and Mathew Garber). The kids get the attention of their all-business father by bedevilling every new nanny in the Banks household. Whem Mr. Banks advertises conventionally for another nanny, the kids compose their own ad, asking for someone with a little kindness and imagination. Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her screen debut) answers the children's ad by arriving at the Banks home from the skies, parachuting downward with her umbrella. She immediately endears herself to the children. The next day they meet Mary's old chum Bert (Dick Van Dyke), currently employed as a sidewalk artist. Mary, Bert and the children hop into one of Bert's chalk drawings and learn the nonsense song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" in a cartoon countryside. Later, they pay a visit to Bert's Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so hard that he floats to the ceiling. Mr. Banks is pleased that his children are behaving better, but he's not happy with their fantastic stories. To show the children what the real world is like, he takes them to his bank. A series of disasters follow which result in his being fired from his job. Mary Poppins' role in all this leads to some moments when it is possible to fear that all her good work will be undone, but like the magical being she is, all her "mistakes" lead to a happy result by the end of the film.<br /><br />As to the soundtrack, its FANTASTIC!  The 5.1 surround soundmix really  puts you right  into  the scenes of whats going on!!  The subwoofer really  kicks in  many  times!!  And you feel as if you are  right  there with  the fireworks going off every which  way when the tune 'Step  In Time" comes to its end!<br /><br />God bless all those who  worked on  making this  2 disc set so very  special!<br /><br />The extras on  this 2 disc set are fantastic!!  There is so much  new footage shown  from  the time this movie was made,  you will see outtakes and some fun being had on  the set!<br /><br />This is  such  a great  special  edition  that  anyone who  loves this movie will LOVE having this to own!<br /><br />Just  wait til you watch  these extras, you will NOT be bored at  all! :)
With this new 2-disc release, Disney Studios finally "got it right."  Kudos to the technical specialists who cleaned up the animation sequences and the soundtrack irregularities that have plagued every release of "Mary Poppins" ... until now! The 5.1 Surround Mix is superb and the sound engineers have equalized the voices during the songs that contained dialogue that was dubbed into the sequence, so now it is hardly noticeable. The Disney Home Theater Stereo Mix is even better than the original stereophonic theatrical release. It was just thrilling to watch the opening credits and see the actual care and love gone into cleaning up the original artwork.  Here is a Textbook Example of how to digitally restore a movie without destroying it (are you listening, George Lucas?).<br /><br />A technical note: This edition is listed as being widescreen (1.66:1) whereas my 1998 edition of "Mary Poppins" listed a screen ratio of 1.88:1.  Whichever it is, it is the same screen ratio as the 1998 edition (thankfully).<br /><br />"Mary Poppins," in my opinion, has always been the best film Walt Disney ever produced, and the care he took in producing it is evident in the casting (especially the cameo roles). Robert Stevenson's direction is classic and unobtrusive; the editing is well-paced; the cinematography perfect.  It is no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards, mostly for technical achievements and the music, and of course one big one for Best Actress to Julie Andrews in her film debut!
The extras on this version are wonderful. The best bonus on it is the backstage look at the making of the movie. Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, among others, share stories about Walt and their experiences while making the movie. There are some especially touching stories about Walt Disney, and the elderly lady appearing in the song "feed the birds," which happened to be one of Walt's favorite songs.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed on the dvd, is footage from the 1964 gala premiere with some color footage even. There are numerous little facts and stories all throughout the bonus features that are sure to interest fans. Watching this dvd has made me like the movie even more, from realizing all the work that went into making this film. From the live action and animation combinations, to the choreography- Mary Poppins is one fine Disney classic and this is a very well put together dvd.
...she's calling to you.<p>In my mind, this movie is the reason why Disney is great.  The rest of them - however good many of them may be - don't hold a candle (on the water) to this wonderful Disney masterpiece.  This is easily my favorite Disney movie ever and one of my favorite movies of all time.<p>One of the things I love most about this movie is the fact that there's plenty of entertainment here for children; but there's also a lot of humor for adults.  So, when the children grow up, they can have just as much, if not more, appreciation for the film.  I love the way the satire starts out.  Mrs. Banks comes home from her Sister Suffragettes Rally, shouting and singing for women's rights and equality with men<p>("Though we adore men individually,<br />We agree that as a group<br />They're rather stupid.").<p>Then Mr. Banks comes home from work singing about the pleasures of being a man in this age in England:<p>"It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910.<br />King Edward's on the throne;<br />It's the age of men!<br />I'm the lord of my castle!<br />The sovereign!<br />The liege!"<p>I still love the thought of a house which sports a naval cannon deck on top.  And I have to confess when I was a child I did try the finger snap to see if it would get my room clean.  (It didn't work, so I just grew up in a messy room.)<p>The fantastic acting performances by Julie Andrews (who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - back in the days when the person who won was usually the person who deserved to win), the children, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, Glynnis Johns, Jane Darwell (though her part was very small), and the rest - cannot be overstated.  I have already said that this is Disney's best film.  Well, it is also boasts the finest acting ever in a Disney film.<p>I highly recommend purchasing this in the Widescreen format.  You will see a lot more of the picture than in the standard format.  Unfortunately, the widescreen version is out of print (you can still buy them used; that's how I got mine); and it looks like the standard version may also be going out of print soon.  Hopefully, that means there will be a special deluxe edition with both formats, documentaries, commentaries, etc. coming out soon.
This is great because it's in widescreen. The images are clear, the colours are bright, and this has the look of a restored version (or at least a good print). The R &amp; R Sherman songs never date and you will find modern children all over England and America singing along to Chim Chim Cheree and A Spoonful Of Sugar just as their parents did. David Tomlinson is both stuffy and loveable as Mr Banks, and Glynis Johns is wonderfully scatty as his wife. The two children are probably the least irritating in cinema history and were something of a casting coup for Disney, when compared with the horrid child actors in most of their output. But it is Dick Van Dyke who makes the film the fun it is. You can imagine, say a Petula Clark or a Diana Rigg as Mary Poppins, but only Van Dyke could play Bert the way he does. Leave aside the dodgy accent, and you're left with a great song and dance man who could carry the film even without the co-stars. The one disappointment is that there aren't any extras on this disc (I don't call scene selection a feature!).
My mom took me to see this when I was just a lad, <p>and it was one of the best times that I had ever had.  <p>Last month my wife and I, we watched it with our kids, <p>and they enjoyed it just as much as we ever did.  <p>Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidoscious, even though the sound of it....
At one point near the beginning of "Mary Poppins", the character of Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, looks upwards at the heavens and contemplates aloud, "Winds in the east, mist coming in, like somethin' is brewin' and bout to begin. Can't put me finger on what lies in store, but I fear what's to happen all happened before." Yes Bert...the winds carry the stench of "Revolution". Che Poppins, affixing urban camoflauge paint to her face in a cloud not far overhead, only needs the wind to change direction before she officially brings her own brand of childcare carnage to the big screen.<br /><br />We're soon introduced to the Banks family, living in the upscale suburbs in turn of the century London, England. Dad is a capitalist and entrepreneur, battling daily doses of smog, mutinous home workers, and a wife deeply involved in an underground anti-government organization, all the while bringing home the bacon and trying to keep his home ship-shape (his neighbor takes that phrase to a whole new level). But Papa Banks also has two impressionable offspring, both intent on driving their daycare workers to the brink of madness. They too have demands, which they list clearly on a manifesto brought forth and read aloud to the governing parties of the house regarding any future nannies: "You must be kind, you must be witty. Very sweet and fairly pretty. Take us on outings, give us treats. Sing songs, bring sweets". Clearly the equal distribution of sugared confections is a high priority here.<br /><br />Enter Mary Poppins, part witch creature, part guerilla warlord, she descends upon the Banks home in a well placed para-drop and singularly blows away (literally) all the competition with efficiency that any syndicate overlord would admire. Market saturation obviously is of no consequence to her and within moments of destroying the competition she has asserted herself to Mr. Banks and appointed herself as Nanny Overlord of the Banks residence. Soon afterwards Comrade Poppins sets up shop in the children's part of the house and instructs the children on ways to better serve the State. And it starts by cleaning up one's room.<br /><br />The children are introduced to "everyman" Bert, a man who changes jobs each day in an attempt to avoid the government from learning his whereabouts. Whether Bert is belting out songs of The Worker's Struggle, selling low-end kites to the proletariat, or scrawling subversive images into the sidewalks of London, it's clear that he has an agenda, that being to destroy the moral fabric of upstanding, law-abiding families. Bert's fight against City Hall comes to a head when the next door neighbor, Admiral Boom, representing the military-industrial complex, collides with the ideologies of Bert and his comrades. Specifically Adm. Boom launches a gunpowder-laden sneak attack on Bert and his friends at a Chimney Sweep Union meeting, setting in motion the final act of The Great Peasant Uprising. Mr. Banks, now bereft of his job thanks in large part to "Politburo" Poppins' anarchist child-rearing methods, now has no income and cannot even afford to feed the birds. Nor can he spare tuppence a bag. He spends the much of the rest of the film hiding in the basement, much as Lenin's foes did. And if Banks is one of the foes, then Poppins is Trotsky reborn, shuffling out of the movie with no warning and with only an eerie promise of returning soon, perhaps in time for the next revolution. And then the concerned viewer is told to go fly a kite. How cheeky!<br /><br />The extras DVD contains interviews with the principal actors and actresses, behind the scenes looks at the actors in action, the how-to's of 1960's special effects, the stories behind the songs, and much more. There is a commentary track by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke to watch with the movie, if that's your thing. Interesting to know that the robin which Mary Poppins sings to was actually run by thick cables which had to be carefully hidden from the camera by Julie Andrews and resulted in a whole lot of shot retakes. If musicals are your thing, then Mary Poppins will be your thing.
Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) don't want another strict, unfriendly nanny. Their father (David Tomlinson), a banker, believes that they need discipline and strict guidance. Their mother (Glynnis Johns), a leader of the Women's Suffragette movement, seems to agree with the children, but can't really say so. The next morning, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) arrives and takes the job, based on an advertisement the children wrote. Soon, she is leading the children in song, displaying her magical spells and clearly enchanting the children in each and every way. She introduces the children to Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a street performer who seems to have some history with Mary and they are off on a magical journey.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins", released in 1964, represented a magical blend of live action and animation that, at the time, was technologically very advanced. Disney just released a 40th Anniversary DVD, complete with a second disc of interesting extras.<br /><br />Watching the film again, I was struck by how rudimentary the special effects seemed. Then, remembering that this film was made in 1964, these same special effects became charming and wholly fitting for the story. The story is told through the eyes of the Banks children, and the use of these special effects helps to put us in their shoes. The story is set in Victorian England and it seems completely realistic that children in this era would see toy soldier marching into a toy box (stop motion), jump into a chalk drawing (2D animation) and watch their nanny sing to a bird (animatronics). The outdated look of these effects serves the point of view of the story beautifully and adds to the charm of it. We actually get a feeling that we are looking at a picture book as we watch the film. I can't even imagine how slick and uninviting the same film would be if it were made today, with CGI special effects coming out of the woodwork.<br /><br />Yes, the film is very saccharin at times, but this helps to define the viewpoint of the children as well. The story is told through their eyes. The struggles of their mother to win `the vote', their father's troubles at the bank, life in England at the turn of the 20th Century, are not going to be delved into too deeply. The children don't know about these problems. If the film started dealing with the mother's attempts to lead the suffragette movement, for instance, the viewpoint and the story would become off-balance.<br /><br />One of the most delightful things about "Mary Poppins" is the musical score containing many classic songs.  I've seen this film, or parts of it, dozens of times over the years. I think that even if you have seen it only once or twice, you probably remember many of the songs. "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", "Step In Time", "Spoonful of Sugar", "Jolly Holiday" and "Perfect Nanny" are all songs that I remember, and I can even sing a couple of lines for most. The true mark of a good Broadway musical is that you leave the theater humming the tunes. The same holds true for a musical film. All of the best musicals remain classics because we remember the songs. The Sherman Brothers created a great score of music and songs all of which served to enhance and supplement the story.<br /><br />Watching the DVD, the second disc contains a making of documentary, a musical reminiscence with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and the surviving Sherman brother, a new animated short with Julie Andrews taking her grandchildren into a new chalk painting where they meet "The Cat That Looked Like A King" and more. There is also a brief featurette showing how the live action photography of Van Dyke and Andrews walking along the path for the "Jolly Holiday" number and the live action photography of "Step in Time" was superimposed with animation. While watching the making of documentary, I learned an interesting fact. Disney wanted the film to look like a Broadway play. All of the sets were fabricated on sound stages, adding to the idealized look of the entire film. "Chimpanzoo", a deleted song is also included. Sung by Richard Sherman and illustrated by story boards for the deleted sequence, presumably, it would have been part of the "Jolly Holiday" number. It is probably better that it was left out of the film.<br /><br />There are a lot more features on the second disc, too many to list. As is the case with the best Disney DVDs, it appears that they have included everything they could get their hands on. This makes the DVD a must-have for film scholars and collectors. Essentially, the best Disney DVDs are encyclopedias on the making of the films. Filmmakers, enthusiasts and scholars have the opportunity to learn so much from these DVDs, even if a lot of the material is sugar-coated.<br /><br />This is Julie Andrews's first film. Before this, she appeared on Broadway and in a television version of "Cinderella". It is a truly remarkable, accomplished performance, amazing for someone acting in their first film. Andrews brings just the right blend of friendship, guidance and stern leadership to the role. Hand in hand as she enchants the children, she appears slightly annoyed at various points. And what is the relationship between her and Bert? These are questions left unanswered by the film, thankfully. If they were to remake this film, the filmmakers would probably feel it necessary to make her a former barmaid or tarted up boozer, make her back-story more explicit.<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke was a more established star at the time. His television show was in full swing and he had previously appeared in the Broadway and film versions of "Bye Bye Birdie". It might seem strange that a rising star would take what is essentially a supporting role, but I think he made a wise choice. He brings an unabashed enthusiasm to the role which is also very fitting. The entire film is meant to be seen through the eyes of Jane and Michael. Naturally, they would see a character like Bert as the neatest guy in the world. Van Dyke created a role that he will always be remembered for.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" is a classic. Every spoon full of sugar helps the film remain a classic in each and every way.
Anyone who has a 16x9, widescreen television will be disappointed to discover that the technical information provided by Disney.  They released this disc saying that it was in a widscreen ANAMORPHIC format.  It is not.  It is widscreen (letterbox) but it is not anamorphic so it is distorted when displayed on a widscreen television.  It's disappointing because this film is one of Walt Disney's crowning achievements and it's too bad that they didn't put it out in the best possible format.
So, my daughter has become obsessed with `Mary Poppins'.  She wants to be her.  She watches this movie daily, sings all the songs, draws pictures of her, runs through the house with her umbrella, asks me CONSTANTLY what `supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' means...etc.<br /><br />Seriously, she is OBSESSED.<br /><br />Normally, her obsessions ware on me, and I'm sure that in time this one will too, but one thing that has come of this is that I've actually got to sit through the film a few times recently.  Now, I saw `Mary Poppins' years ago, and I've always held it in high regard.  I love Julie Andrews; seriously.  She's one of my favorite actresses and I've always held a special place in my heart for both `Mary Poppins' and `The Sound of Music'; her two most recognizable films.  So, with years behind me, I settled in to watch this film for the first time in a long time and I must say that I was astounded at how well this delightful film holds up.  It's still just as charming and magical as the first day I saw it.<br /><br />But my oh my, this is a long movie!<br /><br />Julie Andrews, who snagged an Oscar for her performance in this film, is just all sorts of amazing as the magical nanny who comes along at the right time to spread some joy and bring a family closer together.  The rest of the cast is also delightful, even Dick Van Dyke despite a horribly shaky Cockney accent.<br /><br />From dazzling set pieces to beautifully composed songs to sharply meshed animated sequences, `Mary Poppins' has so much to offer!  This is a great Anniversary Edition (I know that there has been a 45th released, but this is the one I own and I see no real need to upgrade) with loads of special features to keep you and your little ones occupied.
I've loved this movie since childhood and was excited to purchase it for Christmas this year for my girls.  The digital quality seems very good, and all the old classic songs are there in crisp sound.  Now my girls are in love with "Miss Mary Poppins" as much as I am!  Couldn't be more pleased.
Every one has so eloquently reviewed this wonderful movie that I can add nothing but my personal little story of the way I felt when I first saw the movie.<br />I went with my mother and her friend and we sat in the balcony of an old movie theater down town. I was 9.  The theater is kind of spooky and I remember being a little unnerved by it.  The movie started and I was absolutely and utterly in love with Julie Andrews from the moment she appeared on the screen.  I remember even attemptling to speak with a british accent after I saw the film.  My mother said at the time how wonderful Dick Van Dyke was and I remember being so mad at  her for saying that--how dare she say anything against "my" Julie. But seeing it again as an adult I have to say she was absolutely right. (dont you hate it when you have to admit your mother was right? ) I have heard people vilify Dick Van Dyke for his accent but we have to remember that everyone else was british.  He is so wonderful in this film that it takes my breath away and at the end when he is chastising Mr. Banks and telling him in a nice way that he hasnt made enough time for his children, it always makes me cry.  He was wonderful, SHE was wonderful.  Wonderful movie.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JRB16U">Mary Poppins (45th Anniversary Special Edition)</a><br /><br />It was a joy to have my six year old grandson put down his Guns, Light Sabers, and Star Wars Battle gear for a while to actually sit down and watch Mary Poppins with his little sister and I. He laughed and sang right along with us. I also noticed how calm and happy he was afterward.
"Mary Poppins" appeared in movie theaters in 1964.  I remember the movie playing for week after week after week.  I think this was Disney's biggest hit, ever.  I suppose I have seen the movie three or four times since then.  I always enjoy some of the special effects.  The animation scenes were very good when they first appeared, but have aged a little since then.  And, Julie Andrews had a wonderful voice and sang great songs in the film.<br /><br /> In short, a magical nanny swoops in to take care of the Banks children and also helps their father to value them and make time for them. Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) treats the children to adventures with Bert (Dick van Dyke), a street performer/chimney sweep and with her Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) who loves to laugh. There are excellent songs and dance numbers.<br /><br />Children still fall in love with this movie.  Adults still like it.  And Julie Andrews' performance still shines.
When we recently went to see Walt Disney's landmark 1964 musical fantasy transformed into a Broadway musical, I approached it much the same as when I first saw "Superman the Movie" in 1978. The earlier version was such a part of so many lives it seemed inconceivable that anyone could make it work as a live musical.<br /><br />Superman managed to succeed beyond expectations, and so does "Mary Poppins" on Broadway. The movie and the show are related yet compliment each other. Not an easy task.<br /><br />How this was accomplished is chronicled in a new documentary on the new two-disc "Mary Poppins 45th Anniversary Edition DVD."<br /><br />The original stage stars, Ashley Brown (who knew she wasn't really English?) and Gavin Lee discuss the process from audition to production, along with the talented artists who brought Poppins alive on stage.<br /><br />Well worth the DVD set alone is the ENTIRE "Step in Time" show-stopper filmed right from the stage, complete with one of the most talked about marvels in the show: Bert's miraculous dance around and over the stage proscenium. Lee explains the evolution of the stunt in the accompanying documentary.<br /><br />We also were able to glimpse one of the sweeps in "Step in Time," the immensely talented Sean McCourt, who plays several roles in the stage Poppins as he did for years in Wicked. We were fortunate enough to learn of his contributions from a backstage Wicked presentation he hosted with equally gifted colleague Anthony Galde, who still plays multiple roles in that show.<br /><br />The most warmhearted and reassuring thing about the new 45th Anniversary bomus material is the generous attention afforded to the cooperative relationship between Richard M. Sherman and the new songwriters, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe (Robert Sherman's health prevents the activity).<br /><br />And while you may think it's a no-brainer that Mr. Sherman was included to some extent, consider that after the duo successfully wrote songs for The Tigger Movie, they were summarily replaced for the next Pooh film. In the case of Poppins, clearly every courtesy was accorded the score and the two legends who created it. It's especially wonderful to see all three songwriters on screen, two in England, one in California, singing together.<br /><br />For even more detail about the story of the "Poppins" flight from book to screen to stage, take a look at the massive and beautiful book co-written by expert historian Brian Sibley, "Mary Poppins: Anything Can Happen If You Let It."<br /><br />Magnificent stage artwork from the stage version rounds out the new bonus material on the recent DVD, for the info of those who have the earlier versions. Most everything contained in the 40th anniversary edition is still here except for a game and a piece-by-piece reconstruction of a "Jolly Holiday" excerpt.<br /><br />But it still includes the wonderful audio commentary with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Richard Sherman -- and who wouldn't want to "watch" the movie with them? My only quibble: a guide folder to the discs would have been nice.<br /><br />And if you still have the single-disc Gold Classic edition, you may want to keep that one because it's the only one with the complete "Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere," a short theatrical film with delightfully cheesy narration ("the vivacious Annette!") as well as the after party audio material. The newer two releases use this footage for a similar bonus, but it's nice to have the original.<br /><br />(By the way, the connection between "Superman" and "Mary Poppins" may have seemed a strange juxtaposition, but both of them not only can fly, but they spin around real fast, too!)<br /><br />Whether you feel the new release is worth your while or not, I am pleased to see "Mary Poppins" reissued as often as possible. This is a very important film, not a relic of the past, and reissuing brings it to the public's attention each time and hopefully introduces it to another legion of fans. Here's to keeping everything higgledy-piggeldy around here!
I saw Mary Poppins when it was first released in 1964 and even after all these years, the movie never fails to enchant and entertain, boasting the academy-award winning debut of Julie Andrews as the practically perfect, nay, perfect Mary and Dick Van Dyke as Bert the jack-of-all-trades is also superb, even though his cockney accent comes and goes at whim.  His last occupation as a chimney sweep leads to "Chim Chim Cheree" as a march across the rooftops of London by he and Mary with the children Jane and Michael as tag-alongs seques into a platoon of sweeps singing and dancing "Step in Time"led by Bert in one of the longest dance sequences in the history of cinema.<br /><br />P.L. Travers the author of the original stories was somewhat dismayed(to say the least) at the Disneyfication of her somewhat somber and dark tales---but the lighter touch is much preferred over the somewhat dreary production. now trodding the boards on Broadway and London.<br /><br />The movie is brimming with many brilliant set-peices including the extended "Jolly Holiday" sequence which seamlessly blends cartoon characters with Mary, Bert and the children featuring the nonsense song "Supercali....etc".<br /><br />Another standout sequence is "Feed the Birds" the prettiest song in the score.<br /><br />Glynnis Johns as the dizzy Mrs Banks, "Sister Suffragate" is adorable and David Tomlinson as the appropriately stuffy Mr Banks who has a somewhat pedantic view on how to run a household,wife and children until Bert, not Mary shows him the error of his ways.<br /><br />To be sure Mary Poppins has its flaws.  Sometimes it tends to be precious(the children)and sweet(the children) but not sweet enough to bring cavities but all in all, Mary Poppins is still fresh and bright after 45 years and 45 years from now when most of us reading this will be memories, Mary Poppins will still be here to enchant and entertain. This review is dedicated to my friend Jason.
One of Disney's very best musicals, Mary Poppins is an unforgettable children's classic. It combines memorable songs that get stuck in your head with the forward and sarcastic dialogue of the unsurpassable Poppins, and a psychedelic story that employs superbly integrated traditionally animated characters. Part fairy tale, part daydream, and all magic, the sights, songs and laughs propel this Academy Award-winning picture (Andrews took home the Oscar for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a whopping 13 golden boys - the most of any Disney film) to the top of the lists for the greatest family films ever made.<br /><br />The story begins with Bert (Dick Van Dyke) playing the role of guide and narrator, ushering the viewer to the home at 17 Cherry Tree Lane (as if inexperienced in the technique, the camera cuts on several occasions during the trip, taking the viewer out of the notion of following Bert). The sixth nanny in four months is about to dash out the door, upset at the constantly preoccupied Winifred Banks and her two misbehaving children who have once again gone missing. When Mr. George Banks (David Tomlinson) comes home, he's furious at the disorder, blames the kids and his wife, and insists upon personally hiring the next nanny. The two children, Jane and Michael, create their own list of requirements for the prospective woman, but George scoffs and throws the paper into the fireplace.<br /><br />The following morning, dozens of elderly ladies line the front yard, waiting for an interview for the newly open position. But with a powerful gust of wind, the lot of them is replaced by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), who descends from the clouds with her umbrella and carpetbag and, mysteriously, the children's list of preferences. Banks is all seriousness and professionalism, but he's no match for the tricky verbal wizardry of Poppins, who not only hires herself, but initially agrees only to a trial run. After dismissing the befuddled man of the house, she slides up the staircase (in a peculiarly reverse Exorcist-like manner) to meet the children, and unpack her empty carpetbag (pulling out a hat rack, mirror, lamp and more).<br /><br />Poppins uses magic and singing (starting off with the very famous "A Spoonful of Sugar" song) to tidy up their room (tables, toys and doors all flap about in another playful scene reminiscent of The Exorcist), and the trio departs for the park. There they meet Bert, who is creating chalk masterpieces on the sidewalk, and with a little more magical help from Mary Poppins, embark on a fun-filled adventure into his artwork - firstly on a jolly holiday in a picturesque English countryside (the kids are curiously absent for the first two lengthy sequences with dancing penguins and barnyard animals) which segues into a merry-go-round horse ride through the park that transforms into a fox hunt and then a derby.<br /><br />At first it seems that practically perfect (and rather vain) Mary Poppins is there to straighten out the wily kids; as the film progresses it's evident that Mr. and Mrs. Banks are the ones she's there to fix; George is a well-ordered man absorbed with his work, and rarely has time for his children and their unseemly hullabaloo (or the sugary female thinking of his wife), while Winifred is leading women's rights movements - an act contrary to her subservient attitude toward her husband.<br /><br />A cheerful creativity surrounds the whole film, from the laugh-filled tea party on the ceiling of Uncle Albert's home, to the senile but punctual admiral who commands a ship atop his house, to the tongue-twisting silliness of "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." The songs are some of the best in any of Disney's films, the mixing of traditional animation with the live action characters is fantastic, and Andrews' performance is (spit) spot-on. Although the running time is noticeably lengthy for a family film (the following year's The Sound of Music was, of course, even longer) and the scripting of Poppins changed drastically from the original story by P.L. Travers (for the better), it is one of the most memorable and delightful musicals from Walt Disney - one that hasn't aged and remains universally entertaining.<br /><br />- Mike Massie
Released in `64 `Mary Poppins' is without question one of the most beloved movies in Disney's vast vault of wonderful family film classics. I was twelve years old when `Mary Poppins' made its theatrical debut and I must admit that I immediately fell madly in love with Julie Andrews. Obviously I wasn't the only one considering the fact that Julie Andrews won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the magical nanny.<br /><br />This film is what family entertainment is all about; singing, dancing, cute kids, attractive nurturing adults, a zany but lovable character here and there and a heavy dose of enchantment and childish wonder. This is definitely a keeper by all means.
We here at home love this 40th anniversary edition of the film, Mary Poppins! It is spectacular! I adored the books when I was a child. My older sons loved the original Disney movie on video, and this DVD is being watched with the greatest delight by my younger children! With good reason! Even though this is an extremely long movie by present standards, it moves right along, is packed with fantastic, classic songs, amusing scenes, and even touching, poignant parts which will move you, zinging straight to your heart.<br />Julie Andrews, who rightfully won an Oscar for her role as the magical nanny who appears at "just the right moment" at the door of the discombobulated British Banks' family's household, teaches the children and their parents as well a thing or two about how to live properly. It's complicated to say what "living properly" means, exactly, unless you watch the movie...It has much to do with having fun as you do things you ought to be doing. It has to do with caring for other people's feelings, and also for taking a day off when you are least expecting to and having a fantastic adventure! The songs "Spoonful of Sugar", " Let's Go Fly a Kite", "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", "Feed the Birds," and Chim-Chimminee" are all so famous and so beloved it is quit easy to call up their tunes at a moment's notice, I expect.  If you haven't heard them lately, I suggest you get a copy of this really well done 40th anniversary edition and relive the first time, or times, you saw this movie. It is touching, and charming. Dick Van Dyke is fantastic as the appealing foil to Julie Andrews' character. You can tell Mary Poppins  adores him in his character (Bert, the chimney sweep) but must maintain her ladylike character -- it is truly sweet. Another charming and superbly played  part is that of Ed Wynn's in the scene which includes the song "I Love to Laugh". That is a great scene in every way! Incredible!<br /><br />The children and their family are beautifully cast; the ups and downs are believable, and easily coax you into caring about the plot. The movie is extremely well rounded. There is dancing, singing, and fantasy galore.  I cannot recommend this 40th anniversay version of Mary Poppins highly enough. I don't care how old you are! You will love this movie!
This movie is also a classic great for the entire family.  It can change an Adult into a kid and make a kid into a great Adult.  It places values on family that lack in the upbringing in moral fiber these days and teaches values that a nanny rarely teaches our current children of today with the exception of hola due to parents working there children's lives away in pursuit of money and Capitalism.  So please sit down with your own family and cherish feeding the birds or going to fly a kite or spending time with them before time spends you.
Excellent quality.  I also own a video tape of this movie and the clarity of the DVD is remarkable in comparison.  Special features are fun too.  I ordered it because my granddaughter loves this movie so much she has practically worn out the tape.  It is a fun movie and I am enjoying it again as much as I did when my daughter was young.
I love this movie, and now it is my three-year-old daughters' favorite too!
My kids love it!  The best part is that my wife and I can watch it with them, and we enjoy it too.  Thanks Julie Andrews!
