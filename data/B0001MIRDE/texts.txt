Actually, there's very little about Ek Hasina Thi that could be called "typical".  The principals (Urmila Matondkar, Saif Ali Khan and Seema Biswas) demonstrate remarkable versatility once again in roles that we're not accustomed to seeing them in.  Urmila as the "anti-heroine" or Seema as the tough as nails cop, isn't quite as unusual as seeing Saif in a role that's purely villainous.  Though a fairly long film (by American standards anyway) Ek Hasina Thi isn't replete with a lot of extraneous "filler" which is sometimes the case with Bollywood movies.  The pace and the suspense are well maintained throughout and even the fight scenes are believeable for the most part.  Well worth watching!
I was very eager to show this movie to my friend with English subtitle. Finally I got this DVD and we watched it. The movie is great. The print was good. I have nothing to complain.
Terrific revenge flick with outstanding performances from Saif Ali Khan and Urmila Matondkar, a vibrant and unusual screenplay, set in Mumbai, edge-of-your-seat stuff for 2 hours but doesn't feel anywhere near that long. No-frills DVD has clear images and good English subtitles. Definitely not your average Bollywood film; no song-and-dance numbers, just a solid plot and a deliciously uncompromising ending. Does he deserve the dark fate she wishes upon him? You be the judge!
I have watched the movie long time ago, and i enjoyed every moment of it, i was so glad i found it in amazon but when i ordered i was shocked to find that the box was simply empty! where was the DVD?!! i am so disappointed.
