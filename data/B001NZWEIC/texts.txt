Lakhan Singh strikes terror into the hearts of village people everywhere. But when his heart is tamed by a woman through her courage & tenacity who would believe it. So begins the tale of Samadhi a story of hardship & misfortune where Lakhan follows a pathway of self sacrifice to provide for his loved ones. But however hard he tries he cannot escape the shadow of crime that has blighted his existence, Happiness is always seems to be snatched away & replaced by remorse & anguish which forces him out of desperation back into the life of crime he was raised into. His only hope is to ensure that his child is not caught in the circle of deception that he is so effectively ensnared. If that means disassociating himself from the one thing that he values the most than so be it.
