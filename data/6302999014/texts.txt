As a practitioner of Sun Pakua, I am always happy to see any material on this rare art. Most Pakua is wushu oriented  with lots of flair and little substance.This style however came about back when Pakua was still a  fighting art.This tape gives a good representation of the form and power. I  would like to have seen much more applications. Other than that it was  pretty good.
