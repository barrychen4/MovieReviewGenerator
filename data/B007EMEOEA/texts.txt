Wow. I saw Safe House for Hollywood one night and the Yellow Sea the next. Yellow Sea blew it away
The Yellow Sea is a South Korean thriller. Gu-Nam is given the opportunity to clear his debt by killing a man in South Korea; a chain of unfortunate events occur that leave Gu-Nam as the target.<br /><br />The Yellow Sea starts off with a slow pace for the first hour. It's not dreadfully slow, but I think it's a bit slower than you'd expect if you're a fan of The Chaser. I loved the chase scenes in this film, the scale of them were significantly upgraded; whether Gu-Nam is being chase by dozens of police officers and several police cars at the same time or being chased by several thugs with knives and hatchets, the chase scenes were exhilarating and the definition of "edge-of-your-seat". The story is a lot deeper than what I mentioned previously, but I don't want to spoil anything. It really has amazing ending that breaks away from the Hollywood formula. The acting was brilliant, direction was great, and the music was amazing (the song at the credits was amazing; I sat through the credits just to listen to it!)<br /><br />I feel obligated to comment on the cut/uncut issues in this film. I have not seen the original full-length version and do not appreciate Fox International Productions cutting so much from this film. It messes with the filmmakers true vision and it shouldn't be acceptable (that is if they made these edits without the director's permission). But, this does not completely destroy the film. Also, another reviewer mentioned something about the movie feeling like it was cut from NC-17 to PG-13, again feel to obligated to mention, you should not watch this with anyone under 17; there are alot of bloody knife/hatchet fights and plenty of full nudity sex scenes to justify an R rating (although a bit exaggerated, I understand where the reviewer is coming from, it shouldn't have been cut in the first place). I only dropped the score 1 star because of the cuts, I personally don't feel like it's a 1 star movie. I would love to see the raw film, though.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend The Yellow Sea. It's another wonderful film from South Korea. As of 9/3/12, the cut version is available on Netflix Streaming.<br /><br />This film has strong violence and blood, it also has multiple sex scenes and nudity (the sex scenes are vivid).<br /><br />*I originally posted this review on the DVD version of this film.
EDIT: So sorry the folowing review is based on the full version and not the hacked to pieces offering that Fox have put out both on DVD and Az Instant Video. It is a 5 star film, but only when viewed in its entirity. Please see the reviews for the DVD that explain further, the full version with English subs is available in Region 2 from Az.UK<br /><br />This is a truly stupendous film that takes a while to sink in. It is South Korean (with sub titles) but starts its story in Yanju City in the Yanbian Province of China. This is an area next to the borders of North Korea, Russia and China, the local Koreans are referred to as Joseonjoks and Gu Nam (Ha Jung-Woo) is one such man. He has borrowed 60,000 Yuan to send his wife to a better life in Korea, but that was six months ago and he has not heard from her, most suspect that she is a bit of a flibbertigibbet and as such has dumped him and their daughter for the high life of making a living from lying down. He meanwhile has to repay the debt to some local low life's. The money he makes as a taxi driver is not a lot, so he augments this by gambling on Mah-Jong.<br /><br />However, he is as adept at gambling as a high wire actor with vertigo. Thus his debts start mounting, then he gets approached by local gangster and all round nasty bloke, Myun jung-Hak (Kim Yoon-seok), who offers him a wad of cash and a bank deposit account - without the Pin. He gets that on delivery of the thumb of a Korean man he wants to be `taken out', and I don't mean to a local restaurant.<br /><br />Thus he is despatched to South Korea, but things do not go as planned and whilst trying to find his wife and carry out the job, he unintentionally end up being on the wrong side of the Chinese mafia, the police and the Korean mob. What happens next is a movie so full of twists as to make your eyes water. We have some spectacular car chases, gory violence, manic man hunts and what can only be described as good old fashioned medieval butchery.<br /><br />Director and screenplay writer Hong Jin-Na has made a second great and original film, his first offering `The Chaser' was a debutante success and featured the above mentioned actors too. This has the same high end production values, and manages to keep the momentum up for most of the 157 minutes, though it could have benefitted from some editing in places. Some have criticised the many chase scenes too, but I found it edge of seat stuff and what appears to be more cars trashed than in the seminal `The Blues Brothers'.<br /><br />This is one for action, thriller, violence, conspiracy and intrigue lovers as well as any one who like World cinema, all of the acting is top notch and even though some may find it bleak, I actually went `wow' at the end - very highly recommended.
This movie was well worth watching.  There was a lot of violence in it, but there was a definite plot that made the viewer care about the fate of the main character.  The educational value of the film alone made it worth watching, for me.  I had no idea that the people in this part of the world had to live this way.  There were rich people who lived comfortably, but there didn't seem to be much of a middle class, and most people who had jobs lived meagerly.  But they still wanted the same things that most people want.  They had framed photographs of their weddings, complete with as many fashionable and nice clothes as they could manage.  They decorated their homes with as much comfort as they could.  Almost nobody of the main character's income level had a car.  That would be a luxury.  Their streets were often unpaved, their clothes cheap, their opportunities limited.
