Both documentaries were produced by Grizzly Adams. "The Heroes of Flight 93" was released in 2005, was hosted by Jerry Rose, and the narration was based upon "Beauty Beyond the Ashes" by Cheryl McGuiness. "Portrait of Courage" was released in 2006, was hosted by Michael Flynn, and the narration was based upon the book "Fighting Back" by Deena Burnett. "The Heroes of Flight 93" poses the question, "Where was God on September 11th?" while "Portrait of Courage" makes no mention of God. "The Heroes of Flight 93" includes in the Special Features; Curriculum: The Ultimate Act of Love; which is not included in the Special Features of "Portrait of Courage." The Special Features in "Portrait of Courage" includes Spanish subtitles, which "The Heroes of Flight 93" does not. Other than these differences, the interviews and Special Features between the two documentaries are virtually identical! For this reason, I recommend that you purchase one or the other, but not both. I personally prefer "The Heroes of Flight 93" over "Portrait of Courage," because I like the narration better in "The Heroes of Flight 93," plus it is less expensive to purchase on this site.
