I remember seeing this film 40 years ago.  It was<br />a classic then, its a classic now. A film for any<br />religion!
This film seemed daring (though still hagiographic) in its time (when I saw it in a cinema house at the time of its initial release), but it would have been much more shocking if it had revealed the full and at times seemy truth of the life of the high cleric, Cardinal Abp. William Henry O`Connell, whom the movie, and Henry Morton Robinson`s novel on which the screenplay is based, portray (loosely and discretely, avoiding both naming him outright or being too explicit). O`Connell was a prelate of great personal culture (whose musical accomplishments even included the composition of some fine church music) and of glamourously extroverted flair.<br /><br />Cardinal O`Connell lived a life of flamboyant splendour, but the expenses of his maintenance and retinue (and of some nepotism, too) derived to no small extent from his dips into archdiocesan finances (which were booming, in no small part to his shrewd management, despite the pilfering of funds therefrom for his own extravagant personal and extended family use). Cardinal O`Connell also was a secretive, practising homosexual. Of course, these shocking matters surpass even the titillations of Otto Preminger`s film!<br /><br />For "the straight skinny" (i.e., to inform yourself) see, above all, James M. O`Toole`s fine study (one of several in book form), "Militant and Triumphant: William Henry O`Connell and the Catholic Church in Boston, 1859-1944" (University of Notre-Dame Press, 1992), which confirms that the identity of the true-life priest turned prelate of the film, is, indeed, Cardinal Abp. O`Connell of Boston. The facts, albeit seemier, are even more fascinating than the fiction concerning this seminal prelatical figure of the Roman Catholic Church in the U. S. of A.<br /><br />Nonethess, on its own terms, the film is highly enjoyable, however much it romanticises Church life and its inner workings. There was a time when the Catholic Church merited the respectful homage that "The Cardinal", book and film, rendered to it, before the indignities and degradation of what ensued upon the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council. Those chages were to diminish drastically the life, inwardly spiritual and outwardly institutional and liturgical, of post-conciliar and trivialised Catholicism. Seeing this film, putting aside the personal shallowness of the real Cardinal O`Connell and of his careerist ilk, reminds the viewer of how much the world has lost with the regrettable developments and decline that so have diminished present-day Western Catholicism in ways far more detrimental to it than anything that the real Cardinal O`Connell of history could do to subvert it. There was a time, indeed, when the Roman Catholic Church had, to a large degree, the kind of moral grandeur and vibrant collective life and piety that the Cardinal, other clergy, and the faithful laity portrayed in this film call to memory so effectively.
Tom Tryon was a fantastic actor back when this movie was made and had starring roles in many other movies too. But Tom's passion was writing novels, which he was equally good at, and did for years after leaving the movie business. If you enjoyed the "Thorne Birds" you will enjoy this movie just as well. It has a brilliant cast, and for non-Catholics it offers a glimpse into the church hierarchy all the way up to the Vatican.
Director Otto Preminger fashioned a classic film about Catholicism in the 20th century by pulling no punches on some weighty issues.  He takes on adbortion, interfaith marriage, service, social justice, bigotry, church vs. faith, political endorsements, facism, socialism, and the value of the individual.  Tom Tryon gives an incredible as the obedient, questioning and stoic priest who rises to cardinal.  The supporting cast of Raf Vallone, Carol Lynley, Murray Hamilton, Patrick O'Brien, and John Saxon is stellar.  This is an amazing film that should be watched by anyone of faith.
Always enjoyed Tom Tryon in the Cardinal. Interesting perspectives on religion and life. Love the musical score.
If you want to enjoy a very pleasant time, view the Cardinal.  It covers a period during the the 20th century in a way that is both educational and entertaining.  The acting is excellent and the story holds one throughout.
i saw this movie year's ago and thought it was very moving. and very true to the thinking of the catholic church. brilliant acting. if you want a good cry, this is the one. and tom tryon is so handsome.
This film is the DeJa Vue of what is currently happening in our country today regarding maintaining Religious Freedom and identifying those who are backsliding from saying they support religious freedom and then turn around and oppose those moral values that religions uphold. View this film along with the film "For The Greater Glory" and you will see the reslemblence.
Watched this movie on television the other day and discovered that it was far better than the updated movie starring Christopher Reeves.<br /><br />Otto Preminger shows his masterful touch as director when he made this movie. At the very beginning he shows his ability to capture light, pattern and sound when you first see the priest walking presumably through the Vatican. There is an interesting interplay between light and shadow when you observe the many nuances of texture like and pattern showing the true beauty of this film.<br /><br />The movie also follows the book closely, with some minor variations, meaning the movie is well written as the book was also. Through both the book and the movie you see how a man rises from a simple background to become a prince in the Catholic Church.<br /><br />Acting in this movie is excellent as well is the music that provides background color.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
An energetic story of a Catholic priest that rises through the ranks of priesthood. The storyline embraces issues of faith and courage of conviction.<br /><br />Directed by Otto Preminger, John Huston plays a supporting role that nominated him for best supporting actor.<br /><br />Interestingly, Carol Lynley plays a duel role and Robert Morse (How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying) sings. Other notables include Burgess Meredith and Dorothy Gish.<br /><br />This DVD is powerful family entertainment and definitely worth the price.
47 years ago The Cardinal made its way to movie theatres featuring Tom Tryon in the title role. The fictional account of the a Catholic priest and his rise to being a Cardinal is first rate. Good storytelling and acting throughout this nearly three hour work. You don't have to be Catholic to appreciate The Cardinal....wonderful movie!
I remember reading The Cardinal in high school when I was in study hall.  I couldn't put the book down.  Then the movie!  Compared to the films of that time, The Cardinal held quite true to the book, making it a "Must See".  I went to see it seven times, and finding it on DVD at Amazon was beyond belief, as I had thought it was a lost film.  The quality is quite good, Tom Tryon was stiffer than I remember, but played the roll well.  The cast was outstanding, most of whom are gone now.  Ahh!  Memories.
The Cardinal is a gripping portrait of a young man's rise from priest to cardinal overcoming obstacles of faith and politics.  Always a rising star the young religious scholar has to face tough choices that test his faith.  It is his decision to remain faithful to his vows even at the expense of his pregnant sister and his own personal demons.  Despite politics of the Vatican he acheives the ultimate reward for his convictions.  He avoids the hypocrisy of the church in matters of belief.  He brings honor and honesty to a position that sometimes lowers itself to the least common denominator of expediency.  It is a redeeming experience even for those with questionable belief in the church.
Though this is a work of fiction, it is a well researched story on the catholic faith and the trials and tribulations of the catholic priesthood. It provides minute details of the efforts and frustrations of the American cardinals to participate in the election of th Pope owing to distance and constraints on travel and time during a period when travel to Rome took weeks.The film provides a good insight into the training of the priesthood. A must see for those wishing to learn more about the catholic faith.
A classical pre-vatican ll movie which grapples with isssues still faced today abortion, discrimination. The Austrian Church and it's involvement with Nazism is gently handled.<br /><br />A good moral reminder movie
This is a great movie, one of the best.  I have watched this movie several times on TV and a couple of days ago, I watched it on TCM.  I had forgotten how great Tom Tryon is as Father Foymolle.  The other actors, who did so well, in the roles that they portrayed were extremely good.  The music, for those who love movie music themes, was written by the same person who wrote the music for "The Big Country".<br /><br />It is well worth buying and a constant reminder of all the ill effects of the times back in the days after WWI and now.  There is a tremendous colliating of ill feelings that are felt by all of us in one time or another, and are still striving to deminish(sp).
The movie came in 3 days and in great condition.  I have always loved this movie.  For those who love Tom Tryon, it is one of his best.
Good to see A MOVIE that was pre vatican 2.It brought back lots of memories of Catholic worship.A wonderful piece of history that still goes on.
A fine example of the cinematic experience of that time. It's not Ben Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, but it is beautifully filmed, atmospheric, and dignified. There is a comfortable autumn day beauty and feel to this film, if that makes any sense to you. And the filming in Rome may be the finest I've ever seen. The performance by John Huston really stands out among a number of good performances. It tries to cover a great deal of a man's life, perhaps a little too much. But I find this easily forgiven. There aren't enough of these big, serious, voluptuous films of that era for me.
After so many years I wanted to see the "Cardinal" again<br />and it was refreshing to watch such a good movie with quality and moral.<br />I am glad I purchased it because now I can watch it any time I want.<br />I highly recommend this movie, we have lost in today's liberalism what<br />is right or wrong and not to respect commitment and this movie shows<br />that you should respect commitment and be true to your belief.<br />Visia
I truly enjoyed this movie and can watch it again and again.<br />When looking for a DVD's, the first place I look is Amazon.com. Good to great prices, they always provide the DVDS in record time.
Being raised a Catholic,it was interesting to se how things have changed.Those were tough times for us growing up,only we did'nt know it.Certain things you can't forget. Wonderful MOvie
TOM TRYON has the central role in Otto Preminger's majestic looking film version of THE CARDINAL, but he's one of those handsome actors with an impassive face whose emotions never come to the surface. Instead, we get a hint of what he might be thinking without any real clue. And since the film is all about the moral and personal issues facing him as he enters the College of Cardinals, an actor with more emotional capabilities would have been more impressive.<br /><br />The other flaw is the three hour length for a film in which the story is simply not that compelling. Furthermore, director Preminger has chosen to direct whole scenes at medium length lensing (no close-ups inserted) which gives a flat affect to the dynamics involved. The medium shots are symptomatic of many a film made in the then new WideScreen process with a scarcity of close-ups for important moments.<br /><br />Aside from these weaknesses, the film has a lot about it to commend. All the interiors of church activities are impressively staged and photographed in beautiful WideScreen photography. The performances around Tryon range from good to excellent, including John Huston, Carol Lynley, Bill Hayes, John Saxon and Burgess Meredith. Huston is particularly commanding as the brusque Cardinal Glennon, who confronts Tryon with: "You're not afraid of me, are you?" when the young man speaks his mind. Huston deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.<br /><br />All of the technical aspects of the film are professional, giving the story more credibility than it deserves from a rather lumbering script. The icing on the cake is the rich musical score by Jerome Moross.<br /><br />Holds the interest despite the length as it deals with a young man confronting bigotry, Naziism, and his own personal beliefs as he ascends the ladder of success in the Catholic Church.
I liked the movie. The acting was great. If I had a compliant, it would be the movie should have been a little longer.<br />They tried to do to much in the time. But it was a great movie tnat I will see over and over.
This is as good as I remember it when it was first released as a film in 1963.<br /><br />This quote says it all, even now: "The Cardinal, winner of a Golden Globe Best Picture Award and nominated for six 1963 Academy Awards - -."<br /><br />It was a softer and more genteel time with a sophistication we seem to lack now.
In employing the central character from Henry Morton Robinson's book as a brush for painting a landscape mural of the 20th century, Otto Preminger attempted too much and consequently accomplished too little.<br /><br />Preminger's Cardinal-in-the-making is a man who has just too much to do for a character in even such a long movie.  [...]<br /><br />In taking us along on the journey to Cardinal Fermoyle's fate, Preminger seemed compelled to demonstrate to us that the 20th century was awash in conflict between traditional values and a budding sexual revolution, that abortion debate was in our future, that Prohibition came and went, that the Western Hemisphere was earning the right to demand central billing on the world stage, that the Nazis were on the march (and, boy, were they a nasty lot).<br /><br />In the end, Father/Monseigneur/Cardinal Fermoyle feels more like a tour guide than a man of deep faith who learns first to understand, then humanize, then telegraph that faith to others.  One just has that feeling of pushing away from the table after a very big meal but still feeling hungry.  We get close, so very close, to the feeling that Fermoyle is a truly remarkable man of faith . . . but the fullness of the sensation remains just out of our grasp.<br /><br />The fault is primarily Preminger's, but just a wee bit of it might rest with Tom Tryon.  While he was generally up to the role, I kept thinking about another tall, dark, handsome actor who perhaps could have pulled a bit more substance from the role:  Cary Grant.  The scene in which Father Fermoyle holds up his collared garb and decides on the spot to forsake his love of a woman and return to the active priesthood was poorly directed and/or edited.  The revelation just sort of swooped in from somehwere off camera and went splat on the screen.  By not giving the actor much of a moment with which to work, it called forth more power from an actor than Tryon could produce with his too-inexpressive face.  Again, think Grant.<br /><br />Now -- after all this -- I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Landscape murals are not usually high art, but they can be very colorful and are almost always worth at least one viewing.  So it was with this movie.  It's a good, old-fashioned story, full of heart and color that simply never should have aspired to be an epic.  If we can forgive it for not being one, we might even find it worth watching again.
The DVD arrived on time and was in good shape...I enjoyed the movie and appreciated the early arrival. thanks jackie de Boisblanc
This movie was amazing. This deep and moving portrayal of a Irish American priest is honest and well done. It had profound statements and is a must see for everyone. It is a shame that this movie is un-known to most people for it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I have not read the novel of which this movie is based so I can't judge it on that. But standing alone it is a great movie. The story is excellant and is very thought provoking, giving us plenty to think about. A true classic.......<br /><br />Also this movie shows us what the church used to be like before Vatican 2 came along with all its scandals and turned the church upside down!!!
Though Henry Morton Robinson's book, on which this film was based, is not the work of a literary giant, its themes (see my review of the novel) were valid and strong. I have no idea what Otto Preminger intended in this film, but the characters and plot of the novel are totally distorted, eliminating the very themes that gave the original merit.<p>Stephen Fermoyle, who Robinson depicts as a dedicated and sincere priest whose downfall is a pride which it takes him many years to recognise, here is reduced to a chilly, stoic figure who seems totally remote. Though the novel also was inclined to excessive dramatics, in the film the very normal exercise of priestly ministry which gave the book some balance is all but gone.<p>Robinson's Stephen frequently needs to confront how his meddling in others' lives has harmed them, particularly in cases where he seems to have &quot;solved the problems&quot; which the others presented. For example, in the book Stephen is crushed by the pain of remembering that his making his sister Mona promise to no longer see her Jewish boyfriend (because it is making the family unhappy) lead to her leaving and ultimately becoming involved with a highly shady character who abandons her during her pregnancy. In the film, since the plot was re-worked so that Mona's fiance decides to convert to Catholicism, then is insulted when Corny Deegan calls him an &quot;honorary Irishman&quot; and leaves Mona, the impact is lost. Rather than seeing Stephen struggle with the raw pain of his meddling, we are given the impression that he hates himself for not allowing a craniotomy on the baby.<p>When Stephen does incorrectly assume he has solved a problem (in the book, with the penitent to whom he refuses absolution, James Splaine and Milky Lyons, to name just three other than the sister whose trust he betrayed), the book makes it clear that Stephen had been perfectly orthodox in the church teachings he presented. The honest message, that orthodoxy without pastoral sensitivity can be devastating rather than helpful, comes through. In the film, one gathers that a cold endurance test is the matter of faith.<p>The entire climax present in the book is equally lost. Robinson's Stephen never leaves the active priesthood nor engages in any sort of love affair. His attraction to a woman (as a &quot;would-be Lucifer&quot; who is only absorbed in what he knows he cannot have, since he never intends to leave his priesthood) is the crucial point in the novel, where Stephen, facing all, sees how pride has dominated his life. The film's &quot;leave of absence,&quot; and apparent consideration of marriage to a pretty student, gives the contrary view - as if he returned to the active ministry as a cold obligation.<p>Since each scene of the film is short and much material missing, the characters have no chance of being developed. It is merely a series of puzzling, often overly dramatic vignettes, as the sphinx-like Cardinal looks on.<p>Overall, this is one of the worst adaptations of a novel which I have seen onscreen.
This film, made a long time ago, is an old chestnut, but still there are some good bits in it.  If one likes pomp and ceremony, you will like this.
The Cardinal has one of the great soundtracks of any film of this size/length, and it has John Huston, about whom the entire film should have been about. A lying, prevaricating, domineering, proud, greedy, irreligious prelate that reflects what we know today about Cardinals and Bishops and Popes. Huston hits the mark of our time over and over, but the focus of this film is essentially the church justifying its fascism for God wants it that way for the time being, a fascism that includes the exclusion of all truth, so that scandals abound, but they are part of the crosses the Church must bear as well as create. Lies, truth, sex, power, embezzlement,etc etc are all in the hands of the church to do with as it wills. Too bad then\ laity disagrees, but they'll come around in time.<br /><br />I wonder what God thinks of all this? The Catholic Church would say,"If God disagrees, write out a big check for Him. He'll take it."
After I read the book by Henry Morton Robinson, I couldnt wait to see the film. What a disappointment! I wonder to this day where Preminger got his ideas for the screenplay,and why he eliminated most of Father Fermoyle's family. Although the acting is good, especially, Tom Tryon ,Burgess Meredith and John Houston, there is just no spark to this film. By using flashbacks, Preminger loses what thread of story that is left.<br /> Its too bad that he wasnt even a pinch more faithful to the book,his cast certainly could have handled it. And why oh why were the characters of Gaetano Orselli,Ghislana Falerni, and Roberto Braggioti in particular eliminated.  Did Preminger really<br />think that the character of Anne-Marie would help the plot?? Sorry Otto, that in itself is enough for a big thumbs down. Add it all up and you still get a big waste of time.
I love this movie because Tom Tryon is sooooooooooo handsome.  I like all of his movies, especially Moon Pilot.  He's very pretty and sexy in this movie and he's a good actor, too.  If you are a woman and have never looked at Tom Tryon, you gotta see him!!
