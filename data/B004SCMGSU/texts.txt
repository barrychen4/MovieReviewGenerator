The 1935 comedy A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is a grab bag of a movie that includes physical gags, verbal gags, a romantic subplot, backstage intrigue, an operatic aria, an elaborate dance number, stunts, absurdity, and sentimentality.  The main attraction is, of course, the patented zaniness of The Marx Brothers -- the acerbic Groucho, the mute Harpo, and the dim-witted Chico -- whose unique brand of comedy is often edgy, subversive, and even surreal and other-worldly.  Count me as one of those who thinks that such style of comedy loses some edge in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, where the comic trio seem out of place in a methodical plot, realistic settings, and among ordinary people.  These mundane elements are also, surprisingly, engrossing enough to often upstage the comedians.  Groucho's usual anti-establishment stance also seems softened in order to give way to crowd-pleasing sentimentality.  The Marx Brothers, like Jacques Tati, are creators of their own comic universes, and that's where they need to inhabit, such as in the whimsical delight DUCK SOUP, the Brothers' previous film, where their presence is more dominant.  With that said, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA does have some of most memorable gags in the Brothers' history.  A verbal confusion with Santa Claus, a tiny room cramped with 15 people, mixing opera with baseball, and Harpo's stunts with the ropes are some of the highlights.<p>The new Warner DVD of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is encoded for Region 1 and 4, and has a cleaner video transfer than I expected considering the age of the film.  Obviously, a video restoration has been done, as were the cases for many of recent Warner DVDs of old movies.  The original mono audio is fine, save for some age-related hisses in the background.  There are some jarring momentary losses of frames in a few places, such as in the scene of Groucho riding a carriage early in the movie.  However, I noticed these &quot;jumps&quot; in older video versions as well.  Both English subtitles and closed captioning are present for the film's dialogs.  The lyrics to the songs &quot;Alone&quot; and Cosi-Cosa&quot; are also captioned, but not subtitled.  During the Verdi opera sequence, the caption simply says &quot;[Singing in Italian].&quot;  French and Spanish subtitles are also provided, but, of course, many of the wordplays are simply lost in translation (&quot;C'est ce qu'on appelle une clause 'sanitaire'.&quot;) None of the supplements on the disc are subtitled or captioned, however.  <p>Leonard Maltin provides an engaging and informative audio commentary for the film.  He points out that the film was cut for its 1948 re-release (the version used for this DVD) in order to remove all references to Italy, which fought against America in WWII.  The original opening was supposed to be a musical number showing people in Milan singing, thereby establishing the setting of the film.  Although wishing to avoid analyzing the film, Maltin does try to elucidate some of the ingenious touches in the comical gags.  In the famous stateroom scene, he points out the way Groucho talks at just the right moments and all the people seem oblivious to the situation are what make the scene funny.  He praises the great pantomimic skills of Harpo, and thoughtfully suggests that although he might have been a great silent film star, his talent really belongs in a sound world.  He gives his thoughts on Chico's patently fake Italian accent.  He also laments that in the age of political correctness, Marx Brothers' films may seem pass&eacute;.  He says although there seems to be improvisations, the dialogs are often so intricately constructed that improvisations are often not possible.  He also recounts a few anecdotes, such as the Brothers' showing up naked in producer Irving Thalberg's office at one time.<p>The disc includes a typical half-hour making-of featurette &quot;Remarks on Marx, which is interesting, for me, mainly for the few minutes of appearance by Kitty Carlisle, who recalls how she was originally not allowed to sing with her voice.  A 20-minute musical short from 1937, &quot;Sunday Night at the Trocadero,&quot; is included, and it features performances by Connee Boswell, The Brian Sisters, George Hamilton and his &quot;Music Box Music&quot; Orchestra, and a cameo by Groucho.  The audio quality is so poor on this piece that I can only hear every other word.  An amusing ten-minute short &quot;How to Sleep&quot; from 1935, starring Robert Benchley, is also present, as well as the theatrical trailer for A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.  There is also a 5-minute TV appearance by Groucho in which he also recalls the naked incident in Thalberg's office.
Many have argued that A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is the Marx Brother's finest film, pointing out that it combined the best of the Brother's comedy with the biggest and boldest in MGM production values.  Personally, while I really like the film, I wouldn't quite put it in the top slot.  Any of the sequences containing the Marx Brothers themselves are gold, but I find that I'm not as enamored with the romantic subplot and singing as other reviewers have been (notably Leonard Maltin in this DVD's commentary).  Still, arguing about which one of the fine films is actually the best is a little pointless.  This is a great movie, regardless with how it compares to the others.<p>The biggest thing this film has going for it (outside of the wonderful Marx Brothers themselves, of course) is the big production values that MGM splashed out on.  I have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, it's nice to have some great big sets for the Brothers to clown around in (Harpo's stunt double swinging through the rafters is great), but all things considered, I think I prefer the tongue-in-cheek send-up of the big dance numbers (as done in DUCK SOUP) to the production dances which are played straight here.<p>Margaret Dumont is underused, which is a shame since her dignified outrage usually accounted for big laughs.  She gets a good scene at the beginning, and a handful of opportunities to look indignant later in the film, but she isn't the constant presence that she had been in other films.<p>Still, while I can pick out a few flaws here and there, this is overall a hilarious and fun movie.  Much of what is considered classic Marx Brothers material is from this film: the too-many-people-in-the-stateroom scene, the Marxian deconstruction of a legal contract (if anyone thinks that &quot;'The party of the first part' shall be known in this contract as 'the party of the first part'&quot; isn't realistic, then I can show you fine print I've received from credit card companies that are even more tautological than that), and, of course, the grand finale wherein the three brothers completely destroy an opera-in-progress.<p>The DVD also contains an all-new documentary, which features (among other people) co-star Kitty Carlisle, who is amazingly sharp for being in her 90s, and Dom DeLuise, who talks a lot about food and appears to have been interviewed in the middle of making breakfast (no, I'm not sure why he's here).  This is mostly a talking heads interview documentary and there's not a whole lot of brand new material or trivia, but it is nice to see some differing perspectives on things.  The story of how Groucho got his name contradicts the anecdote given on the commentary track, and Carlisle refutes the conventional wisdom that states that Margaret Dumont didn't get any of the jokes Groucho was bouncing off her.  <p>A short except from a 1961 broadcast of &quot;The Hy Gardner Show&quot; (who?) reveals Groucho recounting the story of he and his brothers stripping naked and roasting potatoes in the office of Irving Thalberg after the famed producer kept them waiting once too long.  I trust you will enjoy the anecdote, because it's told a whopping three times during the course of these DVD extras.  Shockingly, none of the tellings blatantly contradict each other.<p>Two shorts have been included as extras, though I'm not sure I understand their relevance.  Robert Benchley's HOW TO SLEEP won the Academy Award in 1935 for Best Short Subject/Comedy, and it's certainly entertaining enough.  As for the other short, SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE TROCADERO, well, I'm baffled.  I can't make heads or tails of it.  Set in a nightclub, a Hollywood talent scout is visiting this ritzy affair.  Numerous song and dance people are attempting auditions, while the club's doorman is trying to impress by doing very bad celebrity impersonations (it didn't help that half the time I didn't recognize the name of the person he was impersonating or the name of the person people actually thought he was doing).  Cameos by stars of the day abound by having the camera cut to different tables and a voice over shouting, &quot;Hey, look!  It's Bob Has-been!&quot; (or whoever).  It isn't helped by the fact that most of the careers of these minor celebrities ended soon after the shoot, so for me I was watching cattle call of anonymous hotshots.  I couldn't figure out why these people were appearing as themselves.  Was the audience supposed to believe that these people really hang out at this fictional locale?  Groucho Marx (out of character and costume) has a three-second cameo where he looks as confused as I felt.<p>I'm wary of commentaries performed by people who weren't actually born when the film they're talking about was made, but Leonard Maltin does a fine job here.  He relates a lot of anecdotes about the Marx Brothers, points out how the script is layering the subplots, and relates a lot of trivia that I had never heard before (for example, the only surviving print is actually an edited version made during WWII when all references to Italy have been removed, which explains why the film bizarrely never tells you were the first scenes are set).  He even gets into the fun, shouting &quot;What a twit!&quot; when the evil opera singer refuses to sing on the cruise-liner for free.<p>Although the DVD of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is included in &quot;The Marx Brothers Collection&quot; box set, it is also available for individual sale.  Although I slightly prefer A DAY AT THE RACES (also out on DVD now), I couldn't recommend anyone not pick up this film.  For Marx novices, there's a great movie.  For Marx aficionados, there's informational material that may be enjoyed.  In any event, the powers that be have given a great film an excellent treatment on the DVD format.
Many think this film the best or one of the best the Brothers Marx ever did.  It's probably a matter of taste (well, it's certainly a matter of taste), but I think the first MGM comedy by the Marx Brothers is scattershot.  Groucho, Chico and Harpo are in top form, and when they're on -- and allowed to dominate a scene -- the film is terrific.  The stateroom scene is still funny after 70 years, and the finale at the opera is Marxist anarchy at its finest.  <p>But when they're off screen (at least a third of the movie), you're left with an embarrassing melodrama I'm sure the movegoing audiences of 1935 found as sappy as I did.  Bad enough the young Italian lovers sound like they're from New England section of Italy; worse are the musical interludes, which bring the film to a halt and destroy any comedic momentum the Marxes have created.  A scene where Chico, Harpo and Jones show off their musical prowess goes on far too long and completely stops the film.  Their earlier comedies had musical interludes, but they were woven into the films better.  The opening number in Duck Soup, for example, is a lengthy set-up to the first joke; ditto the &quot;We're Going to War&quot; number.  When the young lovers in A Night at the Opera sing &quot;Alone,&quot; there's nothing but the youngsters staring moonily at each other.  Their voices are fine, but the studios of the time were never short of movies with beautiful youngsters singing to each other.  It's unnecessary here, and it reminds you the Marx Brothers aren't on screen.  <p>&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was the Marxes' most successful comedy at the box office, and probably the most popular film they ever did.  But time has been kinder to their earlier Paramount productions.  Those films are stagebound, but they have a madcap energy the MGM films never recovered.  <p>If you're a real fan of the Marx Brothers, you've probably already seen this; the rest of you should start with Duck Soup or Horse Feathers.  A Night at the Opera was, unfortunately, the beginning of the end for this legendary team.
What is there to say about a comedy classic? A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (1935) is great, a real treat to be savored each and every time one watches it. Although brother Zeppo is missed (he'd retired from acting to become an agent), I do enjoy handsome Allan Jones as male love interest.

She seems even in her youth to exude an unapproachable upper class snobbery that really chills a viewer. It's no surprise to me that Miss C.'s miniscule screen career went cold after this movie, and she only made one more appearance almost a decade later, again with Jones, in a now-forgotten UNIVERSAL programmer called LARCENY WITH MUSIC (1943).

Pictured here is the VHS edition of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (1935) that I bought some decades ago. This SP speed tape is stored in an oversized case with a hinged front panel, and sits securely in a black plastic retainer. A very top line item in its day, my tape still performs perfectly and I recommend this VHS without hesitation!<br /><br />As for the movie, what can you say about a comedy classic?

For those of you looking for a great introduction to the brilliant physical comedy (as well as one liners) from the late, great, and legendary Marx Brothers, this film is for you!  A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is nothing short of hilarious, as well as beautiful to listen to!  This features soprano Kitty Carlisle, as a young opera star, who runs into the Marx Brothers along the way--or, specifically Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx), a "hanger on" who continues to pursue an elderly socialite, Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont).  He and his rowdy crew of accomplices--er, assistants--help to bring the beautiful opera singer together with her lover, as well as with critical acclaim.  What's more, some of the most beautiful and well-known opera arias are interspersed between the zany shenanigans (this includes "The Anvil Chorus" and "Miserere" from IL TROVATORE).<br /><br />Some of the scenes from this film have often been replicated in films, as well as television, but no one does it quite as well as the Marx Brothers.  They truly put the physical comedians of today to shame.  There is a reason that A NIGHT AT THE OPERA has been the recipient of numerous honors on top film lists.  Be sure to see it.  I have no doubt that you will enjoy it!
Arguably their finest film . This is as good as it gets . Arts Patron Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont 1882-1965) intends to pay pompous opera star Lasspari  ( Walter Wolf King 1899-1984) 1.000 USD per performance hey , maybe that's why they call it GRAND OPERA ! . Grand comedy , too , as Groucho Marx (1890-1977 , Chico 1887-1961 , Harpo 1888-1964 cram a ship's staterom and more with wall-to-wall gags, one-liner , musical riffs and two hard-boiled eggs -all while skewering Lasspari's schemes and helping two hopefuls (Kitty Carlisle 1910-2007 and Alan Jones 1907-1992 ) get a break . To save the opera , our heroes must first destroy it . And they must also gain ocean passagenger as stowaways , pull the wool (if not the beards) over the eyes of City Hall , shread legal mumbo-jumbo  into a sanity Clause , pester dowager Claypool (Dumont) and unleash so much glee that many say this is the best Marx Brithers movie . Seeing is believing . High Quallity transfer . Recommended .
IF YOU LIKE THE MARX BROTHERS, THIS IS GREAT. SOME OF THIER BEST STUFF.
"A Night at the Opera" (1935) remains one of the Marx Brothers' finest efforts and a comic masterpiece. However, the seeds of the Marxes' creative demise were planted in this particular film: the strong focus on music and romance; the gradual softening of the brothers' comedic personas; and the MGM studio gloss at odds with Marxian anarchy. Thanks to the guiding hand of producer Irving Thalberg, everything clicks in "A Night at the Opera." Groucho, in particular, is brilliant and razor-sharp. Harpo's freewheeling spirit has been toned down, yet he has some truly inspired moments. In the immortal role of Herman Gottlieb, character actor Sig Rumann makes a welcome addition to the Marx Brothers stock company. A splendid night is guaranteed for all.
&quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; is tied with &quot;Duck Soup&quot; at being the #1 best Marx brother movie! Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) with Fiorello (Chico) and Tomasso (Harpo) try to get opera newcomer Ricardo Baroni (Alan Jones) to be the center of the New York Opera company instead of Rodolfo Lasparri. On the night debut of Lasparri in New York, Groucho makes a very funny speech before the opera starts. He concludes with, &quot;Let there be dancing in the streets, drinking in the saloons, and necking in the parlor. Play, Don.&quot; The result: one hilarious evening complete with a baseball game skit, a scenery change during the opera, Lasparri's kidnapping, and Baroni becoming the star of the opera with Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) back in the biz. Excellent Marx Brothers masterpiece!
This film is definitely the best I've seen of the Marx Brothers. Some scenes were so funny I had to pause the video so I could continue at the same place after laughing for so long. I didn't want to miss one minute of this movie. I really didn't think I'd like it all that much, but now I can't stop recalling funny scenes and laughing whenever I see it in a video store.
Pompousity is punctured, authority flaunted and chaos is wreaked in grand style as the Marx Brothers save the day for two young opera singers.  All the elements of a good Marx Brothers movie are here: Groucho's wisecracks  and chicanery, Chico's happy-go-lucky attitude and effortless but excellent  piano playing, and Harpo cutting up, and magnificently playing the Harp.  The opera singing, Especailly from Ms. Carlisle, is top notch.
Although I think &quot;Duck Soup&quot; is the funniest movie ever made, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is probably each of the brothers at their best.  Groucho zings and sings to the dismay of anyone who is unlucky enough to provide him the opportunity.  But in this movie, his timing and air are perfectly tuned to insult yet keep just a hair away from the mean side.<br />Harpo gives the villains expert come-up-ingness and goes from angelic to demonic with unadorned glee.  He keeps the Grouch and Chic chemistry together seamlessly and of course plays  wonderfully as always.<br />Chico is the toughest clown for me to figure out since he goes from comic to straight man and back again and you never know which one you're going to get.  But in this movie his wit outshines them all, whether he's not going to believe in the &quot;Sanity Claus&quot; or if he's figuring out how to out-outwit Groucho in his take for being a manager.<br />All this and a story with some good singing by Kitty Carlyle and Allan Hale and Margaret Dumont dowages perfecly.<br />And two hard boiled eggs...
The first two Marx Brothers films, THE COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS, were essentially filmed versions of their great successes on the New York stage.  MONKEY BUSINESS, HORSE FEATHERS and DUCK SOUP were specifically created for the screen on the soundstages of Paramount Studios--but when the latter proved a critical and box office fiasco the comedy team found their careers on very uneven ground.<br /><br />Enter Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  Thalberg was not known for his comedies and MGM, with its emphasis on prestige pictures and family fare, was an extremely unlikely venue for the brothers, but Thalberg was certain he could pinpoint the reason for their sudden and unexpected failure: DUCK SOUP, and to a certain extent all their previous films, lacked appeal for middle American audiences.  The Marx Brothers (without Zeppo, who retired from the act when they left Paramount) signed on the dotted line, Thalberg put the machinery of MGM behind them, and the result was A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.<br /><br />What Thalberg did, essentially, was to place the anarchy of the Marx Brothers at the disposal of romantic subplot.  Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) has promised to get Mrs. Claypool "into society"--for a fee, of course--and has arranged for her finance a season at The New York Opera.  What Mrs. Claypool gets for her money is tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter King), an unsavory man who is sweet on soprano Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle), who is in turn in love with tenor Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones.) When Lassparri attempts to trump Baroni both on stage and in Rosa's affections, Baroni's friends Fiorella (Chico) and Tomasso (Harpo) enter the fray. Throw in an impressario (Sig Ruman), three famous aviators, a herd of New York police officers, and an opening night, and before you can sing a chorus of Figaro that special brand of Marx Brothers mania holds full sway.<br /><br />Marx Brothers fans argue a great deal about which was better: the Paramount films or the MGM films?  I tend to come down on the side of the Paramount films, in which the humor tends to have a sharper edge, but there's no denying the charm of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.  A list of the film's famous moments would require a catalogue, with the legendary "stateroom scene" merely one in a hilarious sequence.  The supporting cast is also quite fine; Margaret Dumont is, as always, excellent; Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones are charming indeed.  It's all tremendous fun.<br /><br />The DVD release, which is available on its own or in a package of the Marx Brother's MGM films, is more than respectable.  The film was cut during World War II and the edited scenes seem lost forever; it is therefore occasionally abrupt, but even so it all hangs together extremely well, and while the print has not been restored per se it is quite good.  The DVD bonus package includes a brief documentary and several vintage shorts, but the real prize is the audio commentary by Leonard Maltin, who is both amusing and informative in the way I wish all commentators would be.  If you are in the mood for outrageous farce, you couldn't make a better choice.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
This is simply one of the greatest comedies ever made. The Marx Brothers are manic in this incredible farce concerning an opera company, an ocean voyage, a love story and of course Groucho wooing, mooching etc Margaret Dumont.<br /><br />The sight gags are fantastic and the music is of a higher quality then just about all of their others.<br /><br />The supporting cast does a great job and the shipboard stateroom scene is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />This is one of the best investments you will ever make as it is impossible to get sick of this picture or of the humor within it.<br /><br />Buy it at once!
This is one of the funniest movies of all time. There are several routines in the film that are classic.  We need MGM to release a DVD edition!!
Though I don't like "A Night at the Opera" as much as the Brothers' "Duck Soup" and "A Day at the Races" (for some reason it feels too static to me, and a bit claustrophobic, like that famous state-room scene), this is still a terrific film. In fact, to think that that state room scene is still a hoot almost 80 years later! Amazing! Anyone who's a fan of the Marx's (and even those who aren't) should have a blast with this film and the others mentioned above, what with the charming word play, and the endless chaotic shenanigans that are the hallmark of the boys known as Marx. (Btw, even with all the verbal linguistics going on, I always thought Harpo was the cutest of them all.) It's a pity we don't see this kind of cleverness in Hollywood comedies today.
A Night at the Opera is one hour and thirty-six minutes and was released in theaters on November 15, 1935. This movie has some firsts to it. It was the very first movie the brothers did after Zeppo has left the group. It was the first movie the brothers did for Warner Brothers after they were let go by Paramount Pictures and finally this movie would be the first of a long line story plots. In their first five pictures the Marx Brothers were just zany and would insult the good and the bad. Starting with A Night at the Opera till their final movie Love Happy the Marx Brothers would only insult the bad people and come to the rescue of the innocent. Lastly this is the first movie to feature the first of many fake Zeppos; at least that what film historians call them.<br /><br />I am not got into the plot of the movie because I am sure that a few other reviewers gave away the whole story. The as a trio this would be the Marx Brothers finest and the only to come close to (performing as a trio) is A Day at the Races. After A Day at the Races the quality of the Marx Brothers goes down hill big time. A Night at the Opera is know for two main scenes; the stateroom and contract scenes. One other footnote the Marx Brothers went on tour acting out part of the scenes to see what was and was not funny. A Night at the Opera gets an AAAAA+++++.
"A Night at the Opera"(1935) is the first MGM film made by the Marx brothers after leaving Paramount, and it is the first Marx Brother's film without Zeppo. This was also a sort of comeback film for the Marx brothers after a poor response from their previous movie "Duck Soup". Interestingly enough this film later had about three minutes clipped from the beginning by the censors when it was shown for the soldiers during WWII because the intro mentioned that the setting was in Milan, Italy, which the U.S. was at war with. Evidently these three minutes have been lost forever.<br />This film featured some classic moments in comedy, like the Sanity Clause repartee between Groucho and Chico, where they rip a contract down to nothing except for a Sanity Clause. There is also the classic stateroom scene in Groucho's tiny ship quarters and the ensuing mayhem, as everybody from plummers, to waiters, to chamber maids, to the manicurist, to the other two Marx brothers, go about their business in the very tight confines of Groucho's room.<br />This is the Marx brothers at their best.
Mrs. Claypool wants to put on an opera to make her way in high society and Mr. Driftwood plans to spend as much of her 8 Million dollars as he can by accommodating her.  The gags fly as well as the Marx Brothers!  Margaret Dumont uses Groucho to make her place in society when it is apparent to everyone that he is just using her money, he even states it.  What makes the movie so special isn't the two lovebirds or the story, but how the Marx Brothers work together and create gags.  It is very special.  Apparently Irving Thalberg was an MGM executive who understood them and allowed them to work.
I gave this film five stars. Why? Because it is one of their funniest films. Why? Because it hits the mark. Yes their other films are funny and entertaining, but this one in particular was always my favorite.
Watch the opening sequence of A Night at the Opera and you will see Groucho Marx at the height of his powers. A series of brilliant one-liners, all delivered with impeccable timing. Effortless comedy that was an influence on generations of comedians to come. Remember this was made in 1935!<br /><br />This is certainly in the same league as Duck Soup and probably better than A Day at the Races. The elongated 'sanity clause' joke, the state room scene on the boat, the detective in the hotel and the set piece at the opera near the end are amongst the best things the Marx Brothers ever did.<br /><br />Some of the musical numbers appear a little dated, but this was the era of Busby Berkley and so these were expected. It also gave the other to brothers a chance to show off their musical skills as well. But most of all it is Groucho who steals the show, and he is the main reason to watch the film, good as some of the supporting actors are.<br /><br />This is now part of a great boxed set which is better value for money.
This is my all-time favorite Marx Bros comedy.  It's definitely worth the price. I think it's enjoyable for a large age range.  If you've never watched a marx bros comedy before, this should be one of your firsts!
I didn't fully appreciate this film until my second viewing. Now I think it's one of the better Marx Brothers film. The film - filled with funny lines - has all the familiar MB trappings: good slapstick, good and bad jokes and routines, wild scenes, several musical numbers and general overall chaos.<br /><br />The only thing not appealing to me in the film were some of the songs - not all, just some. Otherwise, it was all fun as Groucho, Chico and Harpo all share humorous lines and/or sight gags. This is the film with the famous scene involving a ton of people being stuffed into Groucho's small cabin room. It's more amazing than funny. My favorite scenes were when Groucho and Chico got into discussions and trade lines back-and-forth. I also laughed heartily at the finale with Harpo swinging like Tarzan at the opera house.<br /><br />In all, a funny MB film, one of the boys' better efforts. I play it with the English subtitles so as not to miss any of the great lines of dialog in here. In fact, that's not a bad idea for any of the Marx Brothers films, because the jokes are delivered so fast, you might miss some of the hilarious comments.
When the Marx Brothers came to MGM in 1935, boy wonder producer Irving Thalberg had the good commercial sense to package them in a genuine musical comedy. Their anarchic comedy may have been slightly better served in some earlier Paramount comedies but never were they better showcased than here, their most popular film because of the balance of entertainment on offer and the quality of the production values provided by MGM, the Rolls Royce of film studios at the time.<br /><br />For those who know the Marx Brothers, there is little to say.  Furthermore, there are lots of excellent Amazon reviews which can fill you in. For young people who may not know the team, do yourself a favour and have a look. You may baulk at the love interest sub plot and the music but don't miss some of the very best comedy ever - the stateroom sequence is as hilarious today as it was when it first appeared. The Brothers were specialists at sending up pomposity and convention and setting them among the New York Opera set was a great idea.<br /><br />This DVD is a comprehensive package. The weakest aspect is that typical of the MGM films which appear on DVD, it has not been restored and is grainy and dirty in parts. Also, there are clearly a few places where the film splicing is less than perfect with jumps in the continuity.<br /><br />The extras, however, are excellent. Leonard Maltin provides a beautifully paced commentary, confining his comments to suitable background information and the sheer pleasure at the delights on view. It was particularly interesting to learn that the film was cut when it was reissued during World War 2 when every reference to Italy was removed. I have never understood why the film starts so abruptly and now I do. I can't help but hope that the cut footage may one day re-appear. An adequate documentary is included, the best of which has clips of Kitty Carlisle Hart who played the romantic lead. Ms Hart was a very elegant elderly woman with excellent memories of the film and its subsequent elevation to genuine classic - delightful. Dom Deluise appears too and he is embarassing. The DVD also includes a Robert Benchley short which is droll and amusing and an Oscar winner. The other short is a promotion for the Trocadero restaurant and it is worth seeing singer Connie Boswell but the rest is awful. Last of all, there is a portion of a TV interview with Groucho in which he tells my favourite Marx Brothers story. Don't miss it.<br /><br />This is an good package of a timeless comedy but the print should have been restored.
I happened to catch this on tv the other day and I thought it was pretty good. Groucho Marx is extremely funny! I need to see more of his material eventually, but that's another story for another time. Groucho plays Otis B. Driftwood, which was used in Rob Zombie's 'The Devil's Rejects' Groucho, Harpo, and Chico screw up an opera until Riccardo and Rosa become known. If you love classic comedy, you'll love A NIGHT AT THE OPERA!!!
The opera finale is the greatest comic scene ever put on film.  Throughout, all aspects of human activity  are reduced to absurdist rubble by the brothers. Economically told with musical scenes that are well integrated.  Pay close attention to Groucho's sexual innuendo throughout.
Certainly one of the finest Marx Brothers comedies, which are themselves among the finest Hollywood productions, with script by George S. Kaufmann. The three characters are admirably seconded by Margaret Dumont, the unflappable grande dame, and the great character actor, Herbert Gottlieb. Kitty Carlisle [Hart] and Allan Jones do a wonderful duet ALONE.<br />It is no wonder that T.S.Eliot, when he met Groucho, could only talk about this film.
A Night At The Opera is indeed one of the greatest films starring The Marx Brothers. The plot moves along at a good pace; the acting is convincing and the gags are timed to perfection. The actors are well cast and the script shines. Harpo Marx even does his own stunts! Who could ask for anything more?<br /><br />The action begins presumably in Italy or somewhere in Europe when Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) has increasing difficulty mooching off a wealthy older woman named Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont). Driftwood is supposed to introduce Mrs. Claypool to high society; but all he ever actually does is take his paycheck and stall Mrs. Claypool. Mrs. Claypool is running out of patience; she wants Driftwood to introduce her to high society now that her wealthy husband died and left her eight million dollars. (Why she does this four years after he died and not sooner is left unexplained.) Unfortunately, Otis Driftwood is great at cracking one liners at the expense of Mrs. Claypool--that is, until Mrs. Claypool meets Herbert Gottlieb (Sig Ruman). Eventually Mrs. Claypool is convinced to make a generous donation to an opera company also under the control of Herbert Gottlieb. They sail to New York with Gottlieb's promise to Mrs. Claypool that his star tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) will be a huge financial success. Then Mrs. Claypool will finally look wonderful in the eyes of high society--and Gottlieb just might get his hands on Mrs. Claypool for her money.<br /><br />But complications arise: Otis Driftwood and two of his peers (Harpo Marx and Chico Marx) tag along on the ocean voyage to America; ever hopeful to win Mrs. Claypool back from the snobby Herbert Gottlieb. Yet another stowaway comes along--Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones) because he loves opera singer Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) even though Rosa is loved and pursued by star tenor Rodolfo Lassparri himself.<br /><br />What will happen next? Will they all get to America safely? Will the police have to be brought in? How will The Marx Brothers' characters and Ricardo try to convince or manipulate Gottlieb so that Ricardo can be in the opera starring alongside his sweetheart Rosa Castaldi? Will they succeed? No spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!<br /><br />Many reviewers have correctly pointed out the funniest scenes in this movie already; so I won't risk boring you with too many details of them. The choreography shines in the classic stateroom scene in which everyone crowds into Otis B. Driftwood's cabin onboard ship; and the cinematography exceeds my expectations with song and dance numbers including Cosi Cosa on the steamship to America.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a commentary by Leonard Maltin; and Kitty Carlisle is one of several interesting people who add their own commentary in extra features. You also get Robert Benchley's comedy short entitled How To Sleep and there is another extra short called Sunday Night At The Trocadero with Connie Boswell and a brief cameo by Groucho.<br /><br />If anybody tells you to skip this film, ignore their advice. A Night At The Opera shines as the very best example of The Marx Brothers doing comedy on film; and the performances by Kitty Carlisle, Sig Ruman and Walter Woolf King enhance the quality of the movie.<br /><br />Enjoy!
This, the first and best of the team's MGM releases, features more focus on plot, musical numbers and romance than their earlier, wonderfully pure Paramount outings, but the results are still first-rate, with a splashy MGM production and a well-balanced romantic subplot (featuring a lovely young Carlisle) complementing some of the team's zaniest antics, including that immortal stateroom scene, and the impromptu baseball game during the opera.
We'll leave the "which-is-the-best-Marx-brothers-movie" argument to the philosophers. As a long-time Marx Brothers fans, my wife and I recently showed this to our 11- and 9-year old children. We all loved it. My son was laughing so hard after the stateroom scene that we had to pause the DVD ... so he could race off to the bathroom! ;-)<br /><br />My daughter enjoyed the whole movie, finding the scene in the apartment particularly hilarious.<br /><br />My wife and I laughed the entire time.<br /><br />Forget Shrek ... and Monster's Inc ... and the kid's movie du jour. For the real classics in humor, show your children A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.
This is a review for the VHS tape of the MGM film of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (1935) dby Sam Wood starring the Three Marx Brothers, Kitty Carlysle, Allen Jones, Walter Woolf King, Sig Ruman, Margaret Dumont.<br /><br />The Marx Brothers --Groucho, Chico, and Harpo star in their most successful and in some minds, their best film. Produced by the legendary Irving Thalberg whose touch of genius was to lay on the schmaltz as thickly as possible and keep the brothers three  under control as much  possible, except for the comedy.<br /><br />And the comedy is the main reason most anyone would want to watch A NIGHT AT THE OPERA today. All three Marxes are at the top of their form with one famous scene after another, more than enough material to fill two movies for "normal" performers.<br />Each time one of the brothers takes center stage I decide that he is really the best.<br />The truth is all three were tops at what they did and in this film they had the likes of George S. Kaufman, Morrie Ryskin, Al Boasberg and even uncredited Buster Keaton, among others, building gags alongside the story for them.<br /><br />In A NIGHT AT THE OPERA the brothers become secondary characters when romance rears its romantic head and that, more than anything, kind of bothers me.<br />Here's where we need Zeppo, to carry the torch of Marxian romance and desire, just for the neatness of keeping it all in the family and to avoid having the brothers slip into becoming even for a few minutes, just an element of an ensemble cast.<br /><br />Another problem with A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is some of the scene transitions are kind of jerky if not downright abrupt, not what you'd expect from MGM. Maybe the powers that be made some last minute cuts in the film and did not have the time to do a smooth editing job. If that's true wouldn't be something to see those out takes?<br /><br />And finally, for years I have actively disliked the music in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. But now that I have aged just a slight bit, I find it kind of pleasant and portions of it somewhat interesting. Also, as the years have passed, I have been able to forget TV's "To Tell The Truth" or whatever quiz show Kitty Carlysle appeared on and now can appreciate her for the remarkable beauty and fine singer she really was. I wonder if Chico noticed.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, a five star film,  stands only slightly  behind DUCK SOUP in the chorus line of high stepping Marx Brothers classics, which ain't bad by anyone's standards." With a Hey Non Nonny And a Hot Cha Cha."
After 70 years, "A Night At The Opera" is still considered one of the finest comedy films ever made, and is often called the funniest film the Marx Brothers ever made; there's also a handful of fans who consider "A Day At The Races" to be the funnier of the two. Die-hard fans already have them both in the five-disc box set; if you've only got room on your shelf for one Marx Brothers film, this review should help you decide between the two.<br /><br />Both films were supervised by Hollywood genius Irving Thalberg, who realized that the Marx Brothers' raucous style of humor was not enough to sell tickets; it was his insistence on adding glamour and romance that made the films successful. Both films feature Allan Jones as the handsome singer who needs a break so he can marry his sweetheart. Both films feature Groucho and Chico as fast-talking con artists; Groucho swindles Margaret Dumont while Chico swindles Groucho. Both films feature Harpo as a mischevious mute who is sadistically whipped by the villain. Both films end in surrealist chaos, devilishly orchestrated by the brothers Marx. Of course, all is forgiven before the closing credits roll.<br /><br />In "Night", Margaret Dumont can barely tolerate Groucho's incompetence; in "Day", she blindly ignores it because she's in love with him, allowing him to get away with a lot more comic mischief. In "Night", Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle are both given ample time to sing, bringing the action to a halt; in "Day", Kitty is replaced by the non-singing Maureen O'Sullivan, a better actress who never wastes screen time with a sappy duet. In "Day", the Marxes get revenge on crooks who want to fix a horserace and build a casino, in "Night", they get revenge on a mean opera singer who wants to steal Allan's girl, making him less of a villain and more of a pest. The songs in "Night" are far more tolerable than the music in "Day", but let's face it - the only songs you need in a Marx Brothers movie are the ones played on piano and harp.<br /><br />Extras on the "Night" disc include a witty essay on curing insomnia by humorist Robert Benchley, along with a Leonard Maltin commentary track. His remarks lack the spontaneity and informality of the commentary track for "Day", suggesting that it was scripted by Maltin or his research staff. At one point, he suggests that sharp-eyed viewers may be able to spot the father of the Marx Brothers twice in one scene: first on a pier and again on a ship. My research indicates that he could not have appeared in this 1935 film, as he had passed away two years earlier. Maltin may have confused this scene with a similiar one in "Monkey Business". There's also a rare talkie for star-gazers featuring cameos by dozens of MGM contract players, including one Julius Marx (aka Groucho sans moustache) but most of the dialogue is muffled or inaudible.<br /><br />Although both films are highly enjoyable with a higher-than-average amount of laugh-out-loud moments, I'm giving "Day" a slight edge over "Night" on the basis of its comedy-to-music ratio. In addition, the dramatic final horserace in "Day" makes for a much more satisfying conclusion than the lovers' duet in "Night". Head for the races before you see the opera.
One of the greatest comedies of all time, A Night at the Opera is one of those films that just doesn't get stale. It's a movie that perfectly follows the Marx Brothers' recipe for their trademark mayhem: take a pompus, uptight institution--such as academia, medicine or politics--and trash it. In this case, it's the wild and wacky world of opera.<br /><br />When opera singers Riccardo and Rosa are separated by the wicked Lassparri, it's up to Otis B. Driftwood, Fiorello and Tomasso to get them back together again, and help them become stars of the New York Opera Company. They do this by shredding a contract, stuffing fifteen people into a stateroom, shuffling beds around a hotel room, stealing the beards of three aviators, and turning an orchestra pit into a baseball diamond--among other inspired acts of lunacy. Does any of that really help? Maybe a little bit. But all you'll care about is that it's fun to watch!<br /><br />There's a reason that, after seventy years, this film is still as popular as it is. All it takes is one screening to figure out what it is. Grab yourself some hard-boiled eggs and enjoy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
A Night at the Opera was the first Marx Bros. movie for MGM after leaving Paramount and its one of their best.  Certainly a top 3 with Animal Crackers and Duck Soup.<br /><br />Groucho Marx (Otis Driftwood)tries to make a quick buck when he hears that a young tenor can be brought up for a extraordinary price. So him and his crazy friends Chico and Harpo tries to persuade the manager of the opera company to sign up a young talent. However this young talent is also so deeply in love with one of the operatic shows.<br /><br />The film features two of their best bits:  The overcrowded stateroom, and Groucho explaining the Opera Contract to Chico and talking about the "Sanity Clause" prompting Chico to respond, "Aww go on there ain't no Sanity Claus!"  Classic.<br /><br />Groucho's one liners are probably the best comic lines on film, and Harpo's silent antics are a delight, while Chico is up to his same old tricks. The three work brilliantly while director Sam Wood and the writers work in some good musical acts and classic comedy bits.<br /><br />Of course the ever put-upon Margaret Dumont is back for more abuse from Groucho as Mrs. Claypool.  Wonderful stuff!
&quot;A Night at the Opera,&quot; the first movie the Marx Brothers made for MGM, is one of their best. Yes, it is more conventional that their earlier films, and the love story (while not as offensively bad as some make it out to be) is forgettable. Still, the comic moments (including the famous stateroom scene) remain very funny, and there are numerous one-liners (especially from Groucho).<br />The DVD, part of Warner Brothers' &quot;Marx Brothers Collection,&quot; is pretty good. The image is in its original 1.33:1 full-frame aspect ratio, and is relatively clear. The commentary by Leonard Maltin, while having a few gaps and providing little information on the Marx Brothers' earlier years, is fine. There is an entertaining (although somewhat unbeiievable) story from Groucho on a mid-sixites talk show. Also included are a trailer and (in an interesting move) some old shorts and cartoons from around the time this film was made.<br />The only real fault of the disc is in its thirty minute documentary, &quot;Remarks on Marx.&quot; Most of the interviewees have little of interest to say (especially the always affordable Dom DeLuise, who actually tries to be funny), and the analysis of several classic scenes (especially the stateroom) is obvious at best and boring at worst. An interesting interview with romantic lead Kitty Carlisle is the saving grace.
Otis B. Driftwood:  You didn't happen to see my suit in there, did you?<br />Fiorello:  Yeah, it was taking up too much room, so we sold it.<br />Otis B. Driftwood:  Didja get anything for it?<br />Fiorello:  A dollar forty.<br />Otis B. Driftwood:  That's my suit alright. <p>Sam Wood's "A Night at the Opera" is a film filled with the typical Marx Brothers fun.  No comedy group has proven so adept at squeezing out laughs from any situation.  The chaotic energy produced by the Brothers truly is something to behold as no circumstance can escape unscathed from their manic, yet wildly entertaining, comedic destructiveness.  <p>Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) is a fast-talking manager who tells Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) that he can get her into high society if she agrees to invest her money in the New York Opera Company.  The head of the opera company, Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman) wants to use her money to hire Italian sensation Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) but Tomasso (Harpo Marx) and Fiorello (Chico Marx) want to steal the spotlight for their friend Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones), an up-and-coming tenor waiting for his big break.  Also figuring into the mix is Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle), the beautiful soprano who is in love with Ricardo but who is also being pursued by Rodolfo.<p>"A Night at the Opera" is actually a sweet love story at its core.  The destined pairing of Ricardo and Rosa is the one element of the story that keeps the film moving forward.  So engaging is the couple that you're cheering for them from the start.  However, Groucho, Harpo, and Chico together make up a comedic force that just will not be ignored.  They do their very best to steal your attention away from the young lovers and they succeed as usual.  Whether it is Otis crowding everyone from the bellhop to the manicurist into his stateroom or the diabolical plan of the trio to make the opening night audience despise Rodolfo, you cannot help but smile at The Marx Brothers' exploits.  The supporting actors are also in fine form as Dumont, King, Jones, and Carlisle maintain enough screen presence to keep from being overshadowed - no small feat when you consider who their co-stars are.  Take a look at "A Night at the Opera" and brace yourself for the most fun you will ever have at the opera.
This was the first VHS movie I ever bought, back in 1981. I still watch it and it still makes me laugh. It's one of the greatest comedies of all time.
An incredibly funny film, Groucho and the gang are really at their best here along with their old foil Margaret Dumont. One of the best sight gags of all time occurs when Mrs. Claypoole opens the door to Groucho's room  aboard ship, really has to be seen to be appreciated.
This movie really amazed me.  It showed me how funny movies could be, even 70 years ago.  In fact, I can't remember a movie this funny being shown in any theater in recent times.  There probably hasn't been something this funny in theaters for at least six years.<br /><br />Groucho is top notch in this one.  Although he's known for making joke after joke after joke in a very short amount of time, he puts tons of top quality jokes into his performance here.  After publicly thanking Mrs. Claypool for financing the opera, he tells the audience that he's sure the memories of a great performer will come back to them, just as sure as Mrs. Claypool's checks will come back in the morning.<br /><br />Chico has a great scene in this film too.  He tells a phoney story about flying across the Atlantic.  He says that after two attempts, the plane ran out of gas, and on the third attempt, his crew got about halfway across the ocean and then realized they forgot the airplane.<br /><br />The Marx Brothers somehow manage to get the opera's orchestra to play "Take Me Out To The Ball Game" which forces them to succumb to the irresistable temptation of yelling out "Peanuts, Popcorn."  They ruin the opera in several other ways as well, like dropping random backgrounds behind the actors while they are singing, with Harpo tearing up one of backgrounds too.<br /><br />One of the best scenes is when they stow away in a boat, and end up in a very small room.  As if it weren't cramped enough, visitor after visitor arrives, and soon 20 more people shove their way in there.  It gets so crowded a sleeping Harpo is pushed onto a woman, and while he's lying on her, Groucho says to Chico something along the lines of, "Hey, when I said work fast, I didn't mean your friend, I meant the maid."<br /><br />Groucho's deadbeat-type character never gets old.  He tries to give his hotel bill away, and he withdraws a healthy salary without doing anything.  When he's fired, he demands he gets his two-weeks salary pay.  When informed that he's overdrawn his salary for the next six months, he says he'll take one week's salary instead.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  This movie will get you to really appreciate the genious of the Marx Brothers.
The Marx Brothers have done their absolute best in this picture. I couldn't stop laughing! A couple of scenes I like is when Groucho is ordering food from the steward and he's telling him what to order, and  Chico is inside Groucho's room which is a porthole: &quot;..and two  hard-boiled eggs.&quot; Harpo sounds his bicycle horn making a deep honking  sound. &quot;Make that three hard-boiled eggs.&quot; Groucho replies. A  couple of scenes were boring, especially the ones with the opera singers. I  also like it when the director of the opera company and the police go after  the Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and an opera singer. Harpo is behind the curtain  swinging around on the ropes trying to get away from the police only to  make a real mess out of it. This movie will absolutely satisfy you with  laughs from one of the greatest comedy teams ever!
There were NO songs by Queen on this DVD and I watched it twice.  It was pretty funny.  I started partying.
