'The World's Greatest Formula One Cars' is a great DVD.  It is about all of the best Grand Prix cars that have ever raced in Formula One, cars like Ferrari, Cooper, Lotus, McLaren, Brabham, BRM, Williams and many others.  There is a lot of information on cars that even raced before F1 including the 1930's battles between Mercedes Benz and Auto Union. The DVD starts with the Grand Prix Car from 1920 and continues right up through the years until it reaches Michael Schumacher's Ferrari F2000. There is a lot of great footage on the DVD including the famous battle between Gilles Villeneuve and Rene Arnoux for second place in the 1979 French Grand Prix.  This is a great DVD and any fan of Formula One should buy it.
I think this is a very well put together history of F1, with some content that overlaps other DVDs I have but this title seems much more complete.  However, in this video you will spend a lot of time looking at parked cars while listening to a narrative of their accomplishments, leaving a bit to be desired as far as seeing them in action on track from the cockpit or the tv cameras.  The extra features include some text describing interesting incidents of various champion drivers - this is again the kind of material I would have preferred to see, not read about.
I am a F-1 Car collector as well as Racer. I have been looking for comrehensive F1 history cars in DVD format for a long time. This, is no doubt the best DVDs on F1 cars there is along with book Formula1 1950-today is MUST for any amature F1 fan to professionals. See you in France~!!!!
