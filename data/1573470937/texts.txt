Don't buy this movie thinking that it will be some real thriller with a lot of blood and guts.  It was released by Pulsepounders, a Canadian film company which produces family film horror.  <p>Thouroughly entrenched in the PG range, this is more Goosebumps than Scream and that's a good thing for parents with kids into the horror genre.<p>A teenage boy uses his wits and the support of his family to save his town from a coven of Vampires.  The special effects aren't great, the costumes aren't either, but it serves its purpose of edge-of-the-seat, while at the same time still safe, entertainment a parent can safely let their child watch without worrying it will warp them.
