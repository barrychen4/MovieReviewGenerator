To quote from the War Blade book, "The best way to defeat a knife attacker is to first become a skilled knife fighter." I couldn't agree with that statement more, and I firmly believe that anyone else who agrees with it can do no better than the War Blade program. Sammy's concise, logical and realistic approach completely does away with any notion of the glorified fencing that you see in movies that has no basis in reality. Though I hope I never find myself in a knife fight, if I am ever assaulted with a knife I'm confident that the skills I learned and continue to learn from this program will increase my chances of getting out alive dramatically.
I'm a big fan of the Contemporary Fighting Arts DVDs.  "War Blade," covers all the basics of tactical knife fighting with additional information and drills for both advanced and beginner knife fighters. Mr. Franco covers (among other things) the ranges of knife combat, knife grips, knife fighting stances, and knife defense.  He clearly explains the reasoning behind each technique.  I do not have much experience with knife fighting.  After watching this DVD and practicing the drills, I feel much more confident with my knife fighting skills.  I highly recommend this video to knife owners or anyone thinking of purchasing a knife.
