This is 5 stars if you are a true race fan. Otherwise, it's still an interesting story. This film is loosely based on Tom Wolfe's essay about the younger days of Junior Johnson, although for some reason they changed his name for the film. (Notice, though, that Junior himself was a paid racing consultant on the film.) The race footage is very well done and there is some good footage from the old Southern 500. Bridges and Busey are a lot of fun to watch together as well.If you like stock car racing and wonder what the old days were like when the sport was still developing, you'll love this film. Only pity is it's not on DVD. <p>(Also another great film (although a little cheesy) about the old days is 43 The Petty Story starring Darren McGavin as Lee Petty and Richard Petty as himself AND Dale Inman AND Buddy Baker!!! It is a classic look at the old values that are still carried forward in the sport to some degree. It also has some insight to what NASCAR was and what it has become..Some really good vinatge racing footage is also included.) Also a pity it's not on DVD...We need to prolong the life of these smaller "special interest" films. Anyway have fun, great summmer stuff.
I absolutely loved this movie!  If you have an interest in real life drama, getting over obstacles and above all RACING, then this movie is for you!  It shows the everyday struggle one goes through in their personal  life, as well as one's pursuit towards a dream.  This inspirational story  shows you the everyday obstacles someone in this sport may go through and  increases your interest and excitement with the sport as it is in today's  world.  I recommend this to everyone who lives and breathe NASCAR and other  forms of racing.
This is a very well-written film with strong performances by an excellent cast. If you are a racing fan, you will like the film all the more. The race track scenes have a very authentic feel to them and were clearly shot at real tracks with real crowds. It takes me back to my teen years when I spent a lot of time at race tracks. I love the big, bouffant hairdos of the ladies. You can almost smell the hairspray, racing fuel, and rubber! Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy this DVD!
This movie tells the story of a mountain boy who goes from runnin' moonshine to entering local demolition derbies and dirt races to earn money for his family.  Eventually, our Hero, Elroy Jackson Jr. makes it to the heights of the sport, although that is not covered in the movie.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors of all time, and I was elated when this movie finally became available on DVD.  Great story, great cast, great theme song ("I Got A Name" performed by Jim Croce).
Probably the best racing movie I have seen. Most of them start to bore me when they get to soapy with the love stories, but that isn't the case here. We watch one family that are moonshiners go through the father being arrested and the two sons trying to pay the bills and keep the farm running for the year he is away. Junior Johnson is an excellent driver and ends up racing cars at the track to keep the family afloat. Good acting by Jeff Bridges, Gary Busey, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, and the rest the cast. Fine directing by Lamont Johnson and good story and consulting by Tom Wolfe. Worth at least a rental, but if you enjoy NASCAR movies this probably should be added to your library. If you enjoyed this catch "Six Pack".<br /><br />CA Luster
I have not read the Tom Wolfe essay this story is apparently based on, but as a film it works quite well.  Jeff Bridges, looking like a rougher member of the Beach Boys, is effective as a young guy from a small-town moonshining family, who decided he's going to take the world by storm as a champion driver.  Great supporting cast includes Ned Beatty, Gary Busey, and Valerie Perrine.  Kind of a cross between Monte Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop and Rebel Without a Cause.  And understand that you don't have to be a NASCAR enthusiast to enjoy the film - it's just a great drama.
I saw this movie a few times when it came out back in the day. Like being reunited with an old friend, with some extra cheesiness from a low budget movie such as this. Regardless, that is part of the charm. Great racing footage and you won't go wrong investing seversl bucks in this 70's stock car classic.<br /><br />Go fast.... Turn left!
Recently got tagged pretty hard with a slew of unhelpfuls when I lodged my entry to the Steve McQueen film '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6JG7Q">Le Mans</a>'. Apparently having hit a nerve, aka The Emperor Has No Clothes Penalty, by zealous fans who don't appreciate pointing out the contrived and rather poor construction of the movie.<br /><br />Included in my reply to those who protested or neg'd the review, I noted this film as a benchmark for car racing movies. And having done so, I should step up to the plate and execute one that supports my position. It's important to note that I'm not actually a race fan per se. As a cinephile I review movies, not necessarily the topics which are being presented. A good film is a good film irrespective of whether it's about racing cars or watching snow melt. Bottom line: Can the artists craft a compelling and interesting product?<br /><br />'Hero' tells the true, but fictionally updated, story of Junior Johnson - one of the first stars that helped form the entertainment juggernaut that is today known as NASCAR.<br /><br />Based on a series of fascinating in-depth articles written by Tom Wolfe of '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T6N">Right Stuff</a>' fame, the film opens with a bootlegger and his two young sons. The older of whom displays an exceptional skill at driving, learned while avoiding liquor enforcement authorities. As we're introduced to the character, first impressions are that he's callous, unrepentant and supremely arrogant. Conversely, he's also an obedient and good son whose only goal in life is to support his family. A complex individual who shares both repellant and admirable traits, reflecting a cinematically creative depiction and therefore a more honest portrayal.<br /><br />Junior's skills is only exceeded by his mule-headed desire to never lose under any circumstance. By caroming like a bat out of hell through the backroads of Appalachia, he's earned a reputation for being impossible to catch. Even though well-earned, it's reputation he takes an inordinate amount of pride in - and one that his humble father dislikes and fears. Prophetically, his son's recklessness and brash behavior eventually comes at a very high price. Having pissed off or on just about every officer in several counties, the frustrated and angry authorities instead target his moonshining dad, making him pay for Junior's excesses.<br /><br />With the loss of their primary bread winner, it's now up to the boys, and Junior specifically, to help the family farm survive. But not being half the 'shine producer of his dad, turns to the one thing he does best. This despite an offer to work as a general mechanic; steady employment that would provide stability for himself and his languishing mother and little brother.<br /><br />Deeply conflicted about which fork in the road to take, reaches out to his father in prison. As they get past pleasantries, talk quietly moves to life choices. His dad reveals a core belief with great hesitation, given that he's offering advice while sitting behind bars: "Damn foolishness for one, is breath of life for another", in response to why he kept going back to the stills instead of settling down in the lumber yard. Chagrined and fearful, his mother realizes Junior's free spirit refuses to take the safe path.<br /><br />The die is cast.<br /><br />But is Junior as good as he believes? Can he handle the world beyond the dirt roads and pine trees?<br /><br />While there are some weaknesses in the underpinnings of the screenplay, orphaning some plot threads, 'Hero' is an engaging drama; exploring life beyond the track and examining the complexity of one young man's unquenchable desire to always be in victory lane. A solid film that does more than stitch together action scenes with a thin single plot thread. One that delivers much more than a straight biography - the filmmakers delve into the pursuit of self-discovery.<br /><br />Finally, my very deep appreciation to Valerie Perrine's performance playing damaged pass-around party favor Marge. Her sad tormented past explaining her character's low self-esteem is revealed only near the end of the film, adding an unexpected depth I didn't see coming. And as a cinephile, I love it when I'm caught off guard.<br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- Surprisingly, 'Appalachia' includes New York State.<br /><br />- It's not overtly stated in the film, but Junior's younger brother played by Gary Busey is, I believe, autistic. Explaining why everyone expects Junior to do the right thing - settle down and get a steady job, while not expecting the same from Wayne.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- Quick props to a pair of veteran character actors whose skills added to this film's quality by virtue of their performances. William Smith, while mostly known for bit parts as strongman and thugs - is fondly remembered by this cinephile for a scene-stealing performance as a Russian Spetsnaz Counter Insurgency Officer in the classic '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PMFS14">Red Dawn</a>'. And one of my favorite character actors, Ed Lauter, whose roles are spread across several generations, holds a special place in my library as a hilarious FBI Agent in '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JZBP4Q">The Rocketeer</a>'.
Im a sucker for car movies. Jeff bridges is awsome in this true story about a moon shine runner that goes pro in stock car racing.
Real good movie, lots of exciting moments and true happenings if you are really into yhe history of old school stock car racing
Jeff Bridges is a likable actor, and likable in this movie.  I don't think it was a stand out performance, but as I collect DVD's that have car racing, chasing, crashing, and the like .... I needed to add it to my collection, and it was a nice addition.  If you like Jeff Bridges .... and auto racing, car chasing, and auto sports, it's a fun movie.<br /><br />The bonus, was Valerie Perrine.  Not the greatest part for her, but she can always attract me to buy an inexpensive film, with her in it.  She was so hot!  Playboy nude or not .... she while not the greatest actress of all time, in my opinion was one of the most attractive .... and she did an adequate job in this role.<br /><br />Overall, not Jeff Bridges best, but with Valerie Perrine, and lots of cars chasing around .... it is an enjoyable flick.
The movie was entertaining but not great.  If you like old time racing and the beginnings of today's NASCAR, you will probably like this movie.  If your not a race fan, forget it.<br /><br />Good transaction!
Shows a good histoty of the beginnings of stock car racings with great original film clips.
if you enjoy stockcar racing you will enjoy this movie. it has a decent story and unlike other racing movies it actually is accurately described.
Don't expect a long review out of me (I watch only one or two movies a year) but i liked the hell out of this one
this movie is loosly based on Junior Johnson's biography. I loved it since first seeing it in the drive in and am glad to add it to my collection
Being a nascar fan I had pleasure following the career and familiar ways of the "hero"...
great movie, but package is misslabled.  thier full screen is in fact 2.35 aspect ratio.  thier 2.35 is in fact 1.85. its really bad when movie companys cant figure this simple thing out
Had hoped to get a copy of this somewhat classic movie, but it was sent in dvd zone 1 format and zone 2 was not available. However I was not charged for the item.
This depicts how racing careers started years ago, and Jeff Bridges does an awesome job of showing a great motorsports movie.
Not the actual movie I was looking for, but an ok 70s flick. It was a good 'B' flick. Seemed drawn out though.
