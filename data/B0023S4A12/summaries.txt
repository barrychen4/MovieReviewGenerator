Monsters, Virus Outbreaks, and a Girl with an Eyepatch
Not the best adaptation actually. It's lacking.
Does not feel complete
Catchy Virus
great show, bad ending
Good Story But With A Not-So-Good Ending.
Very strong beginning, very poor ending.
Venus versus Virus
Great anime To short
A bit of everything and done pretty well.
