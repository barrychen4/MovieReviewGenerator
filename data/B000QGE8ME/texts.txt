Wow. The other reviewer was right. It's just an imitation of OldBoy. A very bad imitation at that. It's one thing to remake a movie but to copy every single scene is ridiculous. The CGI was bad(the knife in the back. Yup they copied that), the action scenes were bad(they copied the narrow hallway scene but in a wider area);I mean seriously. Who put punching noises in a fight scene. What is the 60s-704? Plus, I heard the director off this movie Is notorious for ripping off other movies and claiming that they're original. I love bollywood movies so I was excited to receive this movie but I am highly disappointed. I had to watch the real OldBoy just to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Don't watch this movie.
Viewers beware, this is just a bad imitation from the original Korean blockbuster - "Old Boy".
