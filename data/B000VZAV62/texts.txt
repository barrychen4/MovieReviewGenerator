VAI's ongoing excavation of Japanese archival broadcast performances from the 1960s and 1970s continues with this relative rarity. One is surprised to encounter, on the heels of the earlier LUCIA and FAUST in the series, an opera for which no competing DVD is in the catalogue, and for which the 1997 "Met Guide To Opera On Video" lists only a single VHS performance, that one a 1952 black-and-white film of an edition so severely cut that it barely exceeded the length of a highlights CD.<br /><br />Donizetti's dramatic opera LA FAVORITE was composed for Paris, as even the uninitiated might guess from the conspicuous Act II ballet, dutifully danced here by local talent. Partly for its novelty value as a showcase for a star mezzo-soprano or contralto (the only soprano role, the heroine's confidante, is decidedly secondary), it has maintained a bare toehold in the repertory. Donizetti's music, as usual (exceptions being his comedic masterpieces ELISIR and DON PASQUALE), alternates between inspired and baldly formulaic, its stronger passages anticipating Verdi. The opera usually is performed, as here, in the ghastly Italian translation LA FAVORITA, which inflicts poorly constructed verses on Donizetti's melodic lines and also rewrites key relationships, for the appeasement of censors of the day. When the Italian translators were done with their work, the basso, originally conceived as a prior at a monastery, was not only a holy man but also a sort of governor figure, as well as the father of two children, the opera's tenor hero and the off-stage queen whom the king is wronging with his affair. The tenor is thus the brother-in-law of his baritonal rival. Much is made of his belief that he must achieve military distinction in order to be worthy of his mysterious lover, whom he believes to be of noble rank (this is the mezzo character, who is also the lover of the king), though in the Italian version this low-born striver is the queen's brother. Marrying well did nothing for the station of this woman's poor family, it seems. A libretto that already poses challenges with its improbable developments, some cluttered intriguing in the middle acts (intercepted letters and the like), and the dated nature of its moral values and dilemmas (even by Italian bel canto standards), becomes ludicrous verging on incomprehensible. The French version, which recently has been well served on an RCA audio recording starring Vesselina Kasarova and Ramon Vargas, is far superior as music and theater. The Italian bastardization can succeed only if supported by great singing.<br /><br />Fortunately, more of the principals here can oblige us than not. Working my way up from lowest to highest voice, Ruggero Raimondi, a lad of 29 at the time and quite the youngest member of this quartet, was just embarking on that stretch of 15 years or so when he was the featured basso in every prestigious production or recording of an Italian opera for which Nicolai Ghiaurov could not be engaged. (I exaggerate. Slightly.) He has been aged convincingly for stage purposes as Baldassarre, and his admirers will find much to enjoy. His vocalism is silken-smooth as usual, with a little more punch and solidity to it than is often the case (he often sounds more juiced on stage than in the studio), and he is becomingly recorded. There is no getting around the weak bottom notes, a career-long debit, but it is a strong showing. The most significant blot on the performance is Sesto Bruscantini's Alfonso. Bruscantini in 1971 already had a few decades of experience behind him, and as late as the mid-1980s he continued to demonstrate his utility in live performances and recordings of comedic roles in COSI FAN TUTTE, DON PASQUALE and LA FORZA DEL DESTINO under no less exacting a conductor than Riccardo Muti. But the qualities that enable one to excel in a buffo part such as Don Pasquale or Fra Melitone are of little help in a bel canto dramatic assignment that demands facility with long lyric lines and some measure of florid dexterity. The Act II sequence "Vieni, amor!...De'nemici tuoi lo sdegno" is, quite simply, calamitous. The baritone struggles with both pitch and balance, and fights a losing battle with a wobble so pronounced that it renders much of the music unintelligible. One winces for Bruscantini, and wants for his sake and one's own for the final bar line to be reached. The polite reception he receives for this entrance is to the great credit of a gracious Tokyo audience. Bruscantini remains a liability in an ensuing duet with the mezzo; thereafter, he effects a partial recovery, but never raises his standing above mediocre. At no point could this unsteady, poorly focused growling and barking be mistaken for good singing, and the preservation of this performance does no credit to a distinguished career.<br /><br />The evaluation is reversed in the case of our Fernando, Alfredo Kraus, who all by himself would justify the purchase of this DVD for the master class in the arts of mezzavoce and legato that he provides in his Act IV solo. Kraus has come down to posterity as a singer prized for the finer points, for stylishness and elegance, and this is as it should be. What often surprises me, although I should not continue to be surprised at this point, is the sheer power that he can summon along with those virtues. He sounds as though he could hold his final high note in this opera -- and a thrilling, ringing thing it is -- for days. His partner, Fiorenza Cossotto, singing the eponymous role, can be seen today as a well-balanced bridging figure in her performing tradition. Her manner is gutsy and temperamental, and she is not above some old-fashioned breaking of character to bask in a triumph. Having just sung an aria that includes such lines as "Heaven itself decreed my grief...At my feet the grave has opened," she throws her arms wide open and beams, ecstatic. Character Leonora is not eagerly anticipating the fulfillment of a morbid death fantasy; singer Fiorenza is just especially pleased with the climactic high notes she has nailed, and with the three-minute ovation she gets for the effort. It would be easy to note such a display and consign Cossotto to the old school without qualification; but in fact, she combines that gusto and abandon with a quite modern respect for musical values. Like Kraus, she can be both forceful *and* graceful, and while her stage acting is only serviceable, she is at a rarefied level in her ability to use her voice's colors, shadings, and dynamics in the service of the text. The power of her acting is always in the musical gesture and nuance, not in the things she does with her hands or her face. On her personal 1-to-10 scale, this performance is about an "8" -- a few tones at the very top come out slightly squeezed, and her high note to close out the noisy Act III ensemble is not quite up to pitch -- but Cossotto at "8" is a tremendous pleasure. She was something of "la favorita" herself for record companies in the 1960s and 1970s, and was able to commit almost all of her signature roles to deluxe commercial recordings in that period. Her later Decca recording of this part, opposite Pavarotti, is note-complete, as this is not (here she sings only one verse of the Act III cabaletta, and is allowed to modify the coda by dropping out for a couple of measures so as to load up for the big money notes at the finish), but in every other respect the live performance is to be preferred. The mezzo's voice has more freshness and sap, with all its distinctive characteristics in evidence: the sweet, sopranoish top; the tangy, piquant middle; the low notes which seem covered in a ruby veil.<br /><br />In reviewing the FAUST DVD in this series, I wrote, "Stage lighting levels were too low to begin with, and this conspires with age-related softness and color fade (and weak black levels) to create a pervasive murkiness. To call the production minimalist would be to credit it with a conceptual dimension it does not have; this is just rudimentary, no-frills staging. Props and decoration are scarce, and there is little evidence of the ordering intelligence of a strong director guiding the singers' movements and gestures, which are well-schooled but stock; the Japanese audience may not have seen them many times before, but you have." All of the above applies here as well, although I am even more critical of this staging. On that level it is a limp, enervated affair, and no one here is as much fun to watch as Scotto and Ghiaurov were in the FAUST. I have ripped an audio copy and will prefer in the future to appreciate the performance's assets that way. I also have to intensify criticism of the picture quality: besides being dim and murky, most of it has a blue-green tint that suggests either an opera taking place in an aquarium, or one watched through Buffalo Bill's night-vision goggles. On the plus side, there are no burned-in Japanese subtitles, as the FAUST had. The sound is excellent (stereo, surprisingly, where the slightly later FAUST had been mono), but one must learn to screen out the persistently audible murmuring of a male prompter.<br /><br />To conclude, a word of praise for the NHK Symphony Orchestra and NHK Italian Opera Chorus. I do not know how much rehearsal time these Japanese musicians were allowed, but I know that their acquaintance with a second-tier Donizetti item such as LA FAVORITA could not have been  long and deep. One would scarcely guess this from the vigor, accuracy, and professionalism of their playing, which frankly puts the work of 75 percent of the provincial Italian and South American orchestras of that era -- even in much better-known music such as LA TRAVIATA -- to shame. They are abetted in the endeavor by the well-schooled conducting of Oliviero de Fabritiis, one of those lifetime Italian pit conductors whose unflashy but stylistically secure work is destined to go underappreciated.
I can't figure out why in the world this opera isn't done on a regular basis.  The Metropolitan has Dolora Zajick on its roster who has sung the title roll in opera houses all over Europe but not the Met.  Let's get a production going for her before she retires to her farm house in Reno.  As fas as this 1971 production goes, I can't tell if it's in color or black and white with a blue tint. Either way, the picture is grainy. the sets are cheap looking and the lighting certainly wansn't done with video in mind.  On the positive side we have the great Fiorenza Cossotto and the great Alfredo Kraus who make this DVD worth the purchase price.  Their scenes together(especially in acts three and four) are vocal dynamite.  For added excitement and great old fashioned Italian singing we have Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi with Olivero de Fabrities in the orchesta pit.  We may get a better production and picture of FAVORITA in the future, but nothing will surpass ths singing on this disc.
This DVD is a "must" for all opera's lovers. I'm grateful to the people who recorded this performance, allowing us to hear and see such wonderful voices of the past. Very moving Fiorenza Cossoto's interpretation of the aria "O mio Fernando" and  Alfred Kraus's "Favorita del re". Also,  the "finale" of the second act is remarkable, when the main voices are mixed with those of the chorus. The image is sometimes a little dark, but that doesn't reduce the pleasure of watching this jewel from the past.<br /><br />S&iacute;lvia Costa.
This performance of "La Favorita" is, as far as I know, the ONLY<br />one available on video.  I gave it 5 stars, despite some obvious<br />flaws already mentioned by other reviewers, because it is a wonderful<br />production of a much overlooked and underrated Donizetti opera.<br /><br />The video is somewhat grainy, but my copy does not have the watery<br />green effect others have mentioned. (Clips of it on You Tube<br />are decidedly GREEN!) I don't know if I got a better DVD or if the<br />color is just better on my machine. I do know this...it doesn't<br />have those annoying burned-in Japanese subtitles evident<br />in so many operas VAI has mined from performances in Japan!<br />The audio, while  not exceptional, is perfectly acceptable.<br /><br />Loved the story and found it easy to follow...although, why the<br />Catholic monk/prior (Baldassare) would have a son and daughter<br />was a bit of a mystery.<br /><br />The best part, of course, was the singing, although I didn't find<br />the acting too shabby either. I think Alfredo Kraus's singing<br />and acting could best be described as "elegant." What a performance;<br />absolute perfection from beginning to end. He sang like a god and<br />moved with the grace of a dancer. He was the quintessential Fernando<br />in this production.<br /><br />As for Fiorenza Cossotto, she was a glamorous and thrilling Leonora;<br />she just nailed the role. (Okay, I admit it...I love her.) Yes, she<br />did break character in Act III after hitting her high note in "Scritto<br />e in cielo mio dolor!" But, she did get a thunderous 3 minute ovation<br />from the audience and, being Fiorenza, she just couldn't resist basking<br />in the glory! Well, she did try...a little.  Personally, I loved the moment,<br />but I've already admitted my bias and I don't expect others to agree.<br /><br />Ruggero Raimondi was a majestic Baldassarre, convincingly aged<br />for the role as I think he was fairly young in this production.<br />An exceptional performance, beautifully sung and acted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was not one of Sesto Bruscantini's best<br />performances. As King Alfonso, he was on pretty shaky ground until<br />he got his footing toward the middle of the opera. He's a<br />pretty impressive baritone, so perhaps he was ailing<br />or just having an off-night.<br /><br />This performance, warts and all, is well worth purchasing and I<br />highly recommend it. If you've never seen "La Favorita," this may<br />be your only opportunity.
I agree that the cast in this wonderful performance wasn't that even.<br />However, that unevenness does not really subtract fromt he stupendous performances by Cossotto in the title role 'La favorita' and Kraus in the tenor role of Ferrando.<br />Of the two major supporting roles, Ruggero Raimondi is an adequate friar, if not outstanding. However, Bruscantini as the King really throws much downhill 'relief' to the otherwise sky high level of performance.<br />Put it this way - this performance is an out and out showcase of what 'bel canto' singing is about. Alfredo Kraus proved to be the best exponent of this genre in the mid to late 20th century, and the first decade of the 21st as well. He has more elegance and style than Pavarotti, if not the same prowess. His phrasing and messa di voce really put Pav to shame, if you allow me to say so. And he had a much more pleasing timbre than Juan Diego Florez, and far better nuances and characterisation to boot. In his prime, his high notes were done with far greater ease and smoothness than Florez, as his Act Iv aria 'La favorita de re' amply showed (compared with Florez's French version in the 'Bel Canto Spectacular' Album last year).<br />Then, on the other hand, what non-bel canto singers could 'do' with bel canto works is also amply demonstrated by Bruscantini. Sloppy phrasing, missed notes, inaccurate enunciations, all in all resulting in pitch failures and articulation problems so glaring that one simply had to press the 'fast forward' button to skip the torture.<br />Then in the middle of the road, Fiorenza Cossotto the famous Verdian mezzo, who demonstrates here that she 'knew' what is bel canto and how she could make the best out of it, though not an out and out bel canto expert. She has less of a stage presence than Kraus in that she was unfamiliar with portrayals of famous beauties than the Verdian mezzo characters like Azucena.<br />A spectacular performance in many ways. Discounting the hiccups, still heartily recommended for all bel canto lovers and to anyone interested to know what actually is 'bel canto'.<br />You will fall in love with Kraus and Cossotto.
I was a bit put off in the beginning with the poor quality of the DVD, the picture seemed to be grainy.  The theater was very dark and you saw very little of the orchestra or the conductor.  But when the singers 'warmed up' you were impressed with the voices.  Donizetti's music, as always is so melodic you can close your eyes, sit back and soar!  The audience was enthusiastic in their applause, prolonged ovations; Leonora was visibly moved to tears after the ovation for one of her arias.  The cast was excellant, choreography for ballet scene was superb.  I was only slightly disappointed with the set direction and the quality of the filming of the DVD.
Yes, a great performance, the music was beautiful but the quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired, the image was blurry and at times looked washed out and the intrusion of the prompter at times drove me to anger, but in spite of everything I am glad that I saw this performance and added it to my collection.<br />Just the joy of hearing Cossotto, Kraus and Raimondi in their prime is worth the price of this item.<br />Warts and all, I highly recommend it.<br />If you are an opera lover you'll enjoy this rarely performed opera.
I love Kraus and Cossotto.  They are both dynamite singers in this video.  Cossotto is a bit heavily made-up and her acting is a bit plastic, but her singing is wonderful.  Kraus always pleases me with his general class and finesse, even physically.  I am also a big fan of Bruscantini, but I will admit, I didn't think this is the best presentation of his work.  His Italian style is wonderful, but his voice and manner seem a bit gruff for this role.  I have a few recordings of him where he is very good up to even magnificent, but perhaps this particular music is asking too much fluidity for his voice.  Still, he was a thoroughly professional singer and enjoyable enough in this video.  It's really fun to get some of these older, live performances of great singers, many now deceased, and relive their artistry, seeing them, whilst hearing them.  The sound is good in this recording and I play it often.
Sometimes one forgets the great singers of but a few years ago.  This 1971 performance recording, made in Tokyo, though visually a bit dark, is acoustically sparkling with the singers' joy with Donizetti's music.  He  would surely loudly applaud this effort.  Both Fiorenza Cossotto and Alfredo Kraus are at their peak.  To say nothing of Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi in supporting roles.  This opera, unfortunately, is often overlooked for the better known Donizetti works.  Well worth enjoying as the music is grand, the arias are among his finest and the ballet a treat to see.
By far the best recording I have seen of this, one of Donizetti's most famous operas.  Alfredo Kraus sings an especially fine Fernando.
I bought this recently and just watched it.  The picture quality is horrible.  You cannot see anyone in the orchestra since the picture is dark and grainy.  The sound is surprisingly excellent and in stereo.  The orchestra is very good.  The singing is top notch although Bruscantini was far below expectations.  Cossotto was a pleasure and a very young Raimondi who was made up to look very old was terrific.  But what makes this DVD a good buy is the opportunity to hear and see Alfredo Kraus.  One of the top tenors in my lifetime he is at his best in this opera.  Only the graininess and darkness of the picture brings my rating of this down to a three.
La Favorita will never be one of my favorites, but it has its moments...a few anyway.<br />This was a 1971 production in Tokyo.  The dancers and chorus were Japanese, which caused some trouble in choruses such as "A lei son plesso alfine!" which tended to come out as "A ray sor plesso arfeeney."  But nevermind that.  The production as a whole and the opera itself were rather awful...summoning up every opra cliche and staged ineptly.  (I was tempted to go back through the whole thing and list all the blunders, much as I once did for Florence Foster Jenkins, but I decided not to.)<br />So why buy the DVD?  Because I heard the same production on Notre Dame's art-music radio station.  Radio compliments the work as one doesn't have to watch the awful staging and acting and the libretto doesn't matter.  BUT the voices of the principals got my attention.  Four folks in terrific form:  Soprano Florenza Cossotto, whom I had never heard of but who had a lovely, creamy voice.  A relatively young Alfredo Kraus at the peak of his lyric abilities.  In equally fine voice, Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi, who was much later to do a wonderful Figaro in "The Marriage of Same."<br />Some high points worth revisiting.  Alfonso's "De' nemici tuoi lo sdegno" from Act II.  Leonora's "O Mio Fernando" and the flanking tunes, which got Cossotto a LONG ovation.  Fernando's "Spirto gentil, de' sogni miei" from Act IV, maybe the only aria from this opera that shows up from time to time in recitals and anthologies.  The tail of the last act, where Leonora and Fernando exchange loud pleasantries before she drops dead.  Happily, all this stuff on the DVD is numbered so one can dial in what one wishes to reprise without listening to and watching the intervening nonsense.<br />Bo Kerrihard
