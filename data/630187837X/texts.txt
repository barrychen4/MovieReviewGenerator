This movie is what the 1990s action movie on-a-budget, was all about: a low-budget, urban, martial arts/action, western starring the incomparable Steve James.  The story was nice.Great one-liners.. The acting was pretty good, too.  Reb Brown is so over-the-top-- it's perfect!! Wall -to-wall fisticuffs.*The final fight scene against the multiple assailants in the warehouse seems to go on forever( Tony Jaa,'The Protector', would love it!!)--and I was so pumped,after it was over, I wanted to go fight 63 guys too--!! This movie is a classic, and should be released on DVD with all the extras.  This would a fitting tribute to the great Steve James.
