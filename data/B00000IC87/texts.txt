I recently found this two-pack in a bargain bin for five bucks, Being a Lucy fan I snatched it up and brought it home. Well all I can say is that I'm glad I only paid five bucks for it. On the up side the shows are highly entertaining and they highlight an era in television that rarely receives it's due, But on the down side the tranfer looks like it's been pooped on and at times all you see is a white screen with an outline of Lucy. But the shows almost make this DVD a good value, bottom line! BUY IT FOR FIVE BUCKS. Any higher it's a bad value.
Not as good as I Love Lucy these four episodes of her later show don't do Lucy justice. Another thing is the quality. DVD's are supposed to be of high quality but they used a very bad film copy when they made this. It  even jumps in a couple places! I'm taking mine back to the store.
The Lucy show DVD set was cheap. There were no official air dates of each episode, which would be good information for fans, and the episodes were not restored much, and, all of the episodes are out of order...like the first 4 are in color, and then theres one from the first 3 seasons, in black and white...I'd wait for a better edition DVD package unless you're a diehard fan, but, on the record, they picked some fairly good episodes for this 10 episode DVD 2 pack! The shower episode, Lucy takes vacation and new roommate episodes were great!
This 2-disc set from Madacy Entertainment comprises 10 great episodes from THE LUCY SHOW.  This sitcom told the story of widows Lucy Carmichael (Lucille Ball) and Viv Bagley (Vivian Vance) raising their children together in upstate New York.  Later on, the series changed when Lucy traveled to California to be the secretary to grumpy banker Mr Mooney (Gale Gordon).  This set features eps from both phases of the series.<br /><br />"Lucy the Starmaker" - Lucy notices Mr Cheever's nephew (Frankie Avalon) has a great singing voice and decides to help launch his entertainment career.<br /><br />"Lucy Meets Robert Goulet" - When a truck-driver gets turned down for a loan, Lucy notices he resembles Robert Goulet and enters him in a look-alike contest.  This episode also features a young Lucie Arnaz playing one of Lucy's secretary friends.<br /><br />"Lucy Gets a Roommate" - Lucy receives more than she bargained for with her latest flatmate, eccentric librarian Carol Bradford (guest star Carol Burnett).<br /><br />"Lucy and Carol in Palm Springs" - Lucy feigns illness and joins Carol's band for a golfing tournament engagement, unaware that Mr Mooney is one of the entrants.<br /><br />"Lucy's Barbershop Quartet" - Lucy wants to join Viv's barbershop group, but she doesn't make much of an impression with her whisper-soft rendition of `Down By the Old Mill Stream'.  Perhaps an eccentric voice coach (guest star Hans Conreid) can help?<br /><br />"Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower" - Trying to save money, Lucy and Viv attempt to install a shower in the boys' bedroom.<br /><br />"Lucy's Substitute Secretary" - Lucy calls off her Lake Arrowhead vacation when she discovers her efficient replacement (guest star Ruta Lee).<br /><br />"Lucy and the French Movie Star" - Lucy attempts to stave off the advances of the bank's newest celebrity client (guest star Jacques Bergerac).<br /><br />"Main Street USA" - Lucy joins forces with a local town who are fighting against developers wanting to put a freeway through beloved Main Street.<br /><br />"Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard" - Lucy mistakes the bank's newest celebrity client for a bank robber.<br /><br />Pretty good box set for the money.  Extras include a trivia quiz and some classic commercials.
