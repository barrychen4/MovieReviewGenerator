Stylish, hip thriller marred by poor transfer
Worst transfer yet of a great film - Should be recalled
Beats FoxLorber, but only a so-so print.  Why?
A Thrilling Visual Poem
Diva audio disappointing
At the Top
Horror
Best Re-Mastered Version(dvd) of Diva EVER!
Still a brilliantly stylish updating of Hitchcock
Excellent movie -let's hope they redo the DVD
Almost didn't buy it!
Diva - supercool, et tr&egrave;s moderne
Quintessential 80s European film-making - but consider other versions than the new Meridian
Wish I'd listened to the warnings
A classic
