This stylish, hip thriller of the early 80's is a cult classic. Featuring Wilhelmenia Wiggins-Fernandez, a real-life Diva. In the film she plays Cynthia Hawkins, an opera singer who refuses to record her  music.<p>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Andr&eacute;i (Jules) is a loner messenger boy, who makes a  beautiful bootleg recording of one of her recitals. He also becomes the  unknowing recipient of a tape containing evidence about the Paris  underworld, setting off a chain of events where everyone's motives are  misunderstood. <p>Sad to say, this good film is seriously marred by the  worst sound transfer I have ever heard on a DVD. It is muddy and  indistinct, much worse than most VHS tapes. Because the voice of  Wilhelmenia Wiggins-Fernandez is central to the plot, the poor audio  quality makes it hard to understand why anyone would make such a fuss about  recording her. <p>The video transfer is not great, but passable, however  the audio quality seriously dimishes the impact of a good film. If you  listen to the compact disk soundtrack, you'll know what you're missing.  This DVD looks like it was rushed to market with very little thought or  care.  The film deserves a better fate.
The Anchor Bay version from 2001 is currently the best you can do with this title.  I had high hopes for the new release, but was suspicious based on the awful cover art.  Sure enough, they have a super-low bit rate, are actually zooming on the image in some areas and have problems with no English subtitles on some of the extras (the film is in French).  I've shown the Anchor Bay version to friends in the last few years all of whom have been impressed by this clever caper from 1981.  But when a company comes out with a new version (seven years after the last time Diva was released on DVD)  it deserves a whole lot better than this.  I second the call for the director of the film and whoever owns the rights to get it the heck away from Lion's Gate so Criterion or some decent production studio can take a crack at it.  DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION.
Much better sound than the (awful) Fox Lorber version, much better DVD recording quality, and widescreen, too.  HOWEVER, the Fox Lorber guys started with a much better print (they just messed it up); this version (Anchor Bay) used a grainy and somewhat faded print.  A shame for a movie that relies so much on the visuals.  When, oh when can we have a competent DVD recording struck from a high-quality print?<br />Five stars for the movie per se, three for the technical execution of this DVD.
Diva is poetically visual as it displays a cinematically stunning experience, which renders one speechless with its sublime cinematography.  The story begins with a postman, Jules, who is absorbed by opera as he tapes an opera singers performance.  Unknowingly Jules has been observed by two peculiar men followings him in order to try retrieve the recording.  In addition, a woman who is murdered has placed a tape recording in Jules's postman bag, which will add more problems for him.  Diva is a superb cinematic experience that will visually intrigue as much French New Wave did during the 60s and 70s as it often produces new and interesting ways of displaying cinema.
Diva is one of my favorite international movies with spectacular surrealistic cinematography and French-style action mixed with beautiful  bel canto singing.  Unfortunately, the producers of the DVD version of the  movie really didn't know what they were doing on the audio track which is  mono and seems to suffer from severe compression and distortion  effects.  The effect is that the sound track sounds muffled and  occasionally even  drops out altogether. Unfortunately, the  audio quality is so bad that it  really ruins the movie, and  ultimately makes one want to fast-forward  through Wilhelmenia Fern&aacute;ndez's beautiful singing. What a  shame.<p>Therefore, although I highly recommend the movie, I would  definitely NOT recommend this DVD.  Perhaps the video version or  French-only release is better.
Diva is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I have been looking to replace my very old and very worn VHS version with a DVD, but alas, it seems that the quality is not up to par for this excellent film.  I still  remember the first time that I saw it.  I was transformed.  I have seen it  probably about 25 times and it never loses its impact, its freshness, its  greatness.<p>I hope that another version is released soon.  I plan on  having some type of version for the rest of my life.
This DVD is an insult to DVD technology. I have never heard such a bad sound, not even on video tapes. The movies worth is at least 50% sound (who ever saw it). Besides the fact that laguage is french (what I oversaw) this  es my worst DVD experience ever. 1 star is too much.
O.K.<br /><br />Lets cut straight to the chase and make it short and sweet.<br />First most important thing - I don't understand the negative reviews of the "Meridian Collection by Lionsgate" version of Diva, I really don't. Maybe these people have something wrong with their TV/Video settings? I watched this on my new flat screen LCD TV connected to the stereo and experienced absolutely no problems.<br />This is one of the best French films of all time. It is a completely unique piece of cinema. If you like quirky movies that have romance, comedy, suspense, intrigue, drama, cute boys, beautiful women, eccentric artists, corrupt police, angelic singing, amazing cinematography, excellent soundtracks, accordian loving hitmen and not to mention the X-factor..........then this is your movie!<br />It is the classic of classics. It is very French.<br />When I was a "green" 19 year old in 1987, a mature age student(female) at college recommended this movie to me. She said: "just go and watch this movie by yourself - you will love it". I'm so glad I had faith in my friend that day, because "Diva" changed my life. It opened me up to a much more colourful, beautiful and eccentric world.<br />I had put off getting my own copy of "Diva" on DVD for some time, because many reviews were saying that the companies who had transferred Diva to DVD had done a very poor job. I waited ever so patiently. Then my heart fired up and gave me the signal to give the "Meridian Collection" by Lionsgate a go. It does not dissappoint. This remastering of Diva is perfect. Image quality can't be faulted. Soundtrack is crisp and clean. Lovely extra features where they interview the lead actor and director in present time today.<br />So. Go and do yourself a favour - get Diva! Would make a lovely gift for a cinema buff.<br />Hope this was helpful.<br />Peace be with you.<br />Dex.
Jean-Jacques Beineix's ultra-stylish adaptation of Delacorta's hip crime novel DIVA remains nearly as exciting twenty years later as it was when it came out.  A bit of the sheen has come off simply because it was so stylish in terms of the moment it was made.  Nonetheless, so many things in it stand out as brilliantly today as when it came out.  The main chase scene with the protagonist fleeing the bad guys on his scooter remains as exciting today as ever.  The movie is a blend of timeless and topical elements, and the latter have aged gracefully, while the former can hardly age at all.<p>The film is based loosely on a novel by Delacorta, who wrote a series of books centering on the adventures of Serge and Alba, the former being an exceptionally vague sort of crime solver, and the latter a beautiful and exceptionally young female companion.  The movie pushes the two lead characters of the novel and makes them secondary to the plot, and takes the blonde young girl and makes her Asian.  Beineix is less concerned with their story than with that of Jules, a young man who has made a surreptitious, high quality recording of a African American opera singer who refuses to be recorded for mass distribution.  The plot revolves around his accidentally and unknowingly becoming involved (a la Hitchcock) with criminals, and being simultaneously being chased by them and by others who want his recording.<p>When DIVA came out, it seemed to be heralding the arrival of a major new directorial talent in Jean-Jacques Beineix.  He followed DIVA with the beautiful to look at but overall quite disappointing THE MOON IN THE GUTTER.  His subsequent output has also failed to fulfill the promise that DIVA seemed to announce.  Be this as it may, it hardly undermines the brilliance of his debut effort.  It remains one of the great thrillers of the past two decades, and as exciting today as ever.
I was about to buy the DVD since I found it in a store near home. I am glad I read the reviews and hope that the poor sound gets fixed for the DVD... and that the poor reviews get deleted (the ones about sound quality, that is). This is one of my favorite movies and I'd really like to have a copy. I wish there were far more foreign films in this site. There's a whole world out there that people do not understand because there is too much of the same around...
After reading the reviews of the Lionsgate issue of Diva, I almost didn't buy the DVD.  I looked at the price of other issues, and decided on Lionsgate because it was less expensive, offered extra features, and I knew I could return it if the quality turned out to be poor.<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought this.  The picture had very minor graininess which was not distracting.  The thing was made in 1981!  The sound is good.  The subtitles are clear and easy to follow.  The features are wonderful for any film buff, with interviews with the director, other people involved in the production, as well as a few cast members.  There is also scene specific commentary by director, Jean-Jacques Beineix.  All interviews and commentary have English translations.<br /><br />The story has been summarized by other reviewers.  I did not see in the other reviews any note of the link with the real-life diva, Jessye Norman.  Shirley Verrett stated in her autobiography that the story, Diva,  was inspired by a very dedicated fan of Norman's.  Norman said in an interview that this French fan--now deceased--was a messenger by trade.  He traveled all over Europe to attend Norman's performances.  She knew him, speaks of him by name (Alain), and was fond of him--though there was no close friendship.  That's where the resemblance between him and Diva's protagonist, Jules, ends.
Just got the DVD of this classic cult film that I had not seen for at least 15 years.<br /><br />Strangely enough it does not seem to have dated much at all.<br /><br />Tough to describe this film, but it is one of my all time favourites. Sometimes less is more, and Diva is low on plot, high on style and atmosphere (think Blade Runner style in 1980s Paris)<br /><br />As for the sound transfer, not awesome, but the opening aria was still capable of stirring the emotions on my home theater (although if you hear a Maria Callas recording of the same, it is quite mindblowing).<br /><br />Unlike many "cool" French films of the 80s and 90s, Diva goes strong from beginning to end.<br /><br />Once you've seen Diva, buy Subway... one of the all time great opening scenes / car chases... but can't sustain that pace. Great opening chase though, with background music from Propaganda... and I defy anyone to put Propaganda in the car CD player and NOT get a speeding ticket :)
In the same way 'The Breakfast Club' defined a certain kind of 1980s<br />American filmmaking, and 'Blow Up' defined 1960s hipness, 'Diva'<br />defined a certain kind of 1980s European cinema.<br /><br />That doesn't mean it's great, just seminal. It marked a turning away<br />from deep psychology, philosophy, politics or even plot, and marked an<br />emphasis on style, energy, colors, etc. The movie is about being a cool<br />movie, with cool sets, cool shots, a cool car chase, etc. The plot is<br />just enough to hold it all together.<br /><br />All that said, it is great to look at, the chase is fun, and the film<br />is fun too, in an empty calorie, music video sort of way. It's<br />frustrating. If the acting was a little better (the leads range from<br />pretty good to very awkward) and the story had a little more heart and<br />brains, it could have kept it's grand style, and been a great film, not<br />just an entertaining, great looking film.<br /><br />The new Meridian version is disappointingly weak.  I actually<br />prefer my old Anchor Bay copy, which was itself far from<br />perfect, but seems to be stronger both visually and aurally.<br />Read the in depth analysis on DVD Beaver comparing the<br />Meridian, the Anchor Bay and the Fox Lorber and you'll<br />get some interesting details on the differences.<br /><br />I have also heard (but not yet personally seen) that<br />the 2004 region 2 WB and similar 2007 Region 2 Optimum<br />release may actually be the best version around, and currently<br />sells on Amazon UK for about $12 with shipping, so if you have<br />a region free player, you might want to check that out.
Horrid sound that gets worse as the movie progresses.  I'd read the customer comments and bought it anyway.  The sound is so bad at the end of the film that I had to turn the volume up to 9/10ths to hear anything at all.  Instead of enjoying the film I was constantly reaching for the volume control.  By far this is the worst transfer of a film to DVD that I've seen/heard.  If you're thinking of buying, think again or go get a video copy.
Most films are produced by professional production houses and have elements of the formulaic. They are action thrillers, romances, horrors or mysteries. Production companies will use teams of writers a bank of directors and hire actors who have some star quality. Some films from production houses are good, most are mediocre and some are bombs. However most tend to be reasonably simple in construction and use the same tools of audience manipulation.<p>Diva is a film that is different from the main stream. It is in reality simply a mystery thriller with a well-written comic plot. From that point of view it can not be said to be an intellectual film it is very much a main stream production. However whilst not an intellectual film it is a intelligent film. <p>The plot is multi dimensional. A courier secretly tapes the performance of a reclusive opera star. The opera star has never allowed her work to be copied so that the tape is immensely valuable. At the same time a dying woman puts into the couriers bag a tape which holds the clue to a major corruption scandal. The film is about the pursuit of the courier by two lots of villains, one chasing the recording the others chasing the tape. <p>Introduced into the mix is the character of a detective figure who is unlike the conventional action hero as one can be. A character who is obsessed with a Zen like philosophy, who lives in a huge bar apartment and does incredibly complex jigsaw puzzles and who makes strange speeches on the art of buttering the baguette. <p>Rather than the film being powered by a simple plot each scene is carefully crafted both to develop the narrative of the film and also to illustrate the feel of the film and to define the characters. The opening scene is a glorious aria from the rather obscure opera La Wally. The aria is one of subtle beauty and gravity and it is sung by the Diva of the title who is a woman of incredible attractiveness. <p>The key of course is that the film is entertaining and keeps one interested, as it does not use the normal formulas and resolutions of conventional mysteries. It is rather an entry into a slightly strange surreal world. Although France makes its share of dud films, films like this give it the reputation of a country which makes films which are more enjoyable than those released by the mainstream.
Beware!  There is an existing DVD copy of &quot;Diva&quot; out there which was released in the late 1990s.  Although the film is great fun, the DVD fails at the most critical part: the sound quality is miserable.  If this DVD is a newly-minted release of &quot;Diva&quot;, then never mind my complaints, enjoy this excellent film.  If it is just a re-release of the original DVD, then save your time and money.

A wonderful combination of many genres - Action / Drama / Mystery / Romance / Thriller / Music/Art, this tale of two tapes may actually change the way you think about opera.<br /><br />Wilhelmenia Fernandez as Cynthia Hawkins (Diva) who always refused to be recorded - is a revelation; her voice, a magic mixture of melted pure gold and crystal is a miracle.<br /><br />There are so much more in this absolutely unique film - just to mention a certain shoplifting technique, or the coolest chase which started in the streets of Paris and ended in the subway's car.<br /><br />The most fascinating thing for me is that Diva was released about twenty years ago in Moscow, I remember the title - but I never saw it back then. Better later than never.<br /><br />Highly recommended - 4.5/5
A brilliant film, you really should get a copy, but DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! The video is muddy, it reminds me of the Asian Bootlegs shot in theaters by people with cameras hidden in their coats - ironic no?  The sound is beyond description, distorted, muted, flat , just aweful.  Don't waste you time here, move on to one of the higly rated more recent transfers!
The remastered version is wonderful. It allows a really great film to be appreciated properly. The french is easy to follow and some of te film is in English. THe subtitles are well done and accurate.
Even if you don't like French or foreign films, you will enjoy this gem.  This film still stands the test of time.  A classic film with a quirky and brilliant story and cast, superb music and great plotting and cinematography. This version is clear, both for sound and visual images.  A must for any DVD collection!
As other have noted, the audio and video on this particular transfer are quite poor, but the entirety of the movie obscures the individual faults on this particular version (I have viewed this movie on multiple transmissions, and this one is the weakest). However, I am so pleased to have this movie again, and the seller was a pleasure to do business with....thank you!
This is a great movie with a nice plot. Best of all is the performance of soprano Wilhelmina Wiggins Fernandez and the music of "La Wally" from Catalani, an opera rarely performed but nevertheless stunningly beautiful. Even if you have never been exposed to opera you will love the music and maybe this will be the beginning of a new journey into the world of opera.
Good to see this great movie was re-transfered.  The first DVD version of this movie missed the artistry of the movie
A slightly dated gem. Edgy and punk before the words were coined. Wilhelmina Fernandes is divine, and the cinematography anticipates trends seen 20 years later.
The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A flashy and fun thriller with a rightly-famous chase scene through the Paris Metro that heralded (for better or for worse) the advent of the Cinema Du Look mini-movement in France that went away from realism and steered Gallic cinema towards the slickness of directors like Luc Besson, Diva is winding and twisting in a good way, always interesting to  look at and follow; though some of the supporting characters remain ambiguous because they're reoccurring characters in the novel the book is based on, there are few other flaws in this unique film.<br /><br />3.5/4
The French just have a way with making really cool noir type films.  I've recently raved `Le Doulos' and have continually praised `Le Samourai'; both 60's films, but even 1981's `Diva' is an extraordinary example of the perfect mood to compliment the intricate story.  Director Jean-Jacques Beineix masterfully weaves an interesting and engaging tale of opera, mobsters and police corruption, all the while maintaining a steady feeling of `coolness', a coolness that pervades each scene.<br /><br />In `Diva', Frederic Andrei plays Jules, a young mail carrier who is obsessed with the beautiful and talented opera singer Cynthia Hawkins.  Truly a diva, Hawkins refuses to record any of her music, only performing live where she can feed off the energy of her audience.  Jules, being a huge fan of hers, sneaks in a recorder to her concert, so that he can listen to her whenever he wishes.  When his recording gets mixed up with a tape made by a witness from an ongoing police case, Jules finds himself being pursued from all ends; by the police, by mobsters and even by Taiwanese bootleggers who want his Hawkins `recording'.<br /><br />The story is really three or four stories interwoven in a way that makes them feel like one story.  You have the story of Jules obsession and subsequent relationship with Cynthia; you have his relationship with Alba and Gorodish, young thieves; you have his pursuit by the aforementioned and then you have the story of the police case and it's relation to Jules.  All four of these sub-plots are handled in such a fluid manner than none ever feels detached from the other.  They all coincide in perfect harmony.<br /><br />The acting is very good from everyone involved.  Frederic Andrei delivers nicely as Jules, capturing his adoration as well as his confusion as he handles all that is happening around him.  I also really liked what Richard Bohringer did with his small role as Gorodish, and I only wish that he had more screen time.  The two standouts here are the two ladies in Jules' life; Wihelmenia Fernandez (who plays Cynthia) and Thuy An Luu (who plays Alba).  Fernandez is stunning and very controlled as the diva herself, commanding each screen and bleeding forth her characters personal agenda.  Luu is also a stunner here, managing to caress each frame with a dominating sensuality and gripping manner.  They are two completely opposite ends of the equation, and together they equal perfected unity.  Someone once told me that the acting in this film plays against realism, that it feels almost fake but on purpose.  I agree.  The film is played out someone like a fantasy, like a surreal dream and so the actors take on that same tone with their performances.  There is a level of human detachment here that is subtle enough not to detract from the film but obvious enough to actually create another layer, another element to the films already engrossing and unique atmosphere.<br /><br />So, in closing, I consider this a definite `must see' film; a stunning and engrossing and beautiful film noir that covers every base perfectly.
I have to admit, the title, "Diva", had me skip over this movie a few times before I decided to watch it.  I had bad visuals of a Celine Dion-type giddly involved in a whodunnit.  Fortunately, this movie is far more than that.  We get a sense from the start that this is a different sort of film.  For example, our main character is a Paris postal employee with a fetish for an opera-style soloist.  As the movie unfolds, we encounter a few other slightly off-beat characters.  At this point, some of us are probably wondering where all this is headed.  Fortunately, there something about the movie at this stage that keeps us watching because thing begin to expand.  The key to "Diva's success is how the expansion of characters and events gradually contracts back into a conclusion that most of us would probably not have envisioned.  I found myself with a great sense of respect for how "Diva" evolved into a very good film.
A truly fascinating film, with a fascinating premise, really stylish production values, an intricate and exciting plot, and fine performances---and it all starts so simply, before quickly becoming thrillingly-complex. Jules, a young mail carrier, is fascinated by a temperamental American opera singer who has never permitted her voice to be recorded. One evening, he sneaks a high-quality recording device into one of her concerts---which catches the attention of a consortium of shady record producers. Unbeknownst to poor Jules, a desperate whistleblower, with important imformation about a web of governmental corruption, has slipped a vital piece of evidence into his carrier bag, so that a second batch of crooks is also after him. He gets the chance to meet his idol in person, and also gets involved with a young shoplifter with the strangest, almost-inert philosopher of a boyfriend...But can his friends rescue him from the nasty folks who are after him? Can he rescue himself?<p>DIVA is really a marvelously-tangled web: friendship and deceit, obsession and honesty, complexity and comedy, violence and artistry, with one of the most best chase scenes in all of cinematic history. This is one of those movies that I love to recommend to people...So much so that I'm now on my third copy, as people don't seem to want to return it...
If you focus entirely on the story, the intertwining plots occasionally cause Diva to drag a bit, particularly when it focuses on the political intrigue. That's the wrong approach to take to this film. <p>Instead, what  you should do is sit back, enjoy the music, the visuals, and the  characters, and let the film happen. Do that, and Diva is captivating.<p>I  was fortunate enough to find a copy on laserdisc last year, just before  most of the places that carry laserdiscs started phasing them out...
DIVA is my favorite French film of all time! It is full of nail-biting intrigue, beautiful scenery, superb music, fabulous acting... have I said enough? The Jardins des Tuilleries will never be the same for you after  seeing it in this film veiled in the early morning Parisian mist- to die  for! Extremely romantique!!!
Feels like pretentious drivel at times but always looks so damned good. This is one of my favorite films of all time. Just make sure you've got a good stereo to capture the music.<br /><br />The zen of buttering bread. A giant jigsaw. Crash helmet on the mannequin. Warehouse living at its finest. Rollerblading asian girl. Moped chase in the metro.<br /><br />Superb.
'Stumbled' upon 'Diva' on Sunday, 03/18/2007.  I can't add to the opinions already expressed.  I'm getting my copy ASAP!  Overall, I found this film different, but excellent.  If you ever catch this film on cable, watch it!  It will surprise you!<br /><br />Five stars for 'Diva!'<br /><br />(05/24/2007)To follow-up with reviewers and potential buyers.  I purchased my DVD new for $18.93/US from a third-party on Amazon.  Now parties are asking $40+/US?  It appears that in this case, timing really is EVERYTHING when it comes to the 'Diva' DVD!  I guess I just got lucky - still, 'Diva' is an excellent movie - just wait and see if the price goes down below $20/US (if you can!), then make your buy!
awesome!  so many twists and turns and SURPRISES.  do not hesitate to watch this.  it really is as good as it gets.
A moped-riding postman gets caught between a crime boss, his thugs, record pirates and an opera diva. This stylish thriller became one of my favorites when I first saw it in 1981. It lost a little of its appeal with successive viewings as I realized how many opportunities for suspense seem missed. Even the noted subway chase seemed a little leaden. Oh well, my talents aren't in filmmaking. My interest was renewed with the release of the DVD. Though I've read criticism of it here, the clarity of sight and sound made the movie seem refreshing and new. I've rarely seen such a difference in a movie only 20 years old.
This was the first foreign film I'd ever seen (back in the early 80s)and I've never forgotten it; it's a complete masterpiece.  It opened my eyes to foreign cinema and can't get enough of films from other countries.  I gave this product review 3 stars because I love the film, but hearing from others that the sound transfer is horrible, I was completely destroyed!  I really wanted to buy this, but now that I know about the sound and picture quality, I'll wait for something better.  The films sound is SO important to the overall experience!  How could the DVDs distributor not know this?!  Talk about "out to make a buck" and not worry about quality!  Sounds like a job for DTS to take over!
This is one of the very first movies I was ever motivated to buy. A stylish 1981 French art-house classic, "Diva" was considered a failure until it was "discovered" in Seattle, and after a notable run of almost a year, the distributor decided to re-release it. In 1982 it won four C&eacute;sars (French Academy Awards). That time it made its mark: now it has been released again on Amazon.com so I upgraded my cherished VHS tape to a re-mastered DVD.<br /><br />The bone of contention in this thriller is an audio cassette. Problem is, there are TWO of them, each is being sought for its content:<br /><br />*  A bootlegged recording of an American diva, made by an enamored mail courier during a concert which featured an aria from "La Wally" as its centerpiece.<br />*  An expos&eacute; of the police department from a murdered prostitute who had hidden her tape in the messenger's bag on our young hero's parked mobilette.<br /><br />We enjoy unforgettable characters:<br /><br />*  A moped-mounted messenger boy, played by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Andr&eacute;i, who lives alone above an abandoned automotive garage complete with winches, an elevator shaft, mechanic's tools and assorted paraphernalia. He has no idea who is chasing him or why. All he knows is he has a HUGE crush on that lovely opera star.<br />*  An eccentric Diva (she has never allowed her voice to be recorded), played by American Wilhelmina Wiggins, lives in a swanky hotel surrounded by attentive servants, luxurious clothes, delicious food and elegant furnishings.<br />*  An enigmatic character who lives in a huge semi-empty warehouse with a Vietnamese refugee girl who uses roller skates to get around their "house."<br />*  A pair of Taiwanese businessmen who want to duplicate the opera singer's tape and sell it worldwide (there are no copyright agreements between France and Taiwan).<br />*  Two hired thugs who must find and destroy the police department expos&eacute; before corruption is uncovered at the highest levels.<br /><br />During the course of this exciting film, we dash through the Parisian underground, race up narrow alleys, flee across parks, plunge into a pinball arcade (remember, this was made 30 years ago), and end up in a lighthouse.<br /><br />You will hear a gorgeous award-winning soundtrack (Promenade Sentimentale comes to mind), enjoy fleeting glimpses of well-known Parisian landmarks, admire an intricately clever script, and you will come to love both our darling messenger boy and the lovely opera singer.
Diva is one of my Top 10 films - period.  Its place changes in the roster, but in the 15 years since I first saw it, it has NEVER dropped from the list.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Diva has everything.  It has crime - a touch of angsty romance - intrigue - a great soundtrack - plot twists - and two of the most memorable characters ever.  When you watch this film, watch the characters of "Le cure" and "Gorodish".  Le cure is the small thug and Gorodish is the Zen Master of buttering bread.  Gorodish is one of my all time favorite characters on film.<br /><br />The movie is great - but the DVD could use some remastering.  The 2001 DVD is head and shoulders above the earlier release in its sound quality, but I would love to see a remaster of the video also - I don't expect perfection from a film from 1987, but there are moments where I swear I can see the darker areas flicker - and not because they are supposed to!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this and you can handle subtitles - you really should spend a couple of hours and give it a watch.
I just watched this movie again after about 10 years and it's still well worth watching again and again.  It has held up superbly.  I didn't realize it was 26 years old as I remember seeing it when it first came out. I say don't get the english voice overs, see it in french with the subtitles.  It's made to be seen that way, because after all it is a french movie.
I never got to see this film in the theatre but on PBS so I didn't get to experience the full brilliance of the music in stereo.  I'm not an opera fan nor can I speak French but this was the first subtitled film I'd ever seen and enjoyed.<br /><br />This film holds a special place in my heart to this day as one of the more interesting films I've ever seen to date. Everything about it made me want to travel to Paris and live in a loft like "Jules".<br /><br />Although the plot sounds confusing, as you sit there and allow yourself to be transported into these characters' worlds you'll be amazed (as I was) at how easy it is to follow along. This movie features beautiful photography, beautiful music and an exciting storyline - what's not to like? Don't be afraid of the subtitles - it is a really interesting & enjoyable movie.
