This video is awesome. Remy, Juelz Santana, and Ne-Yo perform their hip-hop and R&B hits at The Roseland Ballroom in NYC and tears up the stage. There are also many new talented artists who are interviewed and music videos. I love The Spot Review show! It's like a breath of fresh air. If you are tired of seeing the same faces in the music industry on TV, you need to check out this show.
