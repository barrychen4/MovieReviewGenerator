This of course is an older film but you still get to see Mr. Parker in action in this film.  This is a definite martial arts masterpiece.  If your into Kenpo you need to pick this up and see Mr. Parker doing Kenpo.
These are the Martial Arts Heroes that I grew up with.  To have this<br />film in my private library is a real treat.  Master Han is a class act (as always).  Having studied Kenpo I had hoped to see Master Parker<br />step out of his character (in this film) and give more of a demonstration of his incredible hand speed.  But, all in all... it has a reasonably<br />good plot and was well worth the money.
Too bad there are no ZERO stars.. This "thing" would get it.<br /><br />OK, Parker WAS working for Elvis and so on.<br /><br />But apart from that, which is extremely minor, WHAT is this thing doing under "Elvis Presley" when you search for new Elvis Presley DVD's?<br /><br />Amazon sure had a strange way to put things together.<br /><br />Go ahead try it: Type "Elvis Presley" in DVD search and you'll get a certain number of DVD's... including this.<br /><br />Come on Amazon... wake up!
