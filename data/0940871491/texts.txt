I purchased this tape when I started attending a Yang saber class. The instructor had learned the YMAA saber style by watching this same video so I was assured that the form shown on the tape would be exactly the form that I was going to be learning. Note: care should be taken in "picking" a tape/DVD to use as a training aid -- there are lots of different "family" saber/broadsword form and the differences do not seem to be as well documented as with the the "open hand" T'ai Chi forms.<br /><br />I really wish this production included more audio. You only get to WATCH Dr. Yang and a few senior students run through various exercises and the saber form. There is nothing that could be called "instructional" -- NO audio, NO slo-mo, NO step-by-step. The tape's only audio , other than background music, is a voice reading "chapter headings" in both English and Chinese' There is no matching book.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you're studying the YMAA saber form this is the only game in town. This would NOT be a good choice if you are wanting lo learn a saber form without working with a teacher. The YMAA promises that a DVD version will be available in early 2008.
