Let's clear this from the start: this is not a Hollywood blockbuster. It wasn't meant to be. There are no flashy special effects. No hyper-modern new musical scores. No big-name actors. In fact, a nice touch of this movie  is that real wrestling heroes play the parts. While this does lower the  acting a bit, it also tends to draw any real wrestler deeper into the  movie. In spite of all that (because of it?) almost anyone who loves  wrestling--and even many who don't necessarily love it--will love this  movie. Based on a true story, it portrays the determination and struggles  of two men making a last shot at a chance at the Olympics. Without giving  away the end, I can say that you'll be on the edge of your seat during the  final match, and if you give it chance, you'll walk away from the movie  with a new look at wresting, athletics, and life in general. Highly  recommended!
