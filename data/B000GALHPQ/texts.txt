I don't know a lot about screenwriting but always wanted to try writing a movie, so I got a couple of these Dialogue DVDs.  I watched the Stuart Beattie one first, and I didn't know what to expect.  There's lots of names and lingo, but they do a good job of explaining everything with captions that look like dictionary entries.  I really liked Stuart (maybe it was his Australian accent), and by the time I finished hearing all his stories, I felt like I learned a lot about what it's really like to be a writer in Hollywood.
