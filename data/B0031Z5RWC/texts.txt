There are no logos on the case (like A&E, History Channel, etc) so no one claims to have produced it.  The narrator wasn't identified.  Running time appears to have been overstated.  Low res, low contrast footage that has been seen before.<br /><br />A small note on the back of the case:  "Portions of this DVD have previously been released as BATTLELINE".<br /><br />A waste of money, IMO - I was reluctant to write this review, because I'd be admitting I was dumb enough to buy it (and another one from the same series).  But I feel I need to warn others - maybe they can avoid making the same mistake.
