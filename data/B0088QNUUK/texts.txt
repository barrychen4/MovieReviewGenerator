Such a great film from dedicated and passionate paranormal researchers. I didn't know what to think when I bought this but am so glad I did. It has some of the best evidence of the paranormal out there along with some very intense and scary moments. It's very real and down to earth because these guys and gals didn't do it for some TV channel, they did it to showcase the paranormal to the world and show how haunted the state of Iowa really is. 5 STARS ACROSS THE BOARD!!
