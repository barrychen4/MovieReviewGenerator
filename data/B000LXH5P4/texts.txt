I was extremely disappointed with this DVD and subsequently returned it.  One would hope that an instructional DVD would cover topics such as how to surf cast which is more difficult to learn from a book that can only present a sequence of photographs.  Instead the information covered is actually better presented in Burnley's "Surf Fishing the Atlantic Coast".  Information on how to identify good fishing spots and the equipment to use doesn't require a video format for effective presentation.  The only action in the DVD are scenes of good ol' boys fishing the Carolina Coast--it was more of a travelogue from the fifties than an instructional video.  Save your money.
Most of this is filmed right on the beach with the wind blowing into the mic.  You can't understand about 90% of what they're saying!  Very low quality/amateur. - don't bother.
