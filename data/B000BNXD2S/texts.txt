Of the two home video concert releases I have (the other being "Live At La Luna") this is the better. Recorded in early 87, this is a rare glimpse into what LPD once was and what really got the ball rolling as it pertains to their underground success and following.<br /><br />First and foremost, if you're looking for a big-budget, flashy stage affair, then you must look away from the Legendary Pink Dots' live shows; this show is raw, rather intimate, and mostly there for the people that love their earliest music. It is one camera angle for the whole duration, with a few zooms here and there. While that may sound like a turn off for a DVD you're considering paying X amount of dollars to see, the camera work itself is of a professional level; it all looks good and seldom a shaky angle in this thing, and it hardly ever focuses on one aspect of the band, usually capturing the performance as a whole.<br /><br />Great selections of songs here, too. Plasma Twins really gets things moving, The Hill is an odd little ditty from "Asylum" that rarely gets any love but it is a very good performance, and Echo Police works just fine, to start off this epic set that just gets progressively better and better. So much in fact that it culminates with a completely amazing performance of "I Am The Way, The Truth, The Light" that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />All in all, not for everyone (of course, it's LPD), or even the casual LPD fan. But, if you're already familiar with their music and love the early stuff, this is a must buy.
