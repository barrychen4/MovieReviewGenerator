I just love Michael's bass playing, and to see him in action is an educational experience.  If you've never seen him at one of his "solo bass" performances, then this should catch your interest.  He can keep your interest for two hours playing just his basses....it's amazing!!!<br /><br />In this video, Michael is playing in a jazz quartet studio setting without any prior rehearsal.  The musicians play John Coltrane, Miles Davis, The Police (Sting) and some other tunes.<br /><br />It's an hours worth that is truly enjoyable to watch.... especially for the price too!!!
