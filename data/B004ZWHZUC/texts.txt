This documentary is very interesting and I recommend it. It does a good job of showing the lives of various trans-men. It deals with the struggles they each had to face as parents transitioning from female to male and mommy to daddy.
The movie was interesting.  I wish they would have gone into more detail with the lives of both the parents and the children.  Instead they just move from little clip to little clip weaving back and forth between all of the trans families which made it a little difficult to follow.
