Transfers of ECHO BRIDGE (aka "Platinum Disc") public domain movies is about average. No sign of restoration on their 60 and 70 year old films, with none dubbed from pristine studio prints. Minor downside: on some of their product, this company superimposes a faint intermittent logo on-screen.<br /><br />POY O' GOLD (1941) - James Stewart, Paulette Goddard, Horace Heidt, Charles Winninger, Mary Gordon, Frank Melton (uncredited: Art Carney, Bud Jamison, Nestor Paiva)<br />In a picture loosely adapted from a popular radio program, James Stewart, master of many cinematic genres (including comedy), struggles with the only one he was never comfortable in: the musical. Jimmy performs "When Johnny Toots His Horn" while co-star Paulette Goddard is backed by Horace Heidt's band on "Pete the Piper" and "Broadway Caballero." Stewart also fakes playing the harmonica, but actually took up the instrument as a result of some off-screen tutelage here from Jerry Adler (Larry's brother).<br /><br />MADE FOR EACH OTHER (1939) - Carole Lombard, Jimmy Stewart, Charles Coburn, Lucile Watson, Eddie Quillan (uncredited: Ward Bond, Raymond Bailey)<br />In this David Selznick production, some comedic touches lighten a melodrama about a young couple who have in-law problems and a baby sick with pneumonia. If a serum can't be flown in bad weather from Salt Lake City to New York, their boy will surely die. (Watch for Raymond Bailey, better known as banker Milburn Drysdale on TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JMRR9E">THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES</a>, as the Utah chemist serum-creator.)
Jimmy Stewart playing a harmonica? Maybe in l941 America had its mind on the war and movies, like this one, were very loosely put together. Paulette Goddard plays her usual kinda dingy part. It is interesting to see Horace  Heidt's band again. A young Art Carney is spotted in this not-so-unusual  plot of struggling musicians, love on the fly, rushing here and there to  make the auditions and play dates. You wonder how hunger these actors were  to play in this movie or was it made on furlough for the folks at home.
