This film was the funniest and most surreal thing I have seen in years. When William Wallace is having a dream sequence there is actually a sheep in a purple teddy, a pink boa, and a sheep's mask on. Wallace peels the sheep's mask back to see the sheep underneath. I laughed so hard I start hyperventilating. It helps if you have seen Braveheart since it is a spoof of that film, but it is still funny if you haven't. I really like the fact that it was a spoof that was done respectfully. You could tell that the film makers weren't poking fun at Mel Gibson or making the Braveheart out to be a bad film, they were just having fun with a different perspective of the William Wallace legend. It really reminded me of the Holy Grail. This movie really needs to be seen by everyone. You will either absolutely love, it like I did, or you will hate it.
The theater was packed and everyone was laughing so hard I missed some of the jokes. My face hurt so bad from laughing I almost cried. I can't believe they actually pulled this off. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!!
What a ridiculous riot! This low budget film is very entertaining, clever and funny!! It reminded me of the days of Monte Python and the has the potential to cultivate a following that enjoys audience participation. Sir William Wallace has a crush on sheep and the Kings off spring aren't sure if they are really gay! The old world meets new world slap-stick comedy is sure to get you going. This film is easily one you will want to see more than once! At the premier, all throughout the film, the whole theater was cracking up, cheering and clapping!! I think it helps if you have seen Braveheart or know the story so you can appreciate all the cleverness the film delivers!
Make no mistake that this movie is not a high qaulity movie, but it is outrageous.  If you like Team America, Dude, Where's My Car, Airplane, The Holy Grail, you will totally love this film.  It has like 200 drunken Irish guys who have never acted before that went out and made this movie making fun of Braveheart.  I first saw it in the theater at midnight with 150 other drunken idiots throwing inflatable sheep around and screaming lines at the screen like Rocky Horror Picture Show.  IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.  I bought the DVD and it has tons of outtakes and deleted scenes.  Well worth the money!!!!
Whether you loved or hated Braveheart... who cares. This film is HILARIOUS!!! Raw undiscovered talent and clever, perverse writing carry you through Wallace's self-inquiry into his sexual identity. Need I say more? This is a MUST see! Welcome back to the age of forgotten pure comedy.
To anyone who reads the reviews from Anna Molly and Ian Cross, granted its not the greatest film out there. It was an independent film made locally on a shoestring budget, not some Hollyweird big budget remake. It was simply something that came about as an idea for a short spoof of Braveheart. It was turned into a full length film after some discussion with the financial backer. Personally I think it should have remained a short film, would have been funnier that way.<br /><br />Anyway as to Ian Cross' claims that and I quote "this film is not made by Irish or Scotsmen, but actually consists only of Texans." is entirely false. How do I know? I was in the film as an extra. There were British, Irish, Scottish, Aussie, and New Zealander as well. And yes there were Texans, as that is where it was made. As a side note there was even an extra whose name was Mel Gibson. No kidding, I saw his drivers license. There was even someone who could trace his ancestry directly back to Wallace himself.<br /><br />I will say again, it is not the best film you will ever see, but the spirit in which the film was made I applaud. There needs to be more independent films made, Hollyweird only seems to be able to do remakes these days. Is it worth whats being asked here, maybe not, but if your a fan of indie films you might appreciate it.<br /><br />P.S. The funniest parts are the outtakes. The rugby game was an impromptu thing during down time between filming. Not your usual sport for Texans might I add. I gave it three stars because anything I put would be considered biased.<br /><br />P.P.S. Brian, you might try dropping the price a little. Get more sales that way.
Before you consider throwing away money on this atrocious "film," know<br />that the product description is most definitely misleading.  Besides the<br />fact that the film is in no way close to being a "B-film" as mentioned in<br />the product description, this film is not made by Irish or Scotsmen, but<br />actually consists only of Texans.  This movie has no real association with<br />Irish or Scotsmen, and as for the acting it is merely reading lines at a<br />grammar school comprehension level, and the movie would be improved<br />drastically if edited to be a black and white silent movie.  Also, while<br />irresponsibly not mentioned anywhere about this product, it is by far not<br />appropriate for children.  Do not waste your money on this embarrassment,<br />because all you will get is 2 hours and 20 minutes of homophobic jokes and<br />film quality surpassed by high school AV club movies.
Take your $27 plus shipping and flush it down the toilet.  Perhaps some good can come from the money that you would have wasted watching this rip off.  I am not quite sure that Strangeheart technically qualifies as a movie per se.  I have yet to see a middle school play that was so poorly crafted, written or acted.  Drunk or not, what a pitiful excuse for a movie.  Find something better to do with your time.
