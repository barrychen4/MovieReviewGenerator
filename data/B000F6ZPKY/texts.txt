I've been listening to these guys for years and this is double iceing on any Blues fans cake. The audio and video are clean and well mixed. These guys are having fun and show it, good times for every one. If you've never heard these guys before you are in for a treat. I will say Kings vocals are not the best, never has been, but gets away with it due to style and soulful intent. This one's highly recomended for all the right reasons.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.<br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)<br /><br />1.*****<br />2.*****<br />3.*****<br /><br />Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.
This is a FANTASTIC DVD. No complaints at all. EVERY cut is great. A must for blues lovers. 5 STARS FOR SURE
I saw these guys a couple of weeks ago at the Durham Blues Fest. They kicked arse and stole the show. Awesome......
I have seen this band twice live and this DVD is a nice way to relive those memories.  The music is great and the film makes it fill like your right there.  I would have liked to seen more shots of the crowd and the bar but overall I loved it!!
I am so happy I bought the "My Heart's in Texas" DVD with Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King.  Out of the 50 plus blues and blues/rock DVD videos I have in my growing collection, this one is easily in my top five.  These guys are fantastic guitar players and Bnois King is a wonderful vocalist.  Smokin' Joe with his stinging licks and Bnois' melodious tones provide an awesome blend of their guitar playing styles.  They are good at seamlessly trading the lead back and forth.  If you like Texas style blues, you need this DVD for sure because this is Texas style blues at its rockin' best!  You won't believe your eyes and ears when you hit the play button with this disc in your player.  It is nearly impossible to sit still during this live performance as can be evidenced by the crowded dance floor at the J & J Blues Bar in Fort Worth, Texas where this show takes place.
This is right up there with the best of the blues DVD's.<br />These guys have some great music. The venue is small, the<br />crowd is so great, and the band is perfect. Smokin Joe and<br />Bnois are sooo tight on their Fender strats, and the drummer and<br />bass are simply locked. "Crazy World" and "Tell Me Why" are<br />incredible songs. I can't get them out of my head....so<br />I just play my bass along with em' cause this is one fine jam!<br />Wish I was there...hey, they're coming to Vegas on 08 and I WILL<br />BE THERE! A HighSierraBassPlayer Five-Star Thumbs UP!!!
If you need a little boost, something to get you going and feel a little better, put on this DVD and it should do the trick.  Most of the numbers are pretty uptempo and between Joe's licks and the guitar work of both he and Bnois King, you'll be pleased with this concert.<br /><br />I have to say I don't know if I have seen a concert filmed in what looks like such a small little bar! I don't know how they fit cameramen in to film it; it's pretty packed in this small Texas room, but everyone is having a good time.  People find space to dance, too, and get into it. This is good-time hard-driving Texas blues.  King's voice is different from any other blues singer I've heard, too, and it gives Kubek's band a different flavor.
If I owned a road house, These guys'd be my house band. I've been enjoying their CDs for years (I even tracked down a copy of 'The Axe Man'), and played this DVD back to back to back today.<br /><br />Their brand of Texas blues is unique because of Mr King's vocals. He has his own way, what most folks call smooth and jazzy, and I like it. Mr Kubek does most of the lead guitar, and stands shoulder to shoulder with the best you can name. (This is my opinion as a fan, not as a guitarist. I have zero musical talent.) They are about as different in style as is possible, but the interplay between them is very good. The rhythm section is rock solid.<br /><br />The audio quality is very good. The accoustics are way above normal for live shows. The mix is very nice too; it didn't sound compressed, or muddy, or bright. It is clean and allowed all instruments to be distinct.<br /><br />I wasn't as intent on the video as I was the audio, but I saw nothing wrong. It looked plenty clean and sharp to me.<br /><br />The short version is...<br />They're very talented and played a butt-kickin' set in a perfect venue with great accoustics.<br /><br />If you like this genre of music, I think you'll enjoy this show. There is also a CD from this show.<br /><br />joe
Good video, like being at the club (except the room was lit up a little more; understandable). The acoustic bonus track was no "bonus" though. Would have preferred something else (interview would have even been better).
I was there for this performance at J&J's, and can't wait to finally see an A+ professionally-produced DVD of this awesome band!<br /><br />If you can't get to a town where they're playing, you can finally see what you've been hearing on the CD's.  As a band, they're tight, and they were in great form on 12/31/05.  Joe makes his Stratocasters sing with seemingly no effort at all.  Bnois King counterpoints beautifully with his jazzy style and raspy-velvet vocals.  And there is no rhythm section in blues more solid than Paul Jenkins on bass, and Ralph Power on drums.<br /><br />If you have had the pleasure of seeing SJK live, now is your opportunity to show your friends, and to enjoy again and again!
I'VE REVIEWED ALOT OF BLUES DVD'S IN RECENT TIMES , BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE AS GOOD AS THIS!!!! SMOKIN JOE AND THE BOYS ARE A 10 STAR IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT IT WASN'T 2 HOURS LONG OR MORE. PLEASE DO ANOTHER DVD, SMOKIN JOE................
