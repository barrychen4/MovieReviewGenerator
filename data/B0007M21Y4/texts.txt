This movie with Gene Autry is a very entertaining film, it offers the standard fare viewers have come to expect from Flying A enterprise, yet the scenery and location shots add much to it.  Cacti are present in many shots, with rolling hills, and boulders all over the place. One of the highlights of the movie has to be that Gene sings "Back In The Saddle" while working for the medicine show.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is fairly simple and straight forward, after being released from prison for a robbery The Apache Kid is trailed by other black hats wanting the money. With Autry on the Kid's trail we know that the Kid (played by Dick Jones) will either be caught or repent. Well both can happen too.  Gail Davis, who became pretty much a standard in Autry enterprises eventually getting her own show as Annie Oakley, is in the movie, as well as Jones, who eventually joined The Range Rider show.  Oh, how I spent my high school years watching all this stuff. Great isn't it?<br /><br />Action aplenty in this black and white venture, too bad Gene didn't do this one in color, the Arizona background would look great. I'm assuming some scenes were filmed near Old Tucson as there just isn't that much cacti anywhere else in the west.<br /><br />Best in watching buckaroos.<br /><br />Semper Fi.
