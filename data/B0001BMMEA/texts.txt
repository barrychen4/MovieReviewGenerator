Dispite some people's opinions, G Gundam is a good anime series.  If you're a Gundam fan and watch the show because of its military theme, this show might not be for you.  In its own right it is still a great show, its just not the Gundam we're all used to.  I suggest getting the whole series, or a box set or something.  Buying only one DVD may leave you wanting for more.  This show is an older anime series (older meaning mid 1990s and earlier and lacking digital enhancement etc.), so the animation is not as sharp as some of the newer ones.<br /><br />The great thing about G Gundam is that it personifies the gundams.  Each fighter has his own style, and because of a piloting system (which blows the ones used in other Gundam series away), the mobile suits effectively embody the fighters themselves.  These gundams also do more than those in other gundam shows because they can move any way the fighter can.<br /><br />!CAUTION!  What I say here might offend DBZ fans: imagine DBZ but with huge mechas and no lousy storyboards which take literally 7 episodes to complete a battle.  This is what you get in G Gundam.<br /><br />I'll admit that the dialog can be corny at times, but this adds a certain comic element that might be otherwise lacking.  The director and producer of this series took it very seriously, and you should as well.<br />GUNDAM MATCH ALL SET.  READY...  GO!
This DVD is my favorite of all my G Gundam DVDs. It is so good! Everything comes to a climax in this DVD. Though i wont give any details to spoil it for you. Though I must say there is an event that i find so sad, in the last episode. I wanted to cry the first time i saw the episode on Cartoon Network You really must buy this DVD ,but buy rounds 1-5 too so you will know what is going on.
