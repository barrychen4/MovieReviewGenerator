My paranormal group will be going to the USS North Carolina within the next several months, and I wanted to get some ideas about the location, and I thought this video might be of some help.<br /><br />I had contemplated purchasing the DVD for $25, but I saw that it was only 30 minutes long. I did see there was the option to view it once on either  my PC or through my Roku box for $1.99, so I decided to go that route. I felt that if the video had plenty of good content, as far as paranormal hot spots and a decent tour of the ship, I would go ahead and purchase the DVD version. I'm glad that I didn't get the DVD version.<br /><br />Danny Bradshaw is the night watchman for the ship, and he is the primary focus within the video. Danny has been there for 33yrs and he's had several experiences there during that period. He did mention a couple of other people having experiences as well, and I should mention that he also has a room on the ship.<br /><br />The amateur looking video is loaded with promotions for all sorts of things unrelated to the ship, and Danny also has several moments with promoting his book, urging people to buy it because the money would go to a relative's trust fund. I get the sense that the proceeds of this video is also going towards that trust fund too.<br /><br />Danny talked several times about how the book contained 13 paranormal stories, with eleven being things that he experienced and two from other people. I got the sense the video was a teaser towards buying the book, and during the video, I saw that Danny held the book in such a fashion to where I could see that it was extremely thin; I'd have to guess that it might be about a quarter inch thick.<br /><br />Danny told several ghost stories about things that happened in his room, in the bullpen, and in the mess hall. I can't be sure if he actually told all thirteen stories or not during the video, but to me, it felt like he didn't. At the end of the video, I had a great sense of disappointment at feeling the video was loaded with promos and very little content. I think that I would have been very angry if I had paid $25 instead of the $1.99. I didn't actually time the amount of content versus the promos, but if I had to take a wild guess, I would have to say there might have been +/- 15 minutes.<br /><br />If you absolutely positively have to view this video, I would suggest watching it for the price of $1.99 instead of purchasing the $25 DVD video. If the video is any indication on how well the book might be, I feel that I well be skipping that as well.
I cannot believe I just paid $1.99 to rent this. I thought it was going to be a movie. It is misleading. All it is, is an author trying to promote his book. he told a couple of ghost stories, and just talked about his book mostly. To be honest, i had to check to make sure this wasn't a trailer for a movie, but it was supposed to be a movie. I wish I could get my money back. I cannot even imagine why they would charge $25.00 to buy this. Maybe if it were an actual movie, but it wasn't even slightly remotely a movie, just some guy saying over and over to buy his book. Unbelievable. I just got ripped off.
stories of our Navy people who give thier lives to defend our Constitution and our way of life we so love, who still seem to be on our USS North Carolina which is on display down on our coast
As soon as I knew about this movie I bought it. I just knew it would be a fabulous. I was not disappointed. Thought about sending it to my Mom, but decided to keep it so I can view it again and again. I'll order my mother another one. Danny tells what happens as he saw it. I read his book too. Now,I believe the Battleship has Ghosts.
