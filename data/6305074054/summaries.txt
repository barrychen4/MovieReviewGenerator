A flawed classic and guilty pleasure
A Guilty Pleasure
SUPERGIRL
Maybe not four stars.
Lighten Up! It's A Comic Strip!
Who says a &quot;Man&quot; can be Super?!
Give This Film A Chance People!  :)
TERRIBLY FLAWED, BUT ENTERTAINING
Bad Video Quality, Good Movie
I love this movie, it ROCKS!!!
Mediocre story, mediocre SFX, just plain mediocre!
