The emphasis in the title is "Island."  This does not cover all of Asia.  It focuses on Java and the islands near it.  This work begins and then ends with the top of the food chain: leopards on some islands and lizards on others.  I had always heard that animals become smaller the longer their species survive on islands; this documentary says that's true for some, but for others they do become larger.<br />The work shows diverse life: mammals, insects, reptiles, birds, and trees.  It even includes a marsupial!  The work shows one primate that is large and diurnal and then its relative that is small and nocturnal.  The documentary is realistic by showing nocturnal animals moving around at night, but as a human with my limited vision, it was difficult to see those creatures.  I wish they could have shown a drawing of them so that I could tell what they looked like.  The work discusses a parasitic tree that strangles the tree it surrounds.<br />Figs seem to be what keeps all these island dwellers alive.  (Personally, I don't like the figs that I've eaten, so it was different to see them as a food essential.)  In the way that some fish have mouth closer to the ground, some parallel to their eyes, and some closer to the water surface, this work says some figs grow near leaves like typical fruit, some lie on the tree (I would say like acne), and some have figs that grow near the ground.  Each fig had a different animal that spreads its seeds.<br />The work shows an island that just arose 70 years ago and then it shows the procession of animals that arrive there.  It was almost like watching a genesis.  The work said there are only 70 Javan rhinos left.  I had heard that a species must have at least 150 members to survive, but this documentary never says whether that rhino is already doomed.<br />One critique I have is that the English captions show "it's" when the narrator means "its."  Fire the staff member responsible for those typos!
