The movie is awesome and romantic,It is definite worth watching and buying. Hilary duff is wonderful and fantastic acting. Please remember your wanting to know if the movie is good. I have read reviews on the movie and got I hate Hilary Duff Campaign. Their just trashing Hilary and not really rating a true honest opinion about the movie. Buy the movie you will not regret it!
I'm not going to rip Hilary Duff apart like a previous reviewer because I actually think she was about the best part of this film, hence the one star. It's fun and girly but I couldn't enjoy it because of the constant stereotypes (i.e. blonde girl enters the business world and doesn't know anything apart from how to utilize colour, as well as the consistent way the female characters judge men by their 'hot abs' or 'tight asses'). It just seems a bit sexist in terms of both the male and female characters and, while I know most chick flicks are like this to some extent, it has never been to the extent that I've felt the need to switch off. The English guy's accent is laughable. Why don't they just use English people to portray English people rather than people whose accent flips between Australian and American? The other characters besides Lane are pretty rubbish and wooden, including her best friend and more or less all the people she works with. The story, I guess, is light-hearted and cutesy, but if you have an ounce of intellect and don't assume that all women are bimbos whose specialist subject is coats and men's worth is assessed by the tightness of their buns, I suggest looking elsewhere. I was also a little concerned about the sexual references (i.e. painting each others bodies with chocolate and then 'burning it off' after one date, talk of climaxing etc.). Surely that's a bit much for a younger audience?
This is a Hillary Duff made-for-TV movie, so I probably didn't come into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048KQQCE">Beauty & the Briefcase</a> with particularly high expectations. However, they were met, and even exceeded some - for a romantic comedy. Working as an investigative journalist for Cosmo, Duff joins an investment banking firm to find an eligible bachelor in New York. There are some cute moments about having unrealistic expectations for a man. As with most romantic comedies, it's lighthearted and cheesy. Yet, unlike many, the protagonists - particularly Duff - come off as relatively normal, likable, and not pathetically desperate. Sure, they have their quirks and faults, but I never felt annoyed by their characters but rather sorry for them. Fun for date nights with a significant other.<br /><br />**Spoilers Alert**<br /><br />I did think the subplot with Liam was distracting. First of all, it was too obvious Duff's character wouldn't end up with him - he was TOO perfect. More importantly, it took time and attention away from the idea of dating in the business world. This theme could have been played up a lot more than what is actually captured in the movie. In fact, there are really 2 guys in the office who are really even "contenders." Instead, I could easily have imagined the "Liam" character changed into one of Duff's coworkers, but one who it turns out was engaged in shady stock deals or something. I reduced my rating by a star because there was just so much more comedic potential in mixing the women's fashion and men's business worlds.
I had no idea what to expect from this movie when I watched the DVD at a friend's house. First of all, let me tell you I am a 41 year old gay man so hardly the target audience for Hillary Duff movies, but I have to say I found this really fun and enjoyable. It reminded me a lot of "Legally Blonde" or "Clueless" for that kind of "Oh my god" kind of girl that Hillary portrayed. Given it was an ABC Family movie, I thought it might be too pre-teen and "Disney" in the scenarios portrayed, but instead, it was focused more on the young-executive business world. Like I said, it was like "Legally Blonde" but set in an office environment rather than a political one. Matt Dallas of "Kyle XY" fame has a supporting role here which was pleasantly surprising, as he plays a mid-twenties businessman convincingly (which I realize is his real age, but still strange after watching him for years as a 16 year old on "Kyle XY".) Also notable is the supporting character played by Chris Carmack (of "The OC" and "Into the Blue 2") who adopts a very unconvincing British accent that I can't believe would fool anyone and frankly just sounds ridiculous. I can't say anymore about that without creating a spoiler for the movie. In the end, I do recommend this movie for anyone in the mood for some mindless fun fluff that would appeal to adults. Teens might actually not be quite into this as they might not yet have enough life experience to relate to the office environment most of this movie is based in.
"Beauty & the Briefcase" has its share of charming, embarrassingly funny moments but works for an ABC Family romantic comedy.<br /><br />Actress Hilary Duff is all grown up and she returns in a "Sex and the City-esque" style of storyline in "Beauty & the Briefcase", an ABC Family television film that is an adaptation of the novel "Diary of a Working Girl" by Daniella Brodsky.  The film featured a collaboration with ABC Family and Cosmopolitan magazine and aired on April 18, 2010 and attracted 2.4 million viewers.  The TV film was nominated for "Favorite Family TV Movie" for the People's Choice Awards 2011.<br /><br />The film is directed by Gil Junger (popular TV director and director for "10 Things I Hate About You" movie and TV series, "Greek", "Hope & Faith", "According to Jim") and a screenplay adaptation by Michael Horowitz ("Burn Notice").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"Beauty & the Briefcase" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 1:78:1).  The film was shot using an F23 Sony camera in progressive HD and for a TV movie, the film looks very good, especially with shots of Lane walking through New York.  If anything, the film manages to show the vibrancy of New York as well as the fashion elements from the film but it works for a TV film, I didn't notice any high-details when it came to objects, clothing or skin pigmentation as you would see from a feature film but nevertheless, "Beauty & the Briefcase" does showcase colors which are vibrant and also didn't notice the artifacts and coloration problems that I tend to see with TV episodes or some TV films.<br /><br />"Beauty & the Briefcase" definitely looks stylish and colorful and fans of the TV film will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Beauty & the Briefcase" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The soundtrack is pretty much front and center-channel driven but noticed sometimes you will hear the music being played through the surround channels but dialogue is clear as with its musical soundtrack but for the most part, not an immersive lossless soundtrack.  I was hoping to hear more crowd ambiance from the club scenes or the corporate building that Lane works but it's not well-utilized through the surround channels as I would have hoped for.  But still, for those that don't have a home theater setup should be fine as the TV film is clear through the front and center channels.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English and English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Beauty & the Briefcase" comes with no special features but a trailer (1:07) for the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Before I begin with my review, I want to emphasize that this is an ABC Family TV film and if you are familiar with Gil Junger films such as "10 Things I Hate About You" and films or TV series with Hilary Duff, these two work well together for "Beauty & the Briefcase" as it is a simple romantic comedy and literally a film that showcases Hilary Duff, the young adult actress and separating her from the teenage characters that many are used to her playing.<br /><br />Many audiences have grown up with watching Duff in "Lizzy McGuire" and so, to have her in a role as a young adult, working in the fashion world and looking beautiful as ever, her fans will definitely enjoy this film. Especially fans of Matt Dallas of the defunct ABC Family show "Kyle XY" and Chris Charmack of "The O.C.".  The film also features Jaime Pressly and also a cameo appearance by Jennifer Coolidge ("American Pie", "Joey", "The Secret Life of the American Teenager").<br /><br />So, first the good.  The good news about "Beauty & The Briefcase" is it has its positive moments.  Lane in New York, the cinematography featuring her walking through New York is beautiful, the vibrant colors featured in the film is beautiful and the "Sex and the City"-like storyline is going to appeal to many of the female viewers.  It's a fun romantic comedy that has its charming moments but also its embarrassing moments and it works for an ABC Family TV film.  It's stylishly cute and as a guy watching the film, I have to admit that Hilary Duff looks great!<br /><br />But while "Sex and the City" worked because of its adult theme, it's the portrayal of Lane (Duff's character) that actually irked me.  For one, it's seemed like a stereotypical role of portraying a dumb blonde. Yes, she's a journalist and obviously has intelligence but when she tries to get a job at the Investment company, her immature way of getting the job to how she would try to make her desk fashionable with beads and such, yes I understand she comes from the fashion world but I have met many women from the fashion industry and to portray them in this manner, is just crazy (especially in this day and age).<br /><br />In one scene, while Lane's boss Tom (played by Michael McMillian) and Seth (played by Matt Dallas) are in a teleconference with their boss, Lane manages to get into the camera while putting files or books away and she is bending over and literally catching the eyes of their boss, as well as Tom and Seth.<br /><br />Now, I don't if these type of scenes are detailed in Daniella Brodsky's book "Diary of a Working Girl" or these were added by Michael Horowitz.  So, I'm not sure how the actually novel differs from the TV film adaptation.<br /><br />Also, I didn't like the sudden shift of how Tom finds out that Lane has been working at the company undercover.  It seemed too abrupt.  But at the same time, there are differences on how feature films and TV films play out and everything is built around how sequences end before a commercial and how a scene begins after a commercial.  It's the nature of TV films and when it comes to pacing, these things happen.<br /><br />But another downer for me was the fact that there are no special features.  It would have been great to have featurettes, blooper reels and if ABC Family did have these in their DVD releases of their TV series, I don't see why they couldn't add them to their TV film releases on Blu-ray.  In this day and age, especially on Blu-ray, barebone Blu-ray releases are not cool!<br /><br />But overall, "Beauty & the Briefcase" does have its charming and fun moments and despite how the characters are portrayed or the film's pacing, for those just wanting a not-so-serious but fun romantic comedy, this film may be for you.
I've been a fan of Hilary Duff for years, and I like most of the movies she has been in. Hilary has the it factor. I like how nice Hilary has always been. I think Hilary is one of the best actresses, and role models, and singers there is. She is great at everything she does, that's why she is so successful. This movie is hilarious. Hilary has a great sense of humor. Hilary plays Lane Daniels a journalist looking for the right man, her magic man. In this movie Lane fakes that she knows everything about business, to get a man, and a job of her dreams. It seems like everything is falling apart for Lane, because she lied, but it's not so bad after all. Lane gets a second chance redemption. At the end of this movie it made me tear up a little. Lane's perfect man has been in front of her the whole time, but she didn't see it, because she was too concentrated on finding the guy she wanted. It's sad Hilary hasn't been in as much movies as she was when she was younger. I can't wait to see more from her. Overall this movie will make you laugh a lot, and it's really great.
They always ship it to me before the E.T.A. and the movies are always in spectacular condition!  I would recommend this company to family and friends.
My son is a big fan of Hilary Duff ever since she had launched her career with Disney Channel.  He has enjoyed all her family orientated films.
This was a cute movie to pass the time. I didnt love it but would watch again if I was bored.
this movie was pretty entertaining. i love hillary duff. i've thought she was excellent in this movie. and the story was pretty good to. this is a good romantic comedy about finding the one in the unsual places.  if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
Hilary Duff does a great job in this light hearted romantic comedy.  She portrays Lane Daniels a young journalist trying to make the best of an opportunity to land a job at Cosmopolitan by going undercover to write an article about finding love in the business world. Lane has a checklist of attributes that her perfect man will have.  Her search for the perfect man leads her on a long and funny journey of self discovery.<br /><br />In this role Hilary Duff returns to the type of comedy role that made her famous as Lizzie McGuire. There is a good mix of physical comedy and lovable character flaws that make this film fun to watch.  All in all this a good clean comedy that's fun for everyone 13 & up.
i bought this movie because i'm a huge hilary fan and love love love it , and if i wasn't a hilary fan i would still buy it because it so funny and delightful and you will enjoy ever minute of it , believe me you wont regret buying it .
Yes finally Hilary Duff is back... love this movie is great to watch with girlfriends Hilary is not a little girl anymore, I must say her last 2 movies were awful but this one I did enjoy a lot...
please note that the 4 stars does not make it a great mvie..  lit's a cute chick flick for a saturday nite when nothing else is going on.  I liked it.  it is clean and sweet.
Did not care for this movie at all! Boring and worthless plot! Wish I could get my time and money back!
Beauty & The Briefcase is a cute movie, not only that it's funny too. It has a few things that could use some work, but other than that it's a good movie. If you're looking for a good chick flick, this is an excellent choice. It has romance, humor, style and class. I didn't think I would like it that much, being a Duff fan, but it's a good movie.

Watch this movie and discover a uniquely wonderful actress, already a master of heartfelt emotion, subtle grace and eloquent interpretations of scenes. While this movie is definitely a dramedy, in the very end, it became a testament to love. Listen closely to Hilary's delicious diction, especially in the beginning of the movie, and by the end of the movie, you'll discover the love in her voice and the love she imbued the character with is just amazingly beautiful beyond just Hilary being an amazingly beautiful woman in every way.<br /><br />Superficially, there's an amazing series of outfits and hair styles that I have no names for! Hey, I'm a guy. Yes, the movie has a promiscuous bent to it and Hilary's little show for the benefit of the guys in the conference room will be memorable and you'll find that scene already on "those" web sites.<br /><br />Yet, to only see the superficial or to have too many preconceptions based on her former work means missing out on her natural and experienced talent at layering meaning, comedy, emotional depth and endless sweetness and sexiness in her art. I already pre-ordered 10! There's a DVD and blu-ray version!
I found this movie absolutely delightful! Ah who would not want to be in her shoes surrounded by elegantly dressed gentlemen who made good money in investment banking? I would and I have been in her shoes so I found it refreshing to reminisce on my days in investment banking! This movie is a keeper full of laughs, great clothes, delicious male eye candy and the beautiful backdrop of New York City; who could ask for more? Five well earned directing stars for Hilary Duff, she gets more beautiful and talented with time!
