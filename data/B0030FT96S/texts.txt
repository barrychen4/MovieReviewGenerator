Pieniadze to Nie Wszystko (Money isn't Everything) is a comedy about capitalism but as the title suggests, there is more to life than money.  The co-owners of a successful wine company have conflict when Tomasz Adamczyk (Marek Kondrat) wants to leave the business.  His wife Natalia (Magdalena Wojcik) isn't too happy with the idea and neither is her brother Wieslaw Turkot (Andrzej Chyra).  Adamczyk has a car accident while traveling through the countryside and the villagers there see him as an opportunity.  At first they think they can ransom him, but once they find out his brother-in-law doesn't want to pay, they want him to come up with his own ransom money.  As you can image, the story does get a little ridiculous but that is what makes it fun.<br /><br />What gives the movie its special charm and a lot of its humor is the country bumpkins.  They spend most of their day drinking and sitting on benches - they philosophize, they talk politics, and most of all, they would want to be rich but don't know how to do it.  The villagers actually do not have much ambition, but with the right leadership they could accomplish a lot.  Their beliefs and mannerisms are hilarious.<br /><br />Pieniadze to Nie Wszystko is a great comedy by Juliusz Malchulski.  Although it isn't one of his best known, it is one that is very fun and nearly resembles a feel-good movie.  You'll see for yourself that money isn't everything but everything without money is nothing.  Malchulski's specialty is comedy and has the distinction of having one of his movies, Seksmisja, being in the top ten all time Polish box office hits.  If you want to take a break from the serious movies, this one provides great comic relief.
