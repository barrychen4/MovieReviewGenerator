Had a wonderful month in February coming home everyday from work to watch Boy Meets World; felt like TGIF every night. I miss my generation's wonderful shows and this set fulfilled a lot of those missed memories.
First off, I have to say that I love this show. So why the 1 star rating? Because this set is not worth it!! I just bought these items individually at about $12 each!!. These 4 seasons come out to about $17 each. I'm trying to save some people money!
This is a great tv show for all ages.  Its funny and teaches you a lot about dealing with situations as you grow up.  The characters are great and very likable.  You will laugh, cry, and learn a few things as well.
I used to watch these shows years ago. It takes me back when my husband and I watch them again on DVD.
