these are older westerns but are still very cool to watch. many in the vein of Clint Eastwoods westerns. i enjoyed quite a few of these 20 movies. the picture quality is good and theres lots of action. i recommend.
A collection of Westerns with some good and bad movies.  Most of the movies are older and some have lower quality pictures and soundtracks as well.
st. clair is one of the best when it comes to these movie sets and once again they have come through with this set of spaghetti westerns. sorry i don't have a list of movies but while the movies are a mixed bag of good to ok westerns the set is great. the movies all look good and the set as with all their sets has a few extras. so check it out!!!!!!!!!!!
lots of low-quality stuff that has been circling around for years, also lots of ripping-off of other companies without paying them. Overall: hands off of this if you value these movies.
