Unlike "CN Halloween Volume 3", "CN Christmas Volume 3" is probably the best one yet !  Here's a look at what episodes this DVD has:<br /><br />Camp Lazlo: "Snow Beans" - For the first time on DVD, see Lazlo and his fellow Bean Scouts as they take a ski trip in the mountains.<br /><br />Billy and Mandy: "Billy and Mandy Save Christmas" - The greatest holiday special to date features our two young heroes and the Grim Reaper as they rescue Santa who has turned into a vampire.<br /><br />Foster's: "Store Wars" - Bloo and the gang head to the mall as they search for the perfect birthday present for Madame Foster.<br /><br />Ed, Edd n Eddy: "In Like Ed" - Kevin knows too much.  This misconception leads to a covert operation conducted by the Eds themselves.<br /><br />Kids Next Door: "Operation N.A.U.G.H.T.Y." - The Delightful Children from Down the Lane attempt to ruin Christmas by taking all the presents in the world while the KND takes the blame.<br /><br />I'm surprised there are only FIVE shows on this DVD.  Maybe they ought to throw in at least one of the following:<br /><br />Courage the Cowardly Dog: "Snowman's Revenge" - The North Pole is suffering global warming, and the sinister Snowman decides to make a new home... at Courage's home !<br /><br />Johnny Bravo: "Johnny on Ice" - Bravo accidentally gets frozen in a chunk of ice.  A scientist later thaws him out thinking that he's the missing link.<br /><br />Dexter's Lab: "A Mom Cartoon" - Dexter's mother goes holiday shopping and fights -that's right, FIGHTS- her way towards the last pair of latex gloves.<br /><br />I Am Weasel: "The Legend of Big Butt" - Paranormalists Weasel and Baboon take a trip to the Himalayas in search of the elusive creature Big Butt.<br /><br />My Gym Partner's a Monkey: "Cool Kids" - Jake Spidermonkey becomes part of the "in-crowd" at the school's polar classes.<br /><br />They'll probably save that last one as well as the Foster's Christmas special, "A Lost Claus", for Volume 4 next year.
Although I enjoyed all of the shows on this DVD, the title is deceptive. The "Camp Lazlo" episode has nothing to do with anything. The "Ed,Edd n Eddy" and "Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends" episodes are based on bithdays ... so "The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy" and "Codename Kids Next Door" are the only two episodes based on X-mas. The DVD is promoted as Cartoon Network Christmas 3 leading you to believe that the cartoons would be based around X-mas episodes. Don't get me wrong, all the episodes were good with minor distractions (heavy blinking) where commericals were to be inserted in the longer shows. Overall, I enjoyed this DVD as a lot of the good cartoons are very rarely shown anymore.
This definitely was not what my kids and I were expecting - christmas you would think would mean christmas episodes but not so much
The selection of programs didn't fit the title.  Only three of the programs involved Christmas and a couple weren't worth the time to watch. On the good side, the product was received in excellent condition and played without difficulty.
