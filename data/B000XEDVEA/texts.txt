I have been purchasing art books, videos, and DVD's for a long time and without a doubt, this is the best DVD for those who want to learn how a great painter paints. I am primarily an oil landscape painter but I have found this particular DVD of Reid painting the figure in watercolor translates well for providing tips for people who use any painting medium, style, or subject matter. Charles Reid is a true American master and it is fascinating to be able to view him working and be able to watch how he does what he does. I have watched this DVD a few times already and I keep finding new and intrigueing tips. A great DVD for anyone interested in painting and a must for those interested in watercolor and or the figure.
I have books by Charles Reid and was delighted to have the DVD to see how he actually paints.  He has a very loose style that is deceptivally easy.  This shows him painting and flinging paint at the support as he paints.  Many water colorists are very uptight and rigid but not Mr. Reid.  He abounds in lost edges, splatters, juicy paints and he does not paint inside the lines.  If you have a tight way of painting with lots of hard edges, then this is the book to help you escape into a different style that is more relaxed.
I feel the same as the other reviewers, that this is a very good DVD.  I have lots of books on watercolor, but I haven't seen someone like Charles Reid paint before, so it was very helpful to see his technique.  It made me realize what I might do differently.  I was surprised at how wet he works, and how he isn't restricted by his under-drawing.  Overall, a very helpful video for a struggling painter to watch.
