It's good generally for beginners interested in flamenco. There is a lot of information so you would have to take it all in in small increments. For those who are more advanced in "flamencology,"  there is also a great deal of interesting history and detail that I know you can't possibly know unless you've lived and worked in the flamenco world in Andalucia. The alphabetical format is easy to follow- & it's just as it suggests- a dvd dictionary. The artists demonstrating all the cante, baile, & history are pretty good for demonsration purposes only. Don't get the dvd expecting to see the greatest dancers and singers of all time but if you want to learn terminology, styles, and styles within the styles from different regions- it is very recommendable. For serious students of flamenco- it's not very entertaining where you are glued to the t.v. but you can learn immensely from it & it should help you better understand this genre of music & lifestyle. I give it 5 stars for the educational material. Ole
Truly liked this informative video.  Nicely made...I recommend it to those who want to know more about flamenco.  Enjoy and...Oleee!!!
this DVD is very educational. Perfect for the flamenco dancing and musci student. One learns things about the genre that takes years to learn/understand in the classroom setting.
