Its nice that this show has finally been released on DVD. The stage set is a historic one and great to be preserved on video. Just a shame that it wasn't filmed with Randy Rhoads on lead guitar, who just missed this filming. How great would that have been.<br /><br />The good: the stage set and show. Tommy Aldridge on drums. Rudy Sarzo on bass (although he has a one-dimensional stage presence, just bobbing his head and licking his fingers...it does get old after awhile). Brad Gillis does a good job on guitar, considering how fast he was thrown in there and had to learn the complex material. His guitar tone gets annoying after awhile, but he's still fun to watch. Also the camera doesn't dart all over the place a gazillion times a minute like alot of newer filmed concerts do. (i dont' know why they insist on editing alot of newer concerts that way...they're nearly unwatchable because of it).<br /><br />Now for the bad: For anyone that thinks Ozzy sounds good....those vocals have been fixed up and over-dubbed. Big time. This isn't new. It was done way back right after it was filmed, so all the VHS and other releases feature this too. At times, its painful to look at because the overdubbed vocals are so OBVIOUS. On occasion, Ozzy's mouth is moving after the vocals stop, and vice-versa. On the real concert tape of this show, Ozzy sounds HORRIBLE.<br /><br />All in all, still a good release, although not a great one due to the overdubbed and studio fixups afterward and the great Randy Rhoads not being involved (although there's nothing anyone can do about that).<br />Hopefully they release the "Bark at the Moon" 1984 Salt Lake City show thats floating around right now on bootleg DVD. That show is much better than this one with even a better stage show to boot...not to mention the great Jake E Lee on guitar. Thats a 4/5 star show. I would give this one a solid 2 1/2 stars.
This is an old school Ozzy concert.  Following the death of Randy Rhoads, Ozzy recruited Bernie Torme to play guitar, but that didn't last terribly long.  To fill out the rest of the concert dates, Ozzy brought in Brad Gillis to play guitar with the band that was already in place.  The lineup here is:<br /><br />Ozzy Osbourne - Vocals<br />Brad Gillis - Guitar<br />Rudy Sarzo - Bass<br />Tommy Aldridge - Drums<br />Don Airey - Keyboards<br />John Allen - The Dwarf (hey, it's in the credits!)<br /><br />When you look at all the combinations that have been in Ozzy's solo band over the years, this one isn't usually rated terribly high.  I don't know why, because I thought this was an underrated combination.  Given the year this was recorded (1982), the track listing is solely off Ozzy's first two solo albums, and the usual handful of Black Sabbath tracks thrown in there.  I suppose the backlash against this lineup came later on, because I remember when this first came out, it was all over MTV in 1983, and those of us who were lucky enough to have VCR's back then recorded it.  My old VHS copy is long since gone, so I'm glad that this came out finally so I can relive those memories.  Brad Gillis has a style that isn't terribly like Randy Rhoads, Tony Iommi, or Ozzy's later guitarists (Jake, Gus, or Zakk in particular).  But I remember being a fan when this was the incumbent incarnation, and I really liked it.  Plus in 1983, you don't have the absolute glut of available video you do these days, and this video was pretty much all you could get if you wanted to see an Ozzy concert on your TV.<br /><br />Brad later went on to a long career with Night Ranger after this (and could be where some of the backlash came from, as "Sister Christian" tainted their image).  Don Airey played with everyone under the sun, and is now a member of Deep Purple.  Rudy played with a bunch of people over the years as well, most notably Blue Oyster Cult & Dio.  Tommy also played with a bunch of others (Whitesnake (with Rudy), Gary Moore, & Thin Lizzy.  So this lineup has done a lot, they weren't scrubs at all.<br /><br />Check out this video, it brings back a lot of good memories for me, and is a great video.<br /><br />A few notes about the actual DVD.  It's pretty bare bones.  On the disc is the concert, and that's it.  No extras of any kind.  It runs 78 minutes, and has some audio selections (5.1, DTS, 2.0 Stereo).<br /><br />Full Track Listing:<br /><br />Intro<br />Over the Mountain<br />Mr. Crowley<br />Crazy Train<br />Revelation (Mother Earth)<br />Steal Away (The Night)<br />Suicide Solution<br />Guitar Solo<br />Drum Solo<br />Goodbye to Romance<br />I Don't Know<br />Believer<br />Flying High Again<br />Iron Man<br />Children of the Grave<br />Paranoid (Encore)<br /><br />One final note - Tommy Aldridge in his drum solo does a thing he's known for - that's a "no sticks" drum solo where he plays the solo with just his hands; no drumsticks.<br /><br />The concert is a good one, and the price is pretty cheap, so it's worth a pickup for someone who is into Sabbath & Ozzy.  I rated it just 4 out of 5 because of the total lack of extras.  I would have gotten a kick out of seeing the old JJ Jackson intros for this from MTV.<br /><br />UPDATE: Eagle Rock has posted a video of the entire "Crazy Train" song from this concert.  Check it out: [...]
I'm giving this five stars because of its historical and nostalgic value, and for the amazing performance of the band.  The overdubbing on Ozzy's vocals would pull it down to a four if not for the quality of the whole package, which documents heavy metal at its glorious 1980's best.<br /><br />This concert was recorded June 12, 1982 during the Diary of a Madman tour, less than three months after the death of Randy Rhoads.  It's not the same as the CD version, featuring mostly songs from Ozzy's first two solo albums.  Ozzy delivered the goods to the crowd at Irvine Meadows in California, bellowing and running around the stage like a...well, a madman...jumping up and down, clapping and headbanging relentlessly.  He deserves credit for pulling off the rest of that tour after such a terrible tragedy.<br /><br />Brad Gillis, Rudy Sarzo, Tommy Aldridge, and Don Airey are all spectacular backing up the Ozz-man.  The performance of Gillis is nothing less than stunning.  His solo after Suicide Solution, and the subsequent instrumental piece by the band that culminates with Tommy's drum solo, is nearly worth the price of the DVD alone.  Tommy's solos were legendary, climaxing with his feverish hands-only routine.  Rudy Sarzo matches the frantic energy of Gillis, bookending Ozzy with pure heavy metal ferocity.<br /><br />The set and show production exemplify the epic grandeur of 80's concerts.  A huge medieval castle flanks the band.  Airey, cloaked in a black reaper's robe, occupies a balcony of the castle.  A huge laser-light winged bat flies over the band and menaces the crowd.  Aldridge sits atop a huge pyramidal drum riser.  Everything about the staging is humongous, reminding me how much more theatrical big concerts used to be.  It's without question an incredible show to watch.<br /><br />The sound and the picture are good on the DVD.  I don't hear any flaws in the sound, and while the picture might look somewhat fuzzy at times, I like it that way.  TV broadcasts from that era (this was shown on MTV Halloween night) all have that look, and it adds to the vintage feel.  The DVD also comes with a booklet that includes some cool pictures and a piece by Rudy Sarzo about participating in the tour.  It's a nice extra.<br /><br />Even though there are quite a few moments when Ozzy's mouth clearly doesn't match up with the vocals, it does seem like the real vocals are used from time to time.  And all of his shouting and bantering with the crowd is obviously original audio.  Some people have said some of the vocal tracks sound the same as Tribute, but I don't think it is.  There are several songs where Ozzy changes a few notes or his phrasing, and those clearly are not on other live releases.  Overall, I'm very happy they finally put this out officially on DVD.  I see it as a must-have for hardcore Ozzy fans.
I am so glad to see this FINALLY come to official release.<br />I have had this on VHS then to bootleg ( AND EDITED) DVD . . . to a DVD that had Japanese writing on the screen. I have NEVER understood why SPEAK OF THE DEVIL hasn't been available till now.<br /><br />That said -<br /><br />This show is absolutely KILLER ! It is sad that it was on the wake of Randy's death but Brad Gillis is just ridiculously on TOP of the game! His quick learning of the material and the deadly tone of his Mesa/Boogie Mark2C amps and his outlaw red 1962 Fender strat just boggle the mind.<br /> It is also important (I think) to realize that the tremolo bar Brad uses is like the number FOUR 'Original' Floyd Rose that Floyd himself was hand-crafting  in His basement.<br />The locking tremolo was just becoming into circulation and even though Eddie Van Halen had one already and was using it - Brad just wrote His own book about it.<br /><br />There are TOO many highlights to this AWESOME SHOW -but for me, the song 'Suicide Solution' comes close to the top! Brad Gillis and his Floyd Rose techniques at the middle to end of the song and THEN His solo,  becomes almost something that Floyd Rose should included in the box of EVERY tremolo unit He sells. SIMPLY DEVASTATING guitar work!<br /><br />SPEAK of the Devil is a piece of Metal History that THANK GOD is now being preserved. I thought for sure it would be lost to bootleg - if at all.<br /><br />OZZY moves on - Brad goes back to Night Ranger - and all we have is this.<br />THANK YOU EAGLEROCK !<br /><br />AAA+++!!!
The date was June 12, 1982.  Twelve weeks earlier, during a break to the history-making Diary of a Madman Tour, Ozzy Osbourne's high profile guitarist, Randy Rhoades, died tragically and needlessly in a private plane crash.  Ozzy wrote years later in his autobiography that, "I don't think I want to be a rock `n roller anymore."<br /><br />However, as the old saying goes, the show must go on and the tour picked up where it had left off.  In the unenviable position of having to fill the shoes of Randy Rhoades, Brad Gillis was the guitar slinger who ultimately filled the role - and quite well, as a matter of fact. He gelled nicely and seamlessly with Ozzy, Rudy Sarzo (bass), Don Airey (keyboards), and Tommy Aldridge (drums).<br /><br />The dynamic of the band was captured on film that night of June 12th during an epic performance at Irvine Meadows.  The audio has been digitally restored and re-mastered in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound and in DTS and is being offered to Ozzy fans on crystal clear DVD.<br /><br />All the songs in the entire performance are noteworthy.  Particular Boomerocity favorites are:<br /><br />The concert opener, Over the Mountain, the opening track of the album that served as the tour's namesake had the crowd immediately on its feet and kept them there for the entire show.  Set against a then-precedent setting stage and backdrop, the audience was in mesmerized pleasure until the final song of the show.<br /><br />From Ozzy's first album, Blizzard of Oz, is the heavy metal staple, Crazy Train, which Ozzy and the boys perform flawlessly.<br /><br />Finally, from my high school day is the memorable Black Sabbath classic, Paranoid, from Ozzy's tenure with the band, is delivered as the final song of the evening, giving young and "old" fans alike a taste of original heavy metal.<br /><br />Whether you're an Ozzy fan or a Black Sabbath fan, you'll definitely want this DVD as part of your collection.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
I was at this concert.  It is great to see the band and the stage set up once again.  Brad had huge shoes to fill after Randy died.  After seeing them on New Year's eve in Los Angeles with Randy, it was hard for all us fans to accept the new guitarist.  Ozzy was in a funk, as were all of us less than 3 months after that tragic day.  But, listening to the solos, I respect Brad Gillis more and more.  He displays lots of subtle magic.  The DVD title is the same as the great CD of the same tour. The camera angles and cuts are perfect.  The sound and video quality are very good. Heartfelt liner notes from Rudy Sarzo too. I recommend this video.  So glad they finally released it.  OZZY! OZZY! OZZY!
I really enjoyed this concert, after so many years, it's finally been released! The tracks were Awesome, what i didn't like about it was the footage wasn't remastered, anyways the concert was Awesome, i Love how they opened with Over The Mountain! For any Ozzy fan this concert is Awesome N Amazing!!
This DVD is excellent.  Ozzy is in top form, and the rest of the band is very tight.  The sound quality is very good.  The video quality could be better, but I realize the technology is from 30 years ago.  If you're an Ozzy fan, you need this DVD.  The only downside is the absence of Randy Rhoads.
This is not the DVD version of Speak of the Devil. Speak of the Devil was an incredible live album of ALL BLACK SABBATH songs performed by this band. I can't believe I'm the first person to point this out.
My checklist for a great DVD: 1) Ozzy - check.  2) Concert Video - check.  Let me see...checking my list, checking it twice....yep, 5 stars.  Seriously, though, this is a great concert.  I actually saw this tour, with this exact lineup, back in Ann Arbor, MI when they actually used to do concerts at Crisler Center (where the University of Michigan plays basketball). They no longer do concerts in that venue, and one of the reasons, I am told, is because the place was totally trashed after that concert!  What a great show, though.  I was just a young kid at the time, and I remember all of the hoopla surrounding Ozzy at the time, such as biting the bat, etc, that made him downright scary to me.  Throw in the midget and I was terrified!  Enjoyed every second of it, though, and this DVD is great for the memories and well worth getting for any fan of Ozzy, whether you saw the actual tour or not.<br /><br />P.S. - the terror factor wore off over the years, and "The Osbournes" show totally killed that aspect of it, but Ozzy still rocks!  I just saw him in concert again recently with Gus G. and, as always, the show was amazing!
Some info about this dvd from the Black Sabbath & Family - Archives website :<br />6-12-1982 Irvine Meadows Ampitheater, Laguna Hills, CA<br />Over The Mountain, Mr. Crowley, Crazy Train, Revelation (Mother Earth), Steal Away, Suicide Solution, Goodbye To Romance, I Don't Know, Believer, Flying High Again, Iron Man, Children Of The Grave, Paranoid.<br />One of the best Ozzy concerts of all!

This Cd reminds me more of the tragic loss of Randy Rhoades more than anything else.It was fortunate for Ozzy to find temporary guitarists Brad Gillis which shows that he can play guitar.He would have been an excellent choice but he had other plans with NightRanger. Anyway great Dvd great performance!
This is classic Ozzy at his best. I'd only heard the audio to this point. I was thrilled when I saw the dvd. A must owe for any true Ozzy fan!
i was 11 yrs old when this concert was done and didn't know what heavy metal was. but i have to submit, this concert was taken from an out of print vhs tape, given a proper remaster with audio and maybe the video. ozzy at his very best with this concert. this was before ozzy did the sweet leaf song a few performances later and those whom are hot-under-the-collar over "no sweet leaf" on this dvd? you all need to get over your stoner fixations. over the last few years ozzy has turned over a new leaf and gone straight(no drugs, alcohol or ego-trips), besides ozzy IS the godfather of all heavy metal, without him none of heavy metal would exist today, so pay homage to y(our) cultural messiah, the ozbourne family is a cultural institution unto themselves and we are all obligated to give our respect, those whom don't are false metalheads. keep in mind black sabbath gave birth to heavy metal in 1970.<br /><br />i have been a metalhead since 1985 and i am never giving it up. i have lost girl friends over my devotion to metal, which is no big thing to me. if you want to get with me ladies, keep one thing in mind...."it has got to be metal if you want to headbang with me"! and a love of european splatter films is a double bonus.
Is it still.. 1998? Where's the Blu Ray release of this amazing show? It's fairly obvious Ozzy has some type of effect on his voice to sound double tracked but it's darn effective and I wonder why he didn't use it more often..this is a buy but would be a MUST BUY for double the price on Blu Ray. How did $haron mi$$ thi$ opportunity?
only bad part not randy on guitar. stageset is killer. saw show with randy on jan 9 1982 in salt lake city. best concert i ever saw. this dvd is also killer,one of the best lineups ever.
I'll get right to the point. Brad does an admirable job on guitar considering he only had a few days get get down every song and solo before touring with the band. But it should have been Randy up there, nobody else. For anyone whose been a die hard fan since blizzard of oz or a guitar nut, it's just difficult to watch since it reminds us of losing a kind person and a total phenom of a guitar player. I remember when this show first aired on mtv, and while it was enjoyable, I was just shaking my head "no" the whole show. If Randy was in in this, it would certainly have secured his status as a true legend of the guitar, right alongside EVH. Hopefully, Sharon will make the after hours footage an official release as well.
First, this band is amazing, and the quality of sound is great. Brad Gillis (Guitar) is relentless. My only quam, is that they didn't include the songs "The Wizard" (featuring unbelievably amazing drumming by Tommy Aldridge), and "Fairies wear boots" . These were two of the best songs from this show in my opinion. I really wish they threw these two songs on the disc. You also can't help but imagine what this show would have been like with Randy Rhodes at his finest. I know someone who saw Ozzy with Randy playing guitar in Asbury Park NJ in the early 80's, and he said he forgot all about Eddie Van Halen after seeing that show.
i have had many bootlegs of this over the past 25 or more years and most of them are better quality than this, i dont know if this is official or not but its not worth your money, i gave it 2 stars for the audio alone video is crap!
This dvd is great- but it does leave me wanting more.<br />I do recommend this dvd for any Ozzy fan's library.
this is totally bogus. ozzy's vocals are overdubed. they are not even close to being what he sounds like live. the music sounds great, but then ozzy comes in with studio created vocals. i wish they would give us the real raw product.  i saw this tour, his voice was rough but it was live. in concert he can't get all the notes, but who cares, it's still great when he can't reach all the high stuff. it is done so badly sometimes he is singing one thing and you hear words that don't match with his lips.  very disapointing. ozzy don't be ashamed of your voice we love it anyway.  don't buy this for ozzy's live voice, it's a studio creation. i blame sharon
UPDATE 7/18/2012:  I made a terrible mistake when I played this the first time.  I had assumed from all the hype that DTS was the superior format but I was dead wrong.  I just played it again in Dolby 5.1 and man what a world of difference it made.  With Dolby I could really crank it up loud like usual.  For my system Dolby was so much better it put the sound rating back up to excellent from nostalgic.  Then I had to play it over again in DTS just to make sure and DTS just flat out stinks.<br /><br />In dolby 5.1 the sound is much much smoother and clearer.  Now I am ready for the beer goggles test friday night.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />My original review:<br /><br />This is fantastic!  The audio and video are not perfect but you should be damn grateful to get this historic concert as such a great price.  It is truly one of THE greatest tragedies in rock music that there is not more and better OZZY concert footage out there, especially under $75.  That makes this a great value to buy so go get it NOW!<br /><br />The sound is not perfect but it gets better as the concert progresses.  Over the Mountain was sadly short changed because it is an older recording but that is no excuse.  I have Hendrix at woodstock on dvd and the concert is blu ray quality and can be cranked up to no limit without distortion.  This concert deserved an equally good recording quality but did not get it.<br /><br />The important part is this is one of the best times for OZZY music and absent the tragic loss of Randy Rhoades it is OZZY at his best.  All the songs rank at the top of my OZZY favorites.  I am just glad OZZY was kind enough to release this concert on dvd because I wanted this music very very badly.<br /><br />I should update once the dvd is done playing and it is only half way into the concert but I just had to say BUY IT NOW!<br /><br />For those interest in the quality of my HTPC sound:<br /><br />1)  Oppo BDP-93 blu ray player<br /><br />2)  Onkyo TX-NR808 a/v upconverter in 7.2<br /><br />3)  BIC Acoustec Platinum speakers:  2 X PL-89 using Monster Cable speaker wires,  2 X PL-200 using Monster Cable THX certified cables,  PL-28 using Monster Cable speaker wires<br /><br />4)  Six Logitech Z-5500 satellite speakers<br /><br />5)  Logitech Z-906 5.1 rebuilt onto a Logitech Z-5500 subwoofer.  The Z906 uses a Monster Cable THX certified fiber optic cable on 5.1 audio pass thru from my 32" LG LH40.
I actually have not had the time to watch the video but I am a huge Ozzy fan and this is a licensed product.
That I ordered from an independant dealer somewhere in my collection and I still think it's phenominal to see it again, and I hope<br /> that they improved the picture quality on it since it's re-release, it has a castle motif as the stage set behind Ozzy and the band and<br /> the special lazers of the bat flying on the walls behind the members so it's fantastic just for those things alone. I saw Metallica open for<br /> Ozzy in Fort Worth Texas during "The Ultimate Sin Tour" just before Cliff Burton died when Metallica was touring for the Master of Puppets CD and<br /> album so I got to see Cliff just before he died in that bus accident overseas. I've never seen them since except for on the DVD's.<br />This is a rare concert. But when Metallica left the stage the crowds surged into the arena and they were hanging off the rafters, Ozzy came out sitting on a huge<br />throne that was in the shape of his face with a huge tongue flowing out of it. It was awesome. I wish they would have filmed that one.
I just purchased this video.<br />This is NOT the Speak of the Devil album.<br />Maybe the tour (1982), but the original album was recorded at The Ritz in New York.<br />Just look at the song listing!<br />I was very bummed. I have been waiting for the real concert since 5th grade.<br />This is a great video, don't get me wrong, but claiming it is the Speak of the Devil show is incorrect and misleading!!!!!!!!!!
I haven't, and won't, buy this DVD. I can only assume that this was either edited, or, as someone else suggested, is a totally different concert than the bootleg I saw. The one I saw had Ozzy hanging a little person from the upper rafters of the stage who he called "Ronnie"... This is completely tasteless. That is probably why this has never been released before. I believe the joke of a human being that he has become (Shaaaaroooon!) probably has something to do with karma.... Also, someone was asking why Ozzy doesn't use that effect on his voice where it sounds double more often. The reason is that this is impossible to do live. Unlike true artists, Ozzy records over every live album he has released so that you don't hear how crappy it really sounds.
Once upon a time I owned this great vinyl album, then I bought a cd player. One day I saw "Speak of the Devil" on CD so I bought it. I took it home and listened to it and was shocked to learn that they omitted "Sweet Leaf" from the disk. I guessed that they  wussed out to the "Say No" crowd. Well, Wikipedia says they ran into CD time restrictions and decided to omit a song. I can't believe the song is omitted from the DVD. The song is totally awesome unless you are retarded. Get the CD with Sweet Leaf and you will be happier.
Hey look, the songs are great but when I had the DVD, the sound or at least the 5.1 sucked. Only for serious collectors.
