The product arrived in excellent shape- shipped via USPS- a dying breed, but better than when it was shipped UPS.  I had to return the first one since it was damaged in shipping.  I haven't watched the DVDs yet but I assume they are all okay.  There's nothing else to review since it is a known entity and if you are a Smallville fan this is a must.  I would have gotten the complete set since I think there may be things in there that are not in here but I bought each season separately already.  Enjoy!  And Amazon- excellent customer service.
When a local blockbuster was going out of business, I was able to buy seasons one through seven from them. I was addicted and could not stop watching the episodes. I soon afterward found season eight online and a little later, season nine as well. I was long awaiting the release of season ten to see how the writers would wrap up the amazing show. I was very pleasantly surprised. It was fantastic. It was definitely a great use of some of my Christmas money.
Hi I have purchased most of the series of Smallville and have enjoyed everyone of them the last series series 10 had a problem with the 1st DVD so I emailed amazon and they sent me a new series 10 and I returned the faulty series 10 then they re-inburst me the postage I give a 10 out of 10 to Amazon for the way they handle their Company Well Done It is a pleasure doing business with them and I will continue to tell my friends how good Amazon is Thanks again. Regards Kim Dawn dalzells Husband.
I am so pleased with my order.  I am a huge Smallville fan and was pleased to finish my collection so quickly and easily.  The price was more than half that of most stores.  Package was still in plastic and brand new.  Another happy Amazon customer!
One of the weekly tv shows I made a point to watch, will always be on my favorites list. I miss the show, but can't complain because they gave us ten awesome years. Thanks Tom W. And the rest of the cast for sharing you talents with us all. Take care.
The creators of Smallville did an incredible job to tie up the season finally. I love the season and the last episode.
This last season of Smallville was great. I love all the Smallville seasons. Getting this from Amazon saved me time and money.
Well, it seems that they knew that the end was coming, but it seems that it was sooner than they wanted it to be.  I am almost finished with this season and it seems that somethings are being rushed, like Clark becoming the Clark Kent from the movies, instead of the confident person that he is.  All and all, I liked it.
What can I say.  Good conclusion for such a long running show - one of my all time favourites.  Would have liked to see more of Chloe Sullivan as she was the link with the other super heroes and Clark.  Love the later seasons with the Super Heroes.  Little disappointed with the extra's in the box set, was hoping for actors interview, more interesting behind the scenes look after for going so long it would have been nice for the fans after following the show for 10 years.
Loved it.In fact I finished watchin' Smallville sn 10 two days ago and now I want to watch it again.But I shall resist if only for a few days more,(savour the flavour).
I have nothing but love for this show. I am sorry its gone. The way they played with the DC mythos and characters was pretty cool. I wish they had found a way to bring Batman into the fold. That would have been awesome. Season 10 is awesome and worth owning. Every Superman Fan should love this show. Seasons 5-10 are the best.
It came in the mail really fast, which is nice cause it's an x-mas present, brand new! No complaints, happy client!
One of the better shows of the past decade in my opinion, just too bad it had to end :(
I have been a fan of Smallville since episode 1. This season is particularly excellent though. Smallville has brought me so much joy over its tenure, and I will miss it, but I do think that this last season and the finale in particular really saw the show off well.<br /><br />Thank you Smallville cast, crew and creators for an amazing decade of heart, hope and heroism.<br /><br />z
To me the show went from slow to fast and great, been waiting for this season to come out, I have now all of the seasons and i cant wait for this one to come out, I am tired of commercials and not being able to see the whole show. I get so into it and then bang a commercial boo. I think if you want all the shows you have do some shopping because sometimes you can find the show for cheaper if you know which store to shop at and if it  goes on sale get it, great show and it will be missed, I hope the stars do well when she go off the air<br />good luck and hope it comes soon
No matter what, Smallville had integrity. There was a specific vision in place from the beginning. Not a grand mapped out vision exactly, but an idea of a show that charted the journey of Clark Kent from naive farmboy to Superman. Slowly over the course of 10 seasons they evolved the characters and true to their word gave us Superman in the end. Through production and cast changes Smallville always told fun stories that looked great (especially for a WB/CW TV show) and were exciting.
Smallville has always been one of my faverote shows of all time. I discovered it back in 2004 when it first aired on ABC family, and has loved it ever since. With each season, we see clark getting a year closer to becoming superman, and now in season 10, we see that happen. In season 10, clark must put away his fears and deal with the darkness within before he reaches that point of becoming who he is to be.<br />  The one thing that truely stands out in season 10 from anything else is the cemistry between Clark and Lois. In the first five seasons, Clark was intrested in Lana. That was good for the time being, but I feel that Lana should have left the show after season 5, so that the Clark/Lois connection could have started eariler then it did in season 8. I hate thhat the show is ending because I feel that it will end with several cliffhangers because of the events that have already unfolded.  I don't want to give to much away but I will say that season 10 is the best season ever.<br /><br />Edit: To the ones who are wondering why he hasn't flown yet or why he isn't wearing the suit. You must remember that the story follows clark kent BEFORE he's superman. His flying and wearing the suit happens after he becomes superman.
I have been a fan of Smallville since it premiered back in 2001 and I knew there will be a day when the show will end and unfortunately it has come and gone. However, thanks to DVD, I can always "Hold onto Smallville" by watching these DVDs and re-live and cherish the final season of the show for the rest of my life. Smallville fans, I highly recommend that you buy it to complete your Smallville set.
Though it lagged in some episodes, Smallville in its whole is representative of nearly 80 years of testament to the human spirit. Equality, government, immigration, sharing of knowledge and technology - you name it, it has graced Superman-based anything through the character's life. Smallville was to be the story that was never told - what happened to change Clark Kent to the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Despite episodic lag, Smallville grew into a heavy head of steam during seasons eight and nine. And we knew what it was leading up to: allowing us to believe a man can fly.<br /><br />The only negative in the climatic Season Ten is when Clark dons the suit. We never get a good look, the character is far away in the distant frame, et al. The DC purist in me wants to give it Five Stars for accomplishing exactly what it set out to do, and the fact that by the by they did it well. Maybe the intent was for us to see Superman's initial appearances as the John Q. on the streets of Metropolis - faintly, a blur of colour, from a distance safe enough for a mortal to be generally assured survival without the rendering of aid. If that indeed was the intent (and no special features I've seen testify to that point), then bravo!<br /><br />But the fanboy in me wanted to see something epic. Something worthy of a ten year old promise. The producers knew exactly where they were going to end up: Clark in the Suit. There was never any doubt. Quite simply, I was expecting something Super.<br /><br />So please, do not take a mid-grade biased heavily by the series finale at face value. The series as a whole definitively averages four stars per episode, and Season Ten is inclusive to that.<br /><br />The special features of this final season are on par with everything we've seen included so far: random commentary, occasional featurettes, and the like. But you didn't buy this DVD set for the extras. You bought it to see a man fly.<br /><br />And at that, we almost do.
I just ordered Smallville season 10 and Thought is was a good deal at $20.99, however i realized after I ordered that best buy has it for $14.99 with free shipping this week. I wish I would have checked out their site first, I could have saved 6.00. Amazon usually has the best price. Would be great if they refunded me the difference but I doubt they will. I loved Smallville and the whole series was entertaining. Season 10 was a decent ending to a great show. Too bad they wouldn't come up with a Justice League series with all the super heroes that were on Smallville.
Perhaps this might help should you be considering acquiring the Blu-ray release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L77GGA">Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray</a>] in addition to or in lieu of purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XWLN20">Smallville: The Complete Series</a>.  Both of my orders arrived in the same box from Amazon an hour ago and I performed a quick A-B comparison of the opening scene from the last episode "Finale" in addition to the 3 special features included as part of the Season 10 release to determine the amount of difference both visually and sonically.<br /><br />Having watched the original CW broadcasts in HD, the Blu-ray version is far superior viewing experience.  This is particularly evident in the medium and wider master shots, black level detail (crushes more on the DVD's) with a much more expansive sound stage (5.1 DTS HD Master Audio on the Blu-rays verses 5.1 Dobly Digital on the DVD's) offering much more enveloping atmospherics with cleaner, more distinct vocals.  By comparison, in addition to the expected lower picture resolution, the sound field is much more biased to the front sound stage with voices recorded at a lower comparable volume level sounding slightly compressed on the DVD's verses the Blu-ray's.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XWLN20">Smallville: The Complete Series</a> ultimately is a very impressive series package featuring exceptionally well done content (will take some time to read all 16 pages of the Daily Planet) that I already feel was well worth the money even if I haven't yet had the time to view any of it yet.  I understand Warner's decision concerning the reasons why this was not released on Blu-ray.  As you view the special features (especially the one on the 200th episode "Homecoming"), the difference between the clips from most recent shows along with the interviews shot for the Season 10 Special Features (10801/24p except the music video & deleted scenes which are 480i/60) when it jumps to scenes from the earlier years is quiet distinct visually.  The latter lacks sharpest, color clarity/depth even on Blu-ray.<br /><br />If one were to use Star Trek-The Next Generation as a gauge for a studio going back (18 years in 2012 since it ended in 1994!) and investing the money to re-comp all of the special effects to bring it up to the level of Blu-ray, will I still be around or care in 2029.  If you've been a dedicated fan of Smallville whether recently such as myself or from the very beginning in 2001, either the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L77GGA">Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray</a>] or the complete series should satisfy.  While the ultimate value choice is for each to make, I have no regrets completing my collection even if 5 of the seasons were double dipped as the extras on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XWLN20">Smallville: The Complete Series</a> appear to be exceptionally well worth the money spent.
the final season of smallville was an excellent tribute to the series as a whole. bringing back tons of favorites for its conclusion. each episode really pushed Clark into becoming Superman.<br /><br />I only have 2 problems with it: the entire season the writers pushed a lex clone storyline, hinting that lex would evolve into rosenbaum by the finale. even going so far as to have previous actors who played lex at younger stages return. to show the full view of lex from beginning to end, only to have this lex clone turn into superboy at the end. what seemed like such a main street idea took a left turn and not for the better. so when rosenbaum returned it wasnt clear if he was a clone, or the original resurrected by darkseid. because they literally hinted at both. Also, we never see Tom Welling as Superman. After ten years and all the teases, Tom nevers wears the suit to display that he has become Superman. They dont even call him Superman! They went so far as to make sure you didnt see tom as superman by making ridiculously far or close shots. the ending was near perfect.<br /><br />Almost perfect. Almost.
For the last ten years we watched Clark Kent, becoming boy to a world's legend.  In the show, we made a promise that their would be no flight and no tights.  For the last season, Clark Kent is ready to wear the tights and fly.  He's been through a lot of obstacles that will help him become the greatest superhero for a long time and that will make him a legend.  We watched Clark Kent develop the seven major powers for ten years, the strenghth, the speed, the x-ray, the heat, super-hearing, leaping, Super-breath and flight.  Seeing the finale where Clark Kent wearing the superman suit and flying made it look like he was ready to fulfil his destiny.  We knew he was ready, but Clark Kent himself knew when he was ready to take on the mantle.  He was ready for it to fulfil destiny and wear the superman suit.  Trust me this is how a boy becomes superman.
I am a huge superman fan. I am a huge smallville fan. I can't put into words how happy this season made me so if you liked the previous 9 you would have to be outside your mind to not watch this. watch it. do it. doooooo it. THANK YOU SMALLVILLE FOR 10 AMAZING SEASONS!
I'm going to miss new Smallville episodes. All I know for sure though is that I'm glad the show went out with a bang.
Tom welling punked out! they should have let us see the superman suit on him, we waited ten years for this one moment. great show! now for ten years as superman. lets get the next superman series rolling with tom welling.
The tenth and final season of "Smallville" features some outstanding shows such as the premiere episode, "Lazarus" and the series' 200th episode, "Homecoming." Of course the march to the finale kept fans tuning in week after week. I have watched the show for years and enjoyed it although I realized it was uneven at times and didn't always pay off. To me, the final show, "Finale" is a perfect example of this. A lot of season ten was spent on Clark and Lois Lane's relationship and plans for the wedding. The first hour of the finale focused on the wedding and then, guess what? No wedding! It may happen seven years from now! What??!! Then, we were teased with the Superman suit in the first episode and other shows including the next-to-last show. Did they pay that off? No, of course not! Welling never dons the suit. We get a CGI Superman flying and a rip of his shirt revealing the Superman logo for the final shot. Even an extreme close-up of Welling with a CGI cape billowing behind him. Again, what the heck??!! I really had faith that writers Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders would come through. Now I am left with a disappointment with the series due to the finale and Tom not flying with the suit on. The pay-offs were lacking. We did get a great scene of Jonathan handing the suit to Clark (for what good that did!) and a great shot of Clark flying out of the fortress and I liked the shot too when Lois saw him flying outside the plane. But I had hoped to smile when I think of the finale and I don't. I did like the scene when Jonathan and Martha and Clark all embrace in the barn as Apocalypse is heading toward earth. One can only hope that maybe a reunion movie will be made some day and Tom Welling, realizing how disappointed many fans were, will actually no longer fear to put the suit on. I will buy this season but with a mixed bag of emotions.
As an avid Smallville fan - this series doesn't disappoint. Though it has been long and drawn out out for "Superman" to appear - the background stories have been very well written and only a couple of episodes out of the 23 are "not up to scratch".<br /><br />Cant wait for Series 10!
As in seasons eight and nine of "Smallville", this tenth season will appeal to fans of the "comic action-adventure" variety.  Those looking for solid writing, richly developed characters, and legitimate, non-predictable "wow" moments have likely trickled off after seasons 5-6.  I have been with the series for the long haul and, while thoroughly enjoying the first 5 seasons, liking 6-7, and despising 8-9, I cannot give the final season good reviews based on nostalgia perpetuated by the show's ending.<br /><br />There are a few basic plotlines that run throughout this final season, all of which fall flat in one way or another:<br /><br />-The U.S. government's reaction to superheroes: an almost blatant rip-off of many themes from "The Dark Knight".<br /><br />-The Clark/Lois relationship: Should work, but (as writers) you can't have Lois be EASILY the most annoying character on the show for six seasons and then expect us to put all that aside and love her in the seventh.<br /><br />-Clark Kent coming to terms with the hero he is destined to become: Pretty much every decision/conclusion Clark comes to this season in terms of embracing his destiny is watered-down due to botched attempts in previous seasons.  Because the show was on a year-to-year basis for so long, the frequent stops-and-starts in Clark's transition to Superman rendered that penultimate transition without much drama.<br /><br />Really, there are only three things that I enjoyed about this season (aka the reason I can give it 2 stars instead of just 1):<br /><br />-The "Earth 2" plot arc, which allowed us to see some characters that hadn't been around for awhile.  The alter-universe characters kind of muddy things up in the end, but it is nice to see them as "themselves" once again.<br /><br />-The episode "Homecoming", where the Smallville writers give a not-so-subtle nod of acceptance to fans like me who became disenchanted after the season five episode "Reckoning" and the slow bleed that followed.<br /><br />-The "Finale" episode, where us long-surviving fans finally get the payoff that we've all been waiting for.<br /><br />Thus, it basically comes down to this: If you loved "Smallville" in the early goings and feel it has declined since "Reckoning", this season won't change that opinion whatsoever.  However, if you still got enjoyment out of the later seasons, you'll probably like this one too.
Let me start off by saying when for the first four seasons, Smallville was my favorite show. It was still in my top five until season 8. And to my surprise, I still liked it after Lex left. But by season 9, it had run out of steam... and they just kept right on going. And that gets my goat a little. Most of this season seems like filler for the finale. I watched this season to see Clark become Superman. But that last episode is mostly Lois and Clark deciding if they are going to get married or not. Like some cheesy romance show. It's like they forgot who the original audience for the show was - largely young males. Then, to top it off, you don't even really get a good look at Welling as Superman. I personally felt robbed. I think the original integrity of the show was sacrificed in this so-so season.<br /><br />On the plus side, though, It looks and sound great. The 1080p transfer looks better than a lot of TV shows I've seen on Blu Ray.<br /><br />Welling and the other producers just should have known when to quit.
The end lives us with the expectation that the stories will transform into "SMALLVILE THE KENT'S",  and a real good chance of a more realistic  superman when it comes to manage the transition.
The blu-ray has a great image quality, in a compact casing. The holding of the disc is firm, yet easy to remove, not requiring lots of disc bending while trying to do that.<br /><br />Can't judge the episodes itself, as only my sister has seen them
like i said before is better when the images appears that words in fiding the episodes  was to difficult for me i have to ckeck all the episodes to find the rigth one, thats why the images you go right to the correct one.
This was awesome! So sad it is not continuing.  The special effects were outstanding and the plot was right on target.
Just thrilled the heart of a 12 yr. old. Was the best gift she received for her birthday. Loved it
Enjoyed watching the Final Season despite not seeing the entire seasons since Season 5.  Loved the wedding and the finale!
I'm on the second disk now, and the third episode does not play on my xbox 360, on my TV's DVD player it skips constantly, however, it does play on my PS3. Not really sure why, it is not the blue ray version so there is really no excuse for the dvd to only play on certain devices.
THE TENTH SEASON WAS ALL I EXPECTED AND MUCH MORE. THERE WAS PLENTY OF FEEDBACK ON THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND THE PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUND WAS OUTSTANDING. HOWEVER ONE OF MY DVDS IN THE SET DOES NOT WORK, A VERY DISAPPOINTING OPTION FOR ME. IT WAS THE LAST TWO PROGRAMS ON THE DISC. WHICH IS FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE SEASON FINALE ONE LAST TIME. I HOPE THEY CAN FIX THIS OR AT LEAST REPLACE THE DISC. OTHER THEN THAT IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND TIME WAITING FOR THE ITEM. I WILL CONTINUE WITH AMAZON.COM AS THEY ARE VERY FAIR WITH ALL THE ITEMS I HAVE BOUGHT OVER THE YEARS.
While many fans of the show have shown mixed feelings about the finale after thinking about the entire series from begging to end while it wasn't what many were expecting and while it lets us down a little the finale still was pretty appropriate for the series in general.  If you've seen the show from the first season then this is a must have for any completest fan,  I'm a little sad the see the show finally over but after a long run of ten years the producers and creators have the right to be very proud of the shows success to stay on the air that long.  So for fans of the Superman universe here's comes a great set for us to enjoy and lament a little of a show we knew as Smallville...
The final season of "Smallville" has been really awesome! Love everything about this show, especially Tom Welling and Erica Durance's portrayal of the iconic duo, Lois and Clark.<br /><br />I hate to see "Smallville" end, but I'm really looking forward to the final episode, the beginning of Superman's journey.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L77GG0">Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season</a><br /><br />Yeh but does the blue boy fly in this season. Nine seasons of watching a remake of The Flash. Great stories and characters but I want to see the kid spread his wings and go for broke. I want to see the excellent flying sequences of the last movie version. I want that 'Up, Up and Away' (ex Radio and 1940's serial versions). I know I'm being quite super ficial but Superman is the guy who flies...that's his job. Batman runs, Green Hornet runs, The Flash runs but sup baby flies, its in the rules. Here in Oz season 10 is still en route (obviously not airmail) so I want to buy this item but I also want the 'Look up in the sky. Its a bird, its a plane..no its...well you know the rest. If he flies I give this season 5 stars, 4 if he doesnt.
Why does this get released on November 29th? They usually release Smallville in September, if someone can tell me why I would greatly appreciate it. However Samllville was one of the best shows on television along with Supernatural, Psych, and Mad Men in my opinion. As a Superman collector for years and years I was very happy that this show was able to wrap things up without being cut short. Smallville quite frankly means a lot to me and I refuse to believe that one season was better than another, it's a very large character arc and some lulls are to be expected when a character is developed from beginning to end (or at least the end of that particular chapter of development). Even after Michael Rosenbaum left the show after season seven they didn't panic, they still worked hard and gave it's audience something worth their time.<br /><br />The only thing I wish they had done and I know that it was impossible but I would have loved to have seen it at least once would have been Clark meeting a young Bruce Wayne. I just think that would have been really really awesome, but it wasn't possible and I'm not sure it would have worked in the plot line. Tom Welling will forever be my envisionment of Superman/Clark Kent and he even without being a hardcore fan of the Superman mythos just continually knocked it out of the park episode after episode. I would just like to say thanks to him for being awesome.<br /><br />The real reason you would want to buy this is simply to finish your consumption of an epic story, a transformation from man to legend, from hero to superhero. I wasn't sure how they were going to tie up everything after ten years worth of plot to integrate into two hours but they succeeded in grandiose fashion and I wasn't even slightly disappointed. A very heartfelt thank you to everyone associated with the show, on my end it has been a very fun ride and this show will be sorely missed.
There were some problems in the wrapping up of the series, but still this season<br />was better than whole Doomsday arc they had prior.<br /><br />I have a few complaints though.  I'll be a bit vague to prevent spoiling anything.<br /><br />1) I have no idea what the heck was going on with Alison Mack.  They kept putting<br />her in and taking her out of the credits which would be fine if they did that with<br />all involved, but seems to be short changing her by not having her properly there<br />every time.<br /><br />2) Kristin Kreuk only appear via flash back.<br /><br />3) The solutions for Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen are lame.<br /><br />4) The mirror box arc was mostly good, but some of the Dark Seid solutions, not so much.<br /><br />I'd say that overall it was good enough, but I felt there was enough missing to make it<br />not as satisfying as I hoped.
As a long-time Smallville fan, the last season wrap-up of this decade long series is somewhat disappointing. A few stand-out episodes pepper the season early on and Erica Durance's Lois Lane charms us through and through.  However, fans who loyally waited for Clark to get the suit and finally fly under the colors of his heroic destiny will be sorely disappointed.  The obvious "blue-screen" effects and the fact that Clark was in costume for what was probably less than 8 minutes at the end of the final episode suggest that the creators of the series begrudgingly gave fans what they were clamoring for -- and only at the last moment.  Other plot and character inconsistencies abound. The last season has a few golden moments, but they're planted like Easter egg gifts among an otherwise limited vision of one of our most enduring American heroes.
Okay, this is it, my final review of Smallville for Season 10.  The ending of the show had its high points and low points, lets run down the episodes!<br /><br />1. Lazurs.....In great Smallville fashion. A great opening........to the season, some incredible moments with Lex showing up (NOT Michael Rosenbaum) at least not yet<br /><br />2.  Shield...........Hated the new character of Cat Grant......made this episode unwatchable.  But a little interesting storyline with Lois and Carter in Egypt<br /><br />3. SUpergirl.........Kara returns,  good episode for the season<br /><br />4. Homecoming.......Probably the best episode of the whole season,  A look into Clarks future,  Brainiac returns!<br /><br />5. Isis........DID NOT LIKE IT!<br /><br />6.  Harvest.........DID NOT LIKE IT!........but be sure to watch the Tess/Alexandar storyline........very powerful<br /><br />7.  Ambush.......The Lanes are back together.......2 words....MICHAEL Ironside.....and keep ur eye open for Teri Hatcher<br /><br />8.  Abanonded.....great episode.....we learn that much more about Tess.....does she have a relationship with somebody?<br /><br />9.  Patriot.......oh god, Aquman returns...LAME<br /><br />10. Luthor.......YES LIONEL Luthor returns,  AWESOME<br /><br />11.  Icarus........decent episode,  a character dies.<br /><br />12.  Collaterl.....What is Chloe up to.  Great episode<br /><br />13. Beacon.......Good episode,  Martha Kent is back<br /><br />14. Masquerade.......I thought it was a rather boring episode.<br /><br />15. Fortune.....Funny episode.....The whole crew wakes up from a "hangover"<br /><br />16. Scion.......good episode.....So is Alexandar good or bad?<br /><br />17. Kent........great episode.....What? Jonathan Kent is back??<br /><br />18.  Booster.....not one of my favs<br /><br />19. Dominon....Clark and Oliver are back in the PHantom Zone.  GREAT EPISODE!<br /><br />20.  Propechy.....The build up to the FINAL episode.....What is happening to Oliver??<br /><br />21.  THE FINAL EPISODE.........Could have been better, it was good but not great.  Dont really get a clear shot of Clark flying or in the suit....Michael Rosenbaum returns,  but it didnt do anything for me<br /><br />All in all, it was a great SHOW!  But the final episode, could have been so much stronger!
My favorite episodes of Smallville were when they introduced other superhero characters.  So I LOVED the beginning part of this season where they had a bunch of different superheroes.  But at the end?  Clark adopts "superboy" and when Clark disappears for 3 weeks, no mention of Superboy.  The same with the Wedding (that did not happen).  No superheros show up to see their best friend get married?  Come on?  What a let down.  As for budgeting, the budgeting constraints were very obvious in the 2nd half of this season.  Very low budget.  If you watched this show all of the way through, you are going to buy the tenth season no matter what.  For me, from what was being said at the beginning of the season, and the quality of the first half of the tenth season, I was disappointed in the second half of the tenth season.
This series is the best series if you want to see how superman grew up and how the Justice League of America came about.  This series keeps all the movies, the comics and the series with George Reeves, in check.  The only complaint that I have with the series is that they bought Lois Lane in the series too soon.  Remember, Clark only got to know Lois when he left Smallville and went to Metropolis to work for the Daily Planet.  Other than that, that is the only complaint/negative complaint that I have with the show.  So sit back and enjoy the show and even this is the last season for the show, hopefully it will the best season ever and leave an opening for The New Adventures of Superman!!!  Who knows!  Enjoy the show.  Best of lick to this winning series.
final season was so- so. the best seasons was 1-7, than after that was so-so, and smallville didn't go out on a high note
I just saw the last two episodes of Smallville they mostly talked threw the hole show there were no real fight scene's and to top it off we really didn't see  him in his superman close's and if we did it was from far away. I think they could have done a better job for the last episode they were suppose to have darkside on there and trust me dark side looks nothing like what they had on the show he really didn't even fight superman. They only showed Green Arrow for like 15 seconds then the talking part was like 30 minutes I seen better Superman stuff then what they did, Superman Returns and Justice League did way better job's then that, Im sorry I watch Smallville for a long time but the episode was not that good, for any show to have a last episode it dosen't matter if its Icarly,Ben 10 or 24 you make sure the last episode is the best.
10th Season, Show 2 (September 24,2010) Sadly Zod is gone and Lois has already taken off to join Perry White in Africa to search for clues concerning the Red Queen (Martha).  Come on girl you've got the strongest, kindest and best looking guy on the planet (and beyond) and you leave? Isn't it time to deal with committment?  :) Hell-o!  Wish everyone would smile just a little bit more.  Everything has gotten so "dark"...literally.  Sometimes can't even see what is happening on screen! Maybe a little more yellow sun?  :)
I've seen every episode from Season 1-9 and own all 9 seasons. I can't wait for Season 10, even though it's the last season.
What a disappointment! Writers block supreme! they resurrected every villain, acquaintance, and relative of Clarks. They made him face and defeat every one he ever fought and then killed them off again. So many flashbacks the viewer often lost sight of what was actually going on.  More alternate dimensions, got sent back to the phantom zone, the Luthers, on again off again weddings, and any other trite cliche you can think of. Barely watchable and certainly not worth the price.
The show worked at its core when Jonathan Kent was still on and you had father and son moments. The dynamic of him with his parents made the show like you'd expect an early start of Clark's life to be. Somehow by season 10, they got wayyyyyy off track! The whole blue blur crap, and Clark looking like the only idiot alien who is afraid to fly... It just got bad.<br /><br />The finale was pretty pathetic in that you don't see him in the full suit. They just cgi (and bad cgi) him into a crappy costume that you get a glimpse as he helps a plane ala Reeve/Routh from the movies.<br /><br />EWWW stay away from this one folks and wait for the "Man of Steel" movie starring Henry Cavill.
I have to give the cast allot of credit pulling these stories off.The story lines have been so oddly reinterpreted from the original timelines of the Superman Comics as to be nothing short of  a distorted vision of the writers, there is much I have disliked about this series yet I have purchased every season of the series. I am a long time Comic reader and superman fan think 40 plus years so yes I know my timelines.<br /><br />My wife swears she will scream if she sees Clark walk to the rescue yet again. I am hopeful that the suit will go on and this retarded version of Superman will fly if not then I say damn the writers and producers for stringing this out for so long just to end the series with a watered down poor boy superman.<br /><br />Sometimes I think I watch it just for the pain and disappointment. I know Tom Welling must be dying to fly already I mean common 10 seasons already writers knock off the bull!
Ok, this review is for the AMAZON PRICE, not the actual show... Currently the DVD set is 53.99 and the Blu-ray is 44.99.  I realize both prices are subject to change and the pre-order guarantee and such, but...  Blu-ray cheaper than DVD? That's just crazy.<br /><br />*Minor changes made to review to reflect that price can change, and to not unfairly impact the show's rating based on this review.  I love the show, I just could not justify purchasing the season from Amazon when the prices were as they were when it was released.*
This final season I place in the worst season in the ten year history of the series. If I had seen this series on television I would not have purchased the box set.
I watched Smallville off and on and here of the 10th season being there last.I bought seasons 1-9 and watched them until season 10 started,so I could catch up.Most of the early season so the same way every episode,so you probaly will get tired of watching them,like I did.Someone always gets knocked out and doesn't remember what happened the week before or the book The Art of War gets quoted alot by Lex or Lex's father and the constintly repeating scenes of conflict or make up to break up in one whole episode kinds of things get old.But season 1-9 were very fun and exciting to watched and season 9 was truly amazing with the JSA and all the other specail appearrances throughout.<br /><br />But on to season 10.A very hard season to follow or want to follow.They clearly made this season for everyone from the original cast to come back to say there final goodbyes.Which was nice,even though most of it just seemed like a flip of a switch and there they are,so if you missed even the smallest parts of the episodes.You would be completely lost and with all the people comming back made alot of the episodes for this season seemed half assed or as if they just stopped caring about the show anymore,for example,an entire episode about a very rare bow that they spend an entire episode on,ends up getting destroyed the last 5 minutes of the show or the hangover episode.<br /><br />Where everyone has to find out what happened the night before,which that episode was very lame.I also hate that that there was no main villian that has anything to do with the story at all.Just shadows of the actual person or clones or body switches instead of the clear cut villain like Lex or Zod were in the past.Darksied would just send his lackies to do most if not all his dirty work,which made him look like a giant pussy.It was like he had something better to do because it didn't seem like he got very involved in what was going on.<br /><br />It all comes down to two things.After 10 season of constint focus was on the Clark Kent's character and not Superman,but in later seasons,Clark gets called the blur,which finally starts separating the Clark/Superman "the blur" dynamic alittle.But in season 10 they just seem to cram the full change of Clark being a nerd,who can't do anything and Superman "the blur" doing all the things he can do overnight and no one noticed the huge changed and thought it wouldn't be odd,but all of the other characters must have gotten knocked out and forgotten the past 9 years of there lives.But the last,but most important,the whole flying thing.I honestly thought season 10 was finally the season where he would fly.Not on the very last episode and for a very short time on the last episode.<br /><br />To me it just seemed like they were giving the middle finger to all the superman fans,I always pictured superman being the strongest and most powerful hero out there,but in recent years in animation as well as live action,he would rather root for the Batmans or Green Arrow characters because for the least powerful characters they seem to fair alot better than Superman,who get controlled by the villian or knocked out or kidnapped or something stupid like that and in live action does extremely well only not do extremely badly later on.
First let me start by saying I loved Smallville. I watched my first episode in 2007 and quickly caught up with the previous episodes and currently own seasons 1-9. I loved that the writers tried to be as balanced and fair as possible. I also loved the energy of the show!<br /><br />I missed the first two episodes, but made sure to catch Homecoming. I couldn't believe the direction the show was talking with its not-so subtle jabs at "embracing illegal immigrants"  I was surprised, because the same sort of comment had been made in the previous episode too. Wasn't it Lois who said in season six, "does breaking and entering not mean anything to rich people?" But the message seemed to be that it's okay to enter another country as long as it's done by a someone living in poverty- then you don't need to follow the rules. I didn't like the overall disrespect that the military was given in this season. They were portrayed as villains' and I expected more balance.<br /><br />I also expected a stronger story. I think the thing writers and producers of comics need to remember is that in fantasy/sci-fi a hero is only as credible as the villain. Replacing strong villains' like Doomsday, Zod, and Lex with a boorish, contrived and ghost-like character that preys on people like some evil little devil sitting on their shoulder is childish and insulting to the viewer.  There were also a few sloppy episodes that made me cringe. A bachelor party themed episode where they wake up and don't know what happened? It was so hard to watch them act drunk, and what was worse was the lines seemed like they were being made up as the actors went along.<br /><br />Again, I would just urge people to think twice before purchasing this season. I'm glad I saw the epiodes I did, because I will not be buying this propaganda soap box season and the political bru ha ha that took away from the really genuine and beautiful relationship that Lois and Clark were finally able to have.<br /><br />I would also love to see how that relationship ended, but the constant insinuation that only a corrupt individual would ask people to enter a country legally was just too much. My Grandmother came to this country legally at time when her country was at war and everyone was starving, yet she still managed to enter the US by abiding all laws. To suggest that its' okay to just enter a country, because "they only want the opportunities that you and your family have" (As Oliver's lines stated) is a slap in the face to all those who respected the laws of their future country.
What the hell??  The show doesn't start til this Friday.  I'm sure this season will be epic.  Based on the teasers seen on TV, looks like Clark will become Superman.  But what is up with that photo.  That has to be photoshopped.  Look how huge Clark's hand is and the direction his arm is heading.  just looks weird.  Totally looking forward to this season.  But seriously Amazon...pre order already???
I used to like watching this series early on, when it had stories in it, before the endless sad futility of the Lana Lang romance wore me out... Thought I'd give this last season a try, see if it all came to anything. And what I found was a travesty. Whole episodes seem to consist of characters pretentiously declaiming abstract profundities like, "In order to live in the present, I need to let go of the past, dad. That means I have to say goodbye to you." It seems as if the whole story is taking place on some level of vapid commentary. They forgot to invent action - actual plotlines - that would convey these trite messages and make them fresh. It's like a clinic in what Henry James said not to do when he advised authors to show, not tell. The finale goes even farther, with Clark realizing that he shouldn't have let go of the past after all, because although his strength comes from Krypton, his heroic traits come from the Kent family farm. Only this message isn't dramatized -- nothing happens that would make the viewer realize it as lived truth -- instead it is rammed down our throats in the form of...words. We don't need characters saying things like,"A hero can only be as strong as his enemies, so that's why I, Lex Luthor, am here." That is supposed to be the job of commentators and critics, who unearth such insights from a good story. But these modern protagonists insist on bloviating about their own significance. The rest of the story is either really bad science fiction or really generic soap opera, and the performances are the same. Some talented actors are dragged down by the lines they must speak. The splendid Erica Durance is turned into a sappy one-dimensional poster girl for faithfulness and fairy tale marriage; the mischievous Alison Mack barely rises above her Spielberg-like bedtime story scene; and it's hard to tell if Tom Welling can act, but he comes off as irretrievably stiff and not too bright, and doesn't look facially anything like any Superman we've ever seen in comics. If you like watching people make speeches about the deep meaning of life instead of embodying it, you'll love Smallville Season 10. All moral, no story.
The best season ever. The show is just fantastic. Long live the best TV show ever.
It's official, Smallville butchered Superman.<br />The series stuck to its original goal of preventing Clark from becoming the Man of Steel for as long as possible. And when he finally does change, the scene are the worst Superman scenes to be filmed. There's only two maybe three shots of Tom Welling in the suit and the rest of the time Superman is shown in a far away shot done with incredibly poor computer animation.<br />The series decided to do its own version of Superman saving an airplane and its absolutely pathetic. The film Superman Returns has a far superior scene and it even won several awards for it. But that's because that film was actually done by Superman fans and by people who had actually read the comics. Smallville clearly isn't done by Superman fans and they maybe have read about ten issues, and obviously hated them. Hence the reason why Smallville stays away from Superman for so long and doesn't even give the characters their original names.<br />The Blur? Velocity? What stupid names to give Superman and The Flash.<br />Now what really is awful about the finale is how it ends. Lex is barely in it, and maybe the actor had two, three days of filming. (but more than likely just one.) And Clark doesn't even fight Lex or Darkside. I was at least expecting a fight scene between the those two once Clark became Superman, but no he just moves the fire ball away in the last ten minutes of an hour and half show. The whole episode is horrible and boring because most of it is Clark and Lois complaining about getting married and complaining about their futures. Boring!<br />Now if people really want to see a good version of Superman, check out the animated films from DC Animated Warner Studios. Those films are marvelous, stay true to the comics, get PG-13 ratings because of all the action, and they show why cartoons are the best way to deliver comic books as movies. Live action films are just horrid, cartoons, that's where it's at.
After not watching smallville for a while I decided it was time to start up again. Needless to say I was disappointed. Lois is some undercover superhero that goes from a chauffer to a stripper and amazingly (not!) she knew her way around a club she had NEVER been to, stole a costume, managed to find a wig and ta da she was seducing the bad guy. They made the Lois character with too big of a head, Clark is too much a wimp to amount to much. Smallville has gone way down with the addition of Lois and her character.<br /><br />I am curious if this will survive after season 10....
I'm not someone that knows the Superman mythos.  I'm not familiar with all the DC Comics characters.  I did watch a couple of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies as a child and so I know the basics of Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Lex Luthor, but other than that...I know nothing.  And I'm glad because I think this is what makes it easier for me to enjoy ALL of Smallville.  I had no expectations and thus I was not disappointed in the overall story of Smallville. The story that I was always interested in was, of course, Clark Kent.  Let's face it...this story is about him and how he deals with life and with his destiny.  That's it...and to see him struggle with it all was refreshing to see, at least to me.  He wasn't this perfect being that knew where his place in "history" was...he had to figure it out which is where all the drama of Smallville began...Clark "dealing" with life...which included over protective parents, a first love (Lana Lang) who could never quite trust him, a friend (Lex Luthor) that became a life long enemy, a sidekick (Chloe) that was the best friend he could have ever had but who also lost a little bit of faith in him, a fellow superhero (Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow) that tested his morality and always fell short, and last but not least...my favorite...Lois Lane...the unlikeliest person for him to fall in love with but who believed in him...or in Smallville storyland...the Blur...more than anyone else did...even Chloe.  That's why in this Smallville version, Clark tells Lois...you were always the one that I needed.  Her complete trust in what he represented is what he needed in this story to meet his destiny.  This may not be IAW the Superman mythos, but it's darn good storytelling and I have loved every minute of it.  I will be sad to see the series end because I could watch Lois and Clark played by Erica Durance and Tom Welling, banter back and forth and save the world for many, many more years to come.  There are few series in TV land today that match the storytelling of this series.  Thank you Smallville for some many great stories that I will continue to watch over and over again.
MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The tenth season of "Smallville" is a tremendous ride to a stirring final episode.  It is a great sendoff overall for what is arguably the finest television series of its entire genre.<br /><br />Beginning with "Lazarus," the season propels Clark on a fantastic journey. Pulled back from death in the season premiere by Lois Lane, the love of his life, Clark must face a freakishly cloned Lex Luthor, played extremely well in the premiere by Mackenzie Gray.  Additionally, Clark must contend with the knowledge that an evil supernatural being known as Darkseid threatens to dominate the Earth.  John Schneider also returns in the first episode as Johnathan Kent, Clark's departed Earthly father, now a spirit guide for him.<br /><br />The season's second episode "Shield," is an important show for the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller's corrupt fighting force.  The group of radically violent superhero supporters comes to the forefront as the primary villains in the early half of the season.  The show also introduces the "Smallville" iteration of Cat Grant, a latter-day "Superman" character whom I first became familiar with through "Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman."  Played by actress Keri Lynn Pratt, she is fairly annoying but essentially has good intentions.<br /><br />This season also features the series' landmark 200th episode, an absolute gem called "Homecoming."  The return of James Marsters as Brainiac 5 heralds a stunning trip through time for Clark.  An important component of emotional peace and closure regarding Johnathan's death finally gives Clark a mature philosophical base for true love with Lois Lane.  Unfortunately, the very next episode "Isis" is one of the few true low points of the season, a head-scratching show whose storyline is random and pointless.  It mostly exists to drag a fringe superhero into the show but does have a moment of redemption at its conclusion.<br /><br />When "Smallville" premiered in 2001, its premise and promise was the journey of the hero Clark Kent and the future villain Lex Luthor.  As with any long-running TV series, cast members gradually left "Smallville," even including the show's original mature Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum.  To the immense credit of the series' creative staff, the overall story arc was wisely altered slightly, to both keep the name Lex Luthor viable in the series and make room for a charismatic female antihero named Tess Mercer.  Cassidy Freeman contributes depth and ultimately compassion as a multifaceted actress, and has a very rich character arc in the final season.  Lex Luthor is kept viable this season through a series of clones, ironically at first nurtured in secret by Tess.  I can forgive an absurd contrivance to bring the deceased Lionel Luthor back to life in the episode "Luthor."  The show is one of the best of the season, and John Glover's devilishly cold acting approach to Lionel Luthor is, technically speaking, the work of a master.<br /><br />Episode highlights are "Homecoming," "Ambush," "Abandoned," "Icarus," "Shield," "Patriot," "Lazarus," and the series finale, a two-hour masterpiece entitled simply "Finale."<br /><br />The finale is a thoughtful romp through ten years of series backstory, thematically exploring the character of Clark Kent in its first half and revealing the character of Superman in its second half.  The Darkseid storyline comes to a gruesome head and original series stars Tom Welling and Michael Rosenbaum fulfill the series' intial promise.  A brilliant storytelling balance highlighting the marriage of Clark and Lois and the full emergence of Superman juxtaposed against a monstrous dark turn for both Lionel and Lex sets the perfect tone for the series' conclusion.<br /><br />I love "Smallville."  Over its time on the air, it has become one of my favorite television shows of all time.  Thank you to the cast and crew through all ten years, and to original series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.  This is a truly brilliant show.
I've been watching Smallville since it's premier on October 16th 2001. Lets be honest folks, this series started out so strong, it just wasn't really Superman like... in the beginning. That doesn't make it bad tho, it all comes together in due time. Character development on this show has been superior to most other shows. I put the characterization level to Joss Whedon's Buffy: Anya and Cordelia (through Angel) who have been 2 of the most fleshed out characters in my television watching history. Each character on this show has his or her own place, and their development is top notch. The show finally develops into what it will become in season 4 and the introduction of Lois Lane. Smokin hot Erica Durance!!!! Her chemistry with Tom Welling has been undeniable since she first found him in that field. Unfortunately (And fortunately) Season 7 brought about the end of creators Al Gough and Miles Millar's run on the series! This is bad, as they are fantastic with what they do, and how they kept the pace of the show. Also bad because season 8 Smallville is by far the weakest season under the Smallville belt. It felt pushed, the acting was slippery and the plot had more holes than a 5lb chunk of Swiss Cheese... The Doomsday fight alone was cringe-worthy enough to nearly destroy the entire show, that is until season 9 kicks off... Which is when all the GOOD starts happening despite Gough and Millar's exit. Once the new producers (maybe new writers?) found their groove, they grooved all the way to the bank.... Season 9 exploded into my favorite season of the show. With so many guest stars and new characters... Season 9 looked to be the best, and then..... SEASON 10 has been blowing my mind. The progression that we've all been waiting for has finally arrived... The show has hit it's stride, and it's so incredibly unfortunate (not to say I don't understand) that with S10, we will be rid of Smallville, and that my friends is a melancholy moment, but I'm sure glad they are going out with a bang! If you haven't seen any Season 10 yet... just you wait, it's tops! As a series... it's one of my all time favorites along with Buffy, Angel, Desperate Housewives and Brothers & Sisters. I find it hard to put these 5 shows in any kind of order, they are all fantastic!
This review is more for season 10 itself.  I think after nine seasons, after starting off in one place and really taking the series (and its characters) to places fans probably never thought it/they would go, expectations for the tenth season were undoubtedly sky high and in my opinion that's why a lot of people have given some negative reviews about some parts of the season.  The only episode I allowed myself to have any real expectation for was "Finale."  I've been through this before; The seventh season of 'Charmed' and a good portion of season eight was fantastic, but my expectations to tie up so many loose ends that final season let me down.  Same with Buffy and Angel ... So I promised myself I would not create any expectations in my mind of what the final season should be.  I approached it like it was not the final season.<br /><br />Doing that allowed me to enjoy each episode (some were not as good, admittedly, but every season of every show has its weaker episodes).  I'll give the writers and producers (and especially the cast) credit; they really do CRAM A LOT in these twenty-one episodes ("Finale" is two hours).  Annette O'Toole and John Schneider (Martha and Jonathan Kent) make touching returns; John Glover's return is absolutely chilling as he reinvents Lionel as a nemesis, not the soft(er)-hearted sometimes-villain he had become prior to falling to his death at the end of the seventh season.  James Marsters rocked as Brainiac 5, and Laura Vandervoort's episode, though one of the weaker of the season, showed a Kara that had grown since we'd seen her last.  Callum Blue's return as Zod (who know ruled the Phantom Zone) was one of my favorites.  Appearances in "Finale" by Michael Rosenbaum (always fabulous as Lex Luthor) and Aaron Ashmore as the real Jimmy Olson.  Most of all I was happy Allison Mack came back for six episodes, book-ending the season with Chloe sacrificing herself to save Oliver and playing a solid role in the finale, as it should have been.  I'll admit I was a bit ticked that Mack did not sign on as a regular for the full season, especially considering she was lasted longer than any other cast member on the show (except Tom Welling, of course), but ultimately I think it was fitting.  After years of taking a back seat to Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang, Mack really proved her worth during seasons eight and nine as the show's female lead.  Chloe Sullivan had more real character development in those two seasons than seasons five, six, and seven combined.  It was fitting, though, that she step aside and hand the role of female lead to Erica Durance (the best Lois Lane ever, in my opinion) for the final season.  Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen) and Cassidy Freeman (Tess Mercer) were brilliant in their roles; Freeman really rocked this season and held her own in a scenes with with Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover.<br /><br />Though seasons eight and nine are my favorite, season ten is awesome and I highly recommend it.
Let me start off by saying that I have been a DIEHARD Smallville fan since its inception in 2001. Although I have thoroughly enjoyed each season, season 10 is definitely the weakest of the series.  One of the problems of this season is that they take DC's greatest villain Darkseid and reduce him to a "smokey" afterthought. Smallville has always done a great job of integrating villains from the comics and putting their own little twist on it to fit a CW budget but Darkseid fails to make the cut considerably. Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Zod, and even Doomsday have all been transfered from the comic book pages onto the TV screen with great results but Darkseid literary makes an appearance for like 10 seconds in a total of 22 episodes. There is so much untapped potential with the Darkseid character which ultimately makes this season disappointing. Another disappointing element to this season is the sub plot of Oliver Queen revealing his identity to the world. This contributes nothing to the overall plot arch and what makes it worse is that it was directly ripped off from the movie Iron Man. The introduction of Cat Grant leading the opposition against the superheroes is pointless as well. Her character is annoying, irritating, and contributes little to the season. They should have used the hot Cat Grant from season 8 and perhaps introduce an interesting little love triangle when Lois Lane leaves for Egypt. Like I said, most of this season has so much untapped potential. Another disappointing element of the season is the return of Chloe. Chloe is one of Smallville's most popular characters and her return is shoddy at best. The episode "Collateral" which introduces her return and is a rip-off of the Matrix is perhaps one of the worst episodes of the series. Other elements of the season such as the Vigilante Registration Act, The Suicide Squad, and the government's involvement of superheroes is shoddy, contrived, cheesy and unsubstantial at best. The episode Fortune which blatantly imitates the Hangover movies all but exemplifies the problem of this season in that it borrows from all sorts of popular movies and in the process loses its identity as a great Superman show. Also, Clark Kent decides to shed the Black trenchcoat and wear a Michael Jackson inspired "Thriller" jacket to reflect his growing optimism and hope necessary to become the Man of Steel. Unfortunately the new costume is very very cheesy. He would have probably been better off he kept the Black Trenchcoat untill he becomes the Man of Steel.<br />  Despite the disappointing nature of season 10, The series finale blew me away. I have to say the Series Finale is the best series Finale of any television show EVER! They did a perfect job of wrapping up 10 seasons of great memories while leading the groundwork for his role as Superman. I was absolutely shocked at the quality of the final episode especially since the rest of the season was mediocre. Other highlights include the season premiere as well as the 200th episode "Homecoming" which are some of the top episodes in the series. Overall, If you watched all of the other seasons and enjoyed them I strongly recommend you pick up the Final season to see how it all ends. The package is a mixed bag but the resounding conclusion will more than make up for it!
Smallville recently concluded it's 10 year run in May and while the final season itself wasn't the best of the series it did have many super moments, particularly the amazing Finale that would have been more amazing had we seen Tom Welling in the suit.<br /><br />However, Smallville has never looked or sounded better, for example, the Finale episode looks way better than any HDTV rip it is clearer and the main reason to own this besides the great 1080p video is the DTS-HD audio which is a first for the series on Blu Ray. The DTS track sounds unbelievable, it's loud, completely fills the room and is the best way to enjoy the final season of this awesome show.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
There's a lot of criticism concerning the ending of this series like it ran out of gas, Welling punked out, etc.  When this series was just a few seasons old, the point was made that this show would not be about Superman, the suit, flying sequences, etc. Rather it's about Clark's long journey and evolution to his eventual destiny. With that being said, a hearty well done is in order for all that was involved in this incredible series of the greatest comic book hero ever.  All was done tastefully and in the true Smallville tradition. I'm gonna miss it, but thank God for these DVDs.
I discovered Smallville in its 3rd season. I could not wait to go back and see the first 2 seasons. It has been my favorite show of all time. The writers have done a good job with keeping the story going and not bringing things out too quickly. I have all 9 seasons and can not wait to get that final season. The one and only flaw of the whole series is when they killed off Jimmy olsen at the end of season 8. Other than that, the whole series is great. I really loved the way they wrapped everything up in the final episode and finally all the superman elements were there.(Except JImmy Olsen)I will really miss not having a new episode to watch every week, but I guess all good things must come to an end. I will enjoy watching them on DVD.

All 22 Season 10 episodes in "matted" widescreen on 6 discs<br /><br />Episode List:<br />1) LAZARUS: GRADE A- ...Lois saves Clark from brink of death - reminiscent of the "Death of Superman" comic book cover. COMMENTARY<br />2) SHIELD: A- ...Clark begins to reembrace his primary colors thanks to Lois' rival, Cat Grant who arrives at the Daily Planet while she's in Egypt befriending Hawkman -minus the beard, handsome Michael Shanks. DELETED SCENES<br />3) SUPERGIRL: B ...Clark and Kara have a family reunion. Green Arrow reveals his identity not caring that his former love almost got killed protecting him. DELETED SCENES<br />4) HOMECOMING: A++ ...The scenes taking place in the future and the barn scene make this episode one of the very best. However, Oliver's speech was moronic and hypocritical given that he's the one who made the conscious decision to "step out of the shadows." FEATURETTE<br />5) ISIS: A ...The last fifteen minutes are DIAMOND-STUDDED GLORIOUS!!<br />6) HARVEST: A ...From start to finish, this episode might have been taken right out of "Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" - only much, much sexier and with an edge.<br />7) AMBUSH: A+ ...General Sam Lane played by the superb Michael Ironside arrives for Thanksgiving dinner. His idea for the Vigilante Registration Agency is actually what the Justice League will become in the future when Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman take over its leadership. The difference here is that Darkseid has agitated anti-hero sentiment allowing those who would enforce it to use it as a weapon.<br />8) ABANDONED: A- ...Tess Mercer aka Lutessa Lena Luthor learns about her past. Lois and Clark's parents deliver touching messages through video recordings. DELETED SCENES<br />9) PATRIOT: A ...Directed by Tom Welling, Aquaman and wife Mera show Clark and Lois the advantage of allowing your best girl to be your best ally. General Slade becomes Deathstroke after a run-in with the Justice League.<br />10) LUTHOR: B+ ...Welling in one of his most electrifying performances both as Kent and Luthor.<br />11) ICARUS: A+ ...Hawkman and Deathstroke's fight scene is the finest choreographed of the series. In the last scene, everyone involved is at their most beautiful - especially Erica Durance who looks like Wonder Woman and Welling who looks like THE Superman.<br />12) COLLATERAL: C- ...Written by Jordan Hawley -it's hard to believe this is the same person who wrote the masterpiece that is The Rain Scene in last season's "Rabid." He ridiculously glorified chloe at everyone's expense and made Lois sound stupid considering that when she bashed the "Tea Party" she was bashing her own father. The only things worth watching here were Black Canary, the virtual flight scene and Clark and Lois' first and last scenes together. Everything else was trash.<br />13) BEACON: D- ...Perry "Bulldog" White a she-man hippie? Ha! Yeah, right. With his classic choleric personality, he'd crash a war as an embedded journalist getting the stories first hand and not accepting anyone's spin on a story except his own. Hippies were not rebels. They were lazy, horny, dope-addicted cowards who started the "make love not war" hypocrisy just to avoid the draft. Notice they didn't have a problem sending others to war when they got into power (Bill Clinton, anyone?). They glorify JFK yet they conveniently forget that he's the one who got us involved in the Vietnam War in the first place. Ghandi, MLK Jr., the American revolutionists of the 18th century- they were genuine and admirable rebels. This makes two lousy episodes in a row that Lois is written out of character. She is not an unperceptive insecure feminazi. Lois Lane has been a strong, intelligent, confident, independent yet at her core (like Superman) passionate, loving, iconic gentlewoman for over seven decades so her scene with Martha Kent made no sense at all especially since they've known each other for years and Lois is the reason Martha's even in politics. Their interaction in "Hostage" was so much more natural. Welling's distraction for his other project really showed in this episode. At least the fan videos were nice. I liked the one sent in by the soldier. Other than that, this wasn't worth the time. DELETED SCENES<br />14) MASQUERADE: B- ...Ah, what a breath of fresh air it was to see MY Lois again after two miserable episodes. And Mr.Kent? Sexy, sexy, SEXY! It was so GOOD to see/hear their classic, hilarious, pure gold banter again! Downside: Episodes 12-15 shaped up to be chloe's Arc of Suck. At least this time, the iconic duo weren't completely sidelined.<br />15) FORTUNE: C+ ...Bursts of hilarity(courtesy of Emil-Elvis/Tess duet,drunken Clark,Oliver in drag)mixed with the Smallville writers' pathetic and very desperate attempt to cannonize themselves through their creation:chloe sullivan. They had her outright declare herself the "king maker" in being THE ONE who inspires Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman to greatness? I'd get mad at this if it wasn't so sad and ridiculous. Writers who can't exercise objectivity when the outcome of the story is on the line have no business being producers. Lois/Clark's eventual wedding was a payoff for stomaching all the shams: Lex/lana, chloe and the two cannon characters she had no business messing with. Because of her one ended up dead, the other with a dark mark and away from his destined true love. Seriously, if I were a family member of the creators of "the big 3" I'd sue them for disrespecting 7 decades of hard work by thousands of artists and craftsmen and the millions of fans who supported them. MUSIC VIDEO<br />16) SCION: D ...Besides giving Lionel a well deserved all around smack-down, there wasn't a point here that piqued interest. His re-introduction in "Luthor" was tantalizing but it turned out to be a DUD - as did the "Lex clone." A couple of scenes were just WRONG on so many levels. Definitely one of the worst stories of the series. It's like they tried to sneak in a pilot for a spin-off but it just fell apart into an unentertaining and somewhat disturbing mess. DELETED SCENES<br />17) KENT: B- ...Where "Luthor" was better done focusing on the family as a whole, "Kent" was lopsided in that the focus was the Kent Farm, not the family itself. It also focused too much on the Luthors again.<br />18) BOOSTER: A++ ...EXCELLENCE PERSONIFIED - BEST EPISODE OF THE SEASON AND THE SERIES. If this show were to have any kind of spin-off, I'd want it to be just like this. Written by DC Comics executive Geoff Johns and directed by executive producer/star Tom Welling, this is the only episode where only two regular cast members (Welling and Durance) appear. Handsome Eric Martsolf was born to play Booster Gold. Welling ends his Smallville directing career with IMPRESSIVE ECSTATIC SUPERMANLY FLAIR!<br />19) DOMINION: C ...Cheesy and predictable. The "gladiator" fight scenes were very funny, though - they looked like skinny spoofs of Conan the barbarian in slow motion. But at least it did (clumsily) move the story along and it was nice to see Callum Blue again albeit, clearly, not his best performance. COMMENTARY<br />20) PROPHECY: B- ...The "crazy quilt" of the season. Very nice moments sewn into a tapestry of visually rich scenes framed in stunning fashion. But, there was much, too, too much jammed into one single episode without proper exploration leaving one dissatisfied. Case in point:Kara's (Laura Vandervoort's) departure. It was an ill-conceived stunt even when DC allowed it in Justice League Unlimited. Perhaps, it was no accident that Season 9 (despite its plotholes)remained the greatest, most tightly executed season in the series' entire ten-year run AND it was also the one and ONLY season when Welling was fully engaged as star/producer the entire year (come season 10, his producing time was cut in half due to his "Glee knock-off" dramedy). Absent Welling's undivided attention to detail, 10 fell prey to the typical pitfalls of seasons 1-8: strong first half (and 10 did have the strongest ever) followed by a second half full of anti-climactic non-resolutions, strong story lines shamefully rushed, glossed over while weak and Superman-irreleveant arcs were wasted over several episodes.<br />21  SUPERMAN)FINALE PART 1: A++ ...The last episode filmed (as Part 2 was filmed third to last). It explains why most of the cast members seemed so genuinely emotional - in the barn, the door scene and then the wedding. They were tenderly staged and photographed - simple, elegant... beautiful.<br />22  SUPERMAN)FINALE PART 2: A++ ...For once, Ausiello was wrong and they stuck with "finale" as the official title. Just as well. For me, it confirms that the writers were never interested in telling Superman stories, only in using his fame to promote their show. Welling punked out. He did not wear the suit. The Fortress sequence was thrilling but after that, it was just close-ups of his face and an all CGI caricature. Still, the final 2 and 1/2 minutes were... PERFECT. Or, as perfect as this show ever got.<br /><br />I'll remember it as "the Superman show that wasn't about Superman." Thanks to certain elements though, Smallville's decathlon held glimpses of genuine cinematic greatness (if only Welling had the guts to follow completely through). All in all, it was an often interesting (when Clark and his Lois were the focus), at times too far-fetched (superlana and Black Canary-wannabe shortkick chloe) and needlessly melodramatic (lana seasons 3-8, chloe seasons 6-10, oliver season 10 and the stupid clark,lex,lana triangle seasons 5-8) but because of its source origin (and in spite of its  writers/producers), always hopeful decade - not because we want/need to believe in heroes but because there ARE heroes regardless of wether we believe in them or not. And, when these heroes' deeds eventually touch our lives, they inspire us to create new ones and become them ourselves. Writers come and go but Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster's original Superman vision shines as bright as always. 73 years and counting... he still stands for Truth, Justice and the American Way.

This is coming from a fan of the entire series. I have watched every episode, deleted scene, commentary, and other special feature from it. I even bought some of the music from it on itunes. When I got to this season, I couldn't wait to finally see superman. I was excited for the finale as I am sure any reader of this review would be.<br />I want to share my feelings about this season alone and hopefully it would help you decide whether or not to purchase it.<br /><br />I would only recommend buying it if you are diehard like me. If you haven't seen ALL of the episodes before this season, I really mean ALL, you may not understand the ending. This season is about tying up all the loose ends from EVERY previous episode. The series had a lot of loose ends in it and you can tell in this season the writer's had to select their words very carefully to be consistent throughout the finale story. They pulled off the finale exceptionally well but if you don't have the big picture of the other seasons first, you may get lost and regret using your money buying this season.<br /><br />If you watch movies and shows purely for entertainment purposes, you won't be disappointed. It is a very entertaining season. It has drama, humor, action, sexiness, and heartwarming moments. There are times where you will feel all emotions. There is one episode with Oliver Queen that I particularly think everyone would enjoy. I laughed so hard I am sure the neighbors a block away could hear.<br /><br />This season is about darkness and love. Both are portrayed visually. I would not allow someone younger than 16 to watch this because some of moments are a little too grown up for kids any younger. That's my opinion though.<br /><br />The bluray version, which I own, is probably not much better than the DVD version in terms of graphics and sound. You would be happy with either. I bought the bluray because I am a believer that bluray will last longer.<br /><br />I had high hopes that it would go out with a bang. It was actually how expected it to be. I give it four stars because I had fun but really I don't think everyone who watches it will.
This DVD collection of Smallville wraps up a ten year run of this popular series.  Loose ends throughout the series have been wrapped up and concluded.
Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season is a wonderful finish to a great series. The condition of the box set was wonderful, with the factory seals still on. Highly recommended.
I was of cource thrilled to see him fly and become superman.<br />But the acting of lois is really bad  and went on my nervs.<br />This was a bad coise of casting the role.<br />At all a good ending of a long jorney.
Every season of Smallville has been wonderful. I am sorry to see that number 10 is the last season. The series had wonderful young actors, especially for a television series. I just hope the actors can go on beyond Smallville to have a successful acting career.<br />Thank you.
I loved this series and really didn't want to see it go off the air.  This last season was one of the best.  It was the perfect ending to a ten year run, each disc makes you relive the last moments of this spectacular show.  The Blur and Green Arrow, made this show a must see for me. I think it was more of a science fiction series than your usual Superman, with all the special effects, aliens, and new gadgets they introduced all the time. Of Course, there was the romance between Clark Kent (Tom Welling) and Lois Lane (Erica Dorrance) that developed much further in this series than any other movie or series before it, they were the best episodes of all, especially the fact they let them finally get married.  This disc set of dvd's is great, beautiful picture and sound, it arrived before the delivery date, and in perfect condition.  I am very happy with this purchase.
A perfect ending to a great show!! Even though the show was coming off a weak season 9, season 10 really stepped it up. The return of Jonathan Kent and the Luthors it really was a season true fans can appreciate!! The only bad thing was the company Amazon got the set from. Warehouse Detail buyers beware!! The case was broken and the box was actually cut on the back. The packaging was way to tight causing even more damage to the box. The dvd"s were fine, but if you want a perfect box set, make sure you buy from another sellar!!
Arrived well in advance of promised delivery and was new as described. Played all episodes without issues.<br />I have enjoyed the entire series and would recommend the Smallville series to any and all who like Superman. While the story does not follow the same exact story line as the movies is follows well enough that you can enjoy this take of the legend of Superman. My biggest regret is that the series is finalized and there will be no more Smallville from this group.
5 star rating for the series as a whole. Sure there were ups and down, the worst being the doldrums of the mid-series' Lex and Lana years (such a waste of Rosenbaum) but overall this has been spectacular. I grew up reading Superman comics and watching various TV and film adaptations and as much as I loved Christopher Reeve as Superman I have to say this series is the best take on the mythos - and I just spent the last few months watching Smallville from start to finish. Every show has it's dogs, but when Smallville was firing on all cylinders it was spectacular TV. And since this is the set-up to a boy becoming a man it truly is the journey and not the destination that is important. We all have our quibbles, I would have preferred Zod or Lex being the main villain in the final season, but when you see most of the abysmal dreck churned out on TV these days I'm happy with what we got here. To the critics on Amazon who said, "That's it?" in regard to the last SHOT of the series, clearly, they didn't get it. Yes, that's IT, and real Superman fans will not only get it, but they'll love it.
Smallville has been one of my favorie TV shows.<br />They did a fantastic job of bringing everything full<br />circle and tieing it all together.  What a fantastic ending!
Not much we can add to what has already been said--but we wanted our five stars to be counted and so we leave this fairly useless review.  If you've watched all the previous seasons, this is a must of course!  LOL.
as always, beautifull presentation, outstanding packaging, and the content, well.. is smallville... preety funny audio commentaries in 2 episodes, (i could really use a couple more audio commentaries, but that's just me), i really recommend this purchase.
Smallville has been fun.  But it was time to end it.  This set comes in a plastic case that's pretty sturdy.  The previous seasons I've bought, except for 9, are in cardboard cases.  What I can say is to be careful and buy it right from Amazon.  I got it from a marketplace seller at first and was sent a bootleg copy.  It was a really authentic-looking copy.  But it was a copy none-the-less.  No copy protection.  Single-layer compressed video.  Pretty cheap veneer on the discs (easily scratched).  The authentic set is better quality.
A highly recommended item, awesome quality and the a really interesting argument. The only think I don't like so much was Darkside, besides that it was worth making the purchase.
Clark Kent faces his final challenge to finally become the Man of Steel in Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season. Clark Kent (Tom Welling) has come along way since his teenage years in Smallville High, and after years of struggling with the transition from boyhood to adulthood and forging his superhero identity, he is ready to jump into the spotlight as Earth's greatest protector. Unfortunately, a mysterious dark force has arisen, corrupting the minds of the populace and putting Clark and other superheroes in danger. With the help of Lois Lane (Erica Durance), Supergirl (Laura Vandervoort), the Justice League and his adoptive father Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), Clark will find the strength to overcome the darkness and embrace his fate. Smallville is the popular live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a young Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. The tenth and final season is somewhat uneven, but still offers a satisfying finale to one of the longest running television series. The final season also marks the return of many popular characters including arch nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and amusing appearances of other DC characters.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition of Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season won't be the highlight of your Blu-Ray collection, but fans of Smallville will be pleasantly pleased with its presentation and content. All 22 episodes of the final season are presented in 1.78 widescreen format. The picture quality surpasses those of previous high definition "Smallville" releases with its bright colors and solid contrast. Its DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track is quite excellent among television box sets. Its special features include audio commentaries with cast members and production crew on two episodes (Lazarus & Dominion), 4 minutes of deleted scenes and two featurettes (Back in the Jacket: A Smallville Homecoming & The Son Becomes the Father). Overall, Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season scores a "B".
I am only writing this review now because I was overseas when the last season aired on television, so I i've only now finished watching it. The show over it's ten years was great. While some say season ten might not be the best, I think every season had it's ups and downs. The only things I didnt like about season ten was Chole kept dissapearing for a few of the episodes, and we didnt get to see any of the Justice league guys come back for another team episode. All the returns of the past characters was great and it really helped the show have a nice conclusion. The finale as a whole was amazing. I had to watch it twice on my rental disc. Such a tear jerker and epic finish. Though they didnt show clark just standing around and talking in the suit, they showed him in it and flying which everyone has wanted since the show began. I started watching this show when it came out in 2001 and its hard to believe that it's actually over. I wish they would make a straight to dvd movie of it, but that's probably only wishful thinking. Either way, I will get the complete set on blu ray whenever it comes out and watch the whole show again many times over. Thanks Tom Welling and company for such a beautiful story of superman...now if they only get the new Snyder supes film right, I wont have to be sad that this show isn't still on the air!
I was so happy to receive it in time for Christmas. My husband loves smallville and I was pleased by the cost of this item. service was great. Thanks
We've always loved watching Smallville and to finally own the last season is great. It's a great series that my husband and I love to watch together.
Season 10 was a great way to end the series. The 2 hour finale was terrific but I would have liked to have seen more heroes from earlier seasons in the finale. It is interesting to see how the actors have changed over the 10 years. Darksied was the perfect villian for the final season.
I thought this was a great end to the season. Brought pretty much all the opening to a close. Wish the series didnt have to end though. Not much else to say.
I absolutely loved Season 10 for about 12 or 13 episodes. The first episode was absolutely friggin brilliant. The whole Lex Luthor thing even seemed feasible....a bit of a stretch...but I was willing to go with it.  The episodes that followed in which they were trying to figure out how their relationship could work was the brightest spot of the whole season for me. That whole darkness and cape business seemed to drag the storylines down. I wish the focus would have stayed on Clark and Lois. Loved the show. Hope their is a spin off of some kind in the future.
This item was exactly as shown, great deal and awesome customer care. Using Amazon from here on out for many more purchases.
I got a great price on this final season of Smallville DVD set.  The item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  Very satisfied and would definitely repeat.
This season box set completed my whole collection of this television series. If you love Superman, I highly recommend any of these DVD's. This season completes the whole transition of the character and has so many extra heroes if you love DC comics.
The last season of Smallville is extremely well done.  All the loose ends are tied up and some of our favorite characters return.  It is much lighter than season 9, with sweet story lines and happy endings.  I love it!!
as per title, it has to be good. Lasting 10 seasons is no fluke. Plus its in high def. Also, its Superman, the superhero of all superheroes. Ya.
For 10 years Smallville was a show I looked forward to and tried never to miss.  Some of the years were better than others; years 5 and 6 are particular standouts for me.  Some of the episodes were better than others.  All-in-all this last season did not disappoint.  The closer the end came, the harder the episodes must have been to write.<br /><br />There are few instances in these last years of TV Dramas which showcase the development of a strong,young repertoire of characters.  The final season was a fitting prequel  to the original concept of SUPERMAN.<br /><br />Adios, amigos, SMALLVILLE's conclusion as left a hole in my TV schedule, but I can revisit the series at will with the dvds.
I love it!!! It was the best. It tied up many of the story lines. I hated to see this series come to an end but man what a ride. It was great.
For the price it was amazing to receive something so cool.Whoa wow cool fantastic excellent dudes I am totally please for sure yall know.
The product was excellent and a welcomed end. Seeing that Smallville was a pre-Superman time period, I was bothered by how the series continually limited his ability, stretched out his learning curve, and dumb down his intellect. The series was entertaining and disturbing at the same time. "Somebody Save Me" will always be a memorable tune.
Smallville has had its ups and downs in its ten year run.  It seemed to struggle the most in the middle seasons, but the later seasons picked things back up again.  The final season for Smallville is still one of the better ones. The things that made Smallville great are still present: Lois and clark's fantastic chemistry, fun cameos from DC characters, good overarching storylines, and use of the Superman mythology. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to shake off the problems that have often been an issue in Smallville.  Some soap opera-esque drama, poor cgi, and anticlimactic conclusions to story arcs.  Season 10's best moments are when it begins moving Clark closer to becoming Superman. Seeing him wearing the glasses doing the dorky Clark Kent routine is just great. Lois and Clark's growing relationship is so much fun to watch.  (I think Erica Durance is my favorite actress who has portrayed Lois.). There are some really great episodes in this season, with a few ones that are homages to other movies ( including the hangover, the matrix, and thunderdome). Obviously the main draw of any show's final season is to see how it ends. The finale here is a microcosm of the entire series, it's a mix of great and dissapointing moments.  The resolving of the season-long story is quick and completely underwhelming.  (what about all that talk where this would be Clark's greatest challenge?) You will see him in the suit, but it's a quick look so don't expect much there. The best parts of the finale are its scenes between Clark an Lois, and Clark with his family. The return of Lex Luther brings the series full circle and will be a cool moment for fans. The 7 years later final scene also pays some nice homages to the Superman films.  It may not have been a completely satisfying finale, but it hits a lot of things that will make fans happy.  It's not the greatest show made, but it's the show we love despite its flaws. If your a fan of Smallville and/or Superman you will enjoy the final season of Smallville.
this product came to us in great condition and the price was great. we love smallville we enjoy watching an episode a night before bed. also another good Christmas gift thank you
It shipped fast but product was cheap looking. The box never closed properly. Probably won't buy from this place again.
We received this quickly and it was in great condition. We are completely happy with our purchase and we will definitely buy again.
This was a Christmas present and it arrived quickly! Plus, he price was lower than I expected. Since this is the final season, it made a great gift.
I love this show and season 10 is no exception. The only part I didn't like about season 10 was that it had to end lol. But the product was wrapped in a plastic wrap, signifying it was brand new. Awesome disc art. 5 out of 5 everytime!
I bought this for my Sister which loves the actor who plays Clark Kent, Box set came in mint condition and works great. Completes her collection and she had not one issue with any of the discs.
I have really enjoyed all the seasons of Smallville. I pre-ordered Season Ten and it was dispatached as soon as released. 10/10 for Amazon and Smallville!
Smallville is a beautiful show and blue ray does it justice but as with the past few seasons of smallville the extra features are lacking. i do not know why Welling does not involve himself in a show that he is the heart of. but for a smallville fan the BR version is the only way to go.
I have always been a smallville fan! The series started when in high school and I followed it until I started college and grad school. I just didn't have time to watch them so I bought the seasons when they came out on DVD and would watch them over the summer. I just recently bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend but it was for me as well :) We've watched the first 3 episodes so far and cannot wait to finish this epic final season!! Also it was a little cheaper to buy off amazon than in the store!!
Ordered as Christmas gift.  This completed the series.  It arrived quickly and without damage.  Great to have the final one on Blueray.  It shows the progress of technology throughout the running of the series!
I have to say it is that smallville season ten was amazing had me on the edge of my seat hrough the whole show every moment of it was great
After hating season 9, I was hoping 10 would make up for it.  It didn't.  It was ok, but not enough to make up for the rest.  Wishing now I had never bought ANY of the seasons.
Wait for nearly a year for this season top be released and burned right through the episodes with my wife.  We wished that MORE DC characters would have made the last season but at least they mentioned a millionaire with tech toys (Bruce Wayne.)<br /><br />Buy it!
I have all the seaons except season 1, this was the last season and it didn't disappoint us. Smallville is a great series and we are sad it has to come to an end.
This completed the small like set for my fianc&eacute; & he was very excited to have received it.  It was his favorite show!  I received it only days after ordering it.
This show really held my interest as a fan of Superman, and, this final season really did a fantastic job of bringing the legend to life!
The final season... but credit must be given to the show for wrapping up many loose ends this season and also for laying the groundwork for Clark to continue to grow up and become the Superman we know.<br /><br />Lots of extra/bonus material too.<br /><br />One can only hope that this cast will reunite for some Smallville/Superman/Superfriends movies down the road.
Smallville was a fantastic TV series from the the very first episode in 2001. The show did nothing but get better all the way through Season 10. Smallville had outstanding special effects and its use of characters introduced on the show and actors and actresses from previous Superman movies and TV such as Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher, Margot Kidder, Helen Slater and Terence Stamp as the voice of Jor-el was over the top. The final 2-hour Series Finale brought the whole 10 years together. The introduction of new stars such as Tom Welling, Kristen Kruek, Michael Rosenbaum, Erica Durance and Justin Hartley blended perfectly with more seasoned stars such as John Schneider, Annette O'Toole and John Glover. The use of the Superman musical score by John Williams and the new Smallville theme by Remy Zero completed the package. You don't have to be Superman fan to enjoy this DVD collection. I'm terribly sorry it's over but it set a standard for others to follow.
Amazon is always the bomb. Srevice,price n quality above expectations. Favorite season of smallville by far. Watched all seasons n this one tied them all together.
Great show, very good ending.Nice twists that are different from the comic. I would recommend this show to anyone. Suspenseful and keeps you interested.
My son in law is a fan of smallville. He has the rest of the seasons on either dvd or blueray. This blue ray completed his collection.
It was just GREAT! It was a gift to my husband and he keeps reviewing it over and over! Great buy! I will order again from AMAZON! Thanks
If you are into smallville or superman this is a must see, totally loved it though my husband was not as impressed as I was
This is the best season of smallville and it is even better in hi def i strongly urge you to buy this product
Like some other reviewers, I also grew up with the original Superman. I began watching the Smallville series with a little prejudice. However, once I began watching the series, my attitude changed and I was hooked. Smallville, I think, gives us a little insight on what it was like for Superman trying to grow up as a regular kid. I would highly recommend the series.
This season really wraps up 10 years of story line. There are some really good episodes. The best is an episode you could call "The Smallville Hangover". It is very funny, and just like the movie "The Hangover". Another episode, directed by Justin Hartley (aka Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) is probably the best episode of the season. The only reason I say that it isn't as good as season 9 is that they linger on one topic (I won't say what, as not to ruin it for ya'll) for TOO MANY EPISODES. There are some surprise guest stars, and some surprise 'blasts from the past'. If you are a true Smallville/Superman/DC fan, you will really get a kick out of this season. I DO recommend it. Just, don't be expecting it to be fantastic...If you ask me, Season Nine is the best season out of all of them. But Season 10 won't disappoint, as long as you don't expect it to be season 9.
I suppose I am a bit different having grown up with Superman in black and white but I find it detrimental to the episodes to spend as much as 25 minutes per episode in close ups of the most dysfunctional people/heroes in prime time since the advent of soap operas trying to figure themselves out, never so much indecisiveness.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Cassidy Freeman and Erica Durance are proven to be every bit as pretty in bluray. That's worthy of their entire close ups, but John Glover? Please! There should have been only brief seconds at a time, no offense John because you are one of the better actors on the show. OK, that's the downside, the rest is good!<br /><br />Lois and Clark are getting married - no they're not - yes they are - no there not, well if you don't pay close attention when it matters most to the answer - you'll miss it! And then you will go hummmm, better watch that again...got to love having it on discs!<br /><br />Many die but it was sad to see a favorite die - didn't see that coming. Best surprise was doc Emil and his best moment...well, along with Tess, it was fun to watch.<br /><br />I liked the boldness in bringing back characters from the dead and when in doubt - they just did anyway. I liked all that maneuvering, the use of Braniac was done nicely (had to say that `cause in the extra feature special, they said they slaved over that for days before they figured it out - not sure I would have admitted to that.)<br /><br />After all is said and done everything seems in place to go where............well, we already know the rest of the story!
Smallville ends its amazing series with yet another season that I wish wouldn't have ended. With the exception of the 9th season and some of the Lana episodes (never did like her) I have LOVED this series more so than any other television series. Smallville Season 10 doesn't disappoint. I will miss this series a lot. At least I can rewatch the old ones!
If you are looking for the well written, well produced, and well directed episodes from the early years of this acclaimed series you probably won't find it in this loose collection of bizarre nursery rhymes.<br /><br />This great series, which I anticipated with each new week, has taken a serious tumble in this jumble of nonsensical short stories. Many are rehashes of stories already told (must have run out of new ideas) and very few afford us more than a brief 45 minute glimpse, which ultimately provides the viewer with a shallow, under-developed story that is way too short to provide any depth to the characters or meaning to the story.  Previous years saw running story lines from one episode to the next that provided us with all the information we needed to become immersed in the story line and the characters, but this season seemed to be produced more for quantity and less for quality (courtesy of Mr. Welling who was the executive producer for the entire season).<br /><br />Some of the ideas were just plain dumb,like the episode etitled "Granny Goodness", who appears as an evil and sinister old lady who is into S&M and keeps a bevy of scantilly clad "torture girls who are into martial arts".  I know this series is based on a comic book but this is lowering the bar too far.<br /><br />Now for the biggest disappointment! If you, like I, have been watching this series faithfully and anticipating the moment when Clark actully learns to fly, then brace yourself for a quick few seconds of an "animated" sequence of a small indistinguishable figure zipping through the far horizon.<br /><br />If you are a completist you definitely should purchase the collection, but do so knowing that if you enjoyed the series as much as I did, this season may not meet the high expectations it used to deserve.<br /><br />On a positive note I enjoyed seeing Lex again (the show was never the same after he departed) but even he couldn't measure up to his old evil ways in the few minutes afforded him in the final episode.<br /><br />Great series, very weak final season!
I own every season of Smallville on box set and am so looking forward to Season 10's box set as well.  This season culminated in the most satisfying series finale that I have ever seen on a television show to date.  As a fan of Superman since I was a little girl, this series from the start was refreshing in the fact that it was the journey of Clark Kent to become the Superman everyone knows and loves.  The finale definitely delivered, from the tights, to the flight, and finally at the end, the music that has raised goosebumps on every fan's arm since we first heard it.  Congrats to everyone who had a part on Smallville for a job well done.
Without including spoilers, I would like to say that this was a great series in the Superman mythology.  I really appreciated the time taken to research the history of the story and come  up with compelling, updated story lines. This season, the writing staff seemed to know where they wanted to go, a wedding between Clark and Lois. As a viewer, this was pathetic.  It had been done before at least 3 times in the series and this particular wedding was the most boring of them all.  The final episode was VERY self-indulgent through a boring montage of past episodes and didn't address some of the most interesting plot-lines. What happened to LANA?!?!<br />This box set is actually pretty good, however.  The season in entirety is very well done.<br />I'm not sad I watched it because I have enjoyed the series so much.  I'm just left with a disappointed taste in my mouth from the conclusion episode.
There have definitely been times in the previous couple of seasons where I felt like Smallville may have outlived its best years. But this last season really brought its A game back! I think my favorites will still be among the earlier seasons (I miss the wonderful friendship/threat of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor so much) but this one is very strong and I'm glad the series went out on such a good note.
Excellent product. Great end to a great series. Well done to the writers who completely tied all the story lines from all previous seasons. Very well done!
Ordered this final episode for my kids who are smallville junkies, it was a great series they already finished it !<br />Order was great and recvd in good packaging and way before the estimated arrival date
this item shipped in the time estimated, and was exactly what i ordered. my husband was so excited to receive this as a christmas gift this year - now we have the entire series! :)
Season 10 is absolutely amazing.The episodes are funnier and more interesting than previous seasons.Clark Kent is the true form of a reliable and honest person and a hero.Smallville is the best interpretation of Superman on television.It does not only focus on Superman,It also focuses on the disguise of Kal-El who is Clark Kent.Can't wait to buy this DVD!
I have watched this show from the very first episode.  I have truly enjoyed every episode of season 10 so far. I my humble opinion this is by far the best season.  This season finally made want all the seasons on dvd.  The sets normally cost 59, 48 or 42 dollars.  They were too pricey for me to catch up or so i thought. Thank God I decided I wanted the sets during the holiday season. I waited for Black Friday hoping for a deal. I found the perfect price and  acquired seasons 1-9 of this show from Best Buy on Black Friday for $ $9.99 each. Now I can watch this show whenever I want. This is still no consolation I will miss the show when it ends.  I  will also miss the actors that made this show great. I wish them the best in their future endeavors.  I will watch all the  seasons (especially season 10, if I can find it for $9.99 next Black Friday )with a smile on my face.
The 10th, and final, season of SMALLVILLE was a refreshing mix of the old Smallville and the new. Tom Welling did some of his best acting in Season 10 as Clark Kent/The Blur and soon-to-be Superman! Clark finally morphed into a confident, mature hero that longtime viewers could see becoming Supes! And FINALLY Erica Durance was in EVERY SINGLE episode in Season 10 as Lois Lane! Welling and Durance as Clark and Lois were able to take their chemistry to another level and become the iconic couple. It may be "Smallville", but this version of Lois and Clark is going to be a tough act to follow!<br /><br />In addition to Welling and Durance, Season 10 regulars included Cassidy Freeman (as Tess Mercer since Season 8) and Justin Hartley (as Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow since Season 6). And Allison Mack reprised her role as Chloe Sullivan in a limited fashion (appearing several eps throughout the season, including the finale).<br /><br />Season 10 also brought back virtually all of the important characters during the show's formative years (Martha and Jonathan Kent, Lex and Lionel Luthor, Zod, Kara, Brainiac). These old characters served as a reminder of where Smallville came from and how it got to the point where it was, while still managing to move the story along.<br /><br />The Season 10 story arcs are the arrival of Darkseid through the portal that was opened in the Season 9 finale when Zod and the Kandorians went to their new home world, the clone Lex storyline, and the VRA subplot. While I thought the Darkseid stuff was a mixed bag and the VRA pretty useless, the clone Lex story was the saving grace of the subplots, as well as Clois. Also, it was in the Season 9 finale that Lois realized Clark's dual identity so in Season 10, she knows all about him, but doesn't let him onto it until the right time.<br /><br />Season 10 got off to a great start with the fascinating episode Ep 1-LAZARUS, a wonderful teaser as to Clark's future potential as Superman with an aging clone of Lex Luthor (excellently played by MacKenzie Gray) escaping a Luthorcorp facility and wreaking havoc on Metropolis and Lois Lane; Clark has to save the day in typical Superman fashion! Also, a lone surviving clone of Lex, the little boy Alexander, is saved by Tess from the facility before it is destroyed and this clone ages to several stages of Lex's life in future Season 10 eps. The ep ends with a heartfelt conversation between Clark and Jonathan's ghost (reprised by the esteemed John Scheider) and the entrance of Darkseid!<br /><br />Arguably the best ep of Season 10 is Ep 4-HOMECOMING (also the 200th ep of the series), which has a sort of "Christmas Carol" vibe with an improved, futuristic good-guy version of Brainiac (brilliantly reprised by James Marsters, who played the role in Seasons 5 and 7) taking Clark on a journey through his past, present, and future which leads Clark to realize his potential as Earth's savior. It also includes one of the best moments of Season 10 (heck, the series!) with a beautiful Clois scene at the end of a declaration of love and Clark floating!<br /><br />Other early standouts of Season 10 include the underrated Ep 5-ISIS, a very funny, quick-witted ep which allows the 4 main cast members to all shine (really enjoyed Justin Hartley's work in this ep!) and includes semi-regular character Cat Grant (played hilariously by Keri Lynn Pratt introduced in Ep 2-SHIELD) and has yet another smashing Clois moment at the end with Tom Welling delivering an amazing speech to Lois! Also Ep 7-AMBUSH brings back the always reliable Michael Ironside (reprising the role of Lois' dad General Sam Lane) and Peyton List (again playing Lois' sister Lucy); both characters were introduced in Season 4, Lois' first season on the show. Ep 8-ABANDONED is a haunting ep where Clark, Lois, and Tess are forced to confront their familial demons from the past. Ep 10-LUTHOR is one of the top Season 10 eps with Clark accidentally going to an alternate universe where we again get to see Lionel Luthor (reprised by the great John Glover, who was a regular for the first 7 seasons), who in the alternate world raised Clark's evil doppel ganger Clark Luthor. Ep 11-ICARUS is the one where Clark proposes to Lois.<br /><br />The second half of Season 10 includes the standout eps 13-BEACON (where the radiant Annette O'Toole returns as Martha Kent) and a teenaged clone of Lex (well played by Lucas Grabeel) seeks revenge on Clark. Ep 14-MASQUERADE is a funny, witty ep, the one where Clark realizes he must start wearing glasses to hide his true identity.<br /><br />The last part of Season 10 goes out on a high note with a string of awesome eps! In Ep 16-SCION, the clone Lex story comes to an end as the teen clone (Grabeel again in a fine turn) turns out to share Lex and Clark's DNA and ends up as Connor Kent (future Superboy!). Ep 17-KENT is another best ep of the season contender as Clark Luthor returns sending Clark back to the alternate world where he meets none other than the alternate Jonathan Kent (reprised again by Schneider), a bitter man because the alternate Oliver Queen had mined farmers' land for Kryptonite in order to find a way to stop Clark Luthor. Ep 18-BOOSTER is a suprisingly entertaining ep with future superhero Booster Gold (hilariously played by Eric Martsoff) dropping in on Metropolis to steal Clark's thunder, as Clark must immerse himself more and more into the nerd-with-glasses persona to throw people off. Ep 19-DOMINION marks the return of Zod (reprised by the mercurial Callum Blue, who played the role all of Season 9) as Clark and Oliver travel to the Phantom Zone where the Kandorians have imprisoned Zod. Ep 20-PROPHECY is the pre-finale ep where Lois gets Clark's powers for a day and makes a shocking pronouncement at the end; Durance's emotional acting at the end of this ep and also at the end of Dominion is Emmy-worthy!<br /><br />Eps 21 and 22 are the FINALE parts 1 and 2 (shown as a 2-hour episode originally) that includes Clark and Lois' wedding, Darkseid's attack on Earth, and the return of none other than Lex Luthor (reprised by the terrific Michael Rosenbaum, who brilliantly essayed the role for the first 7 seasons)!<br /><br />In the end, I'd say SMALLVILLE gave the fans what it really wanted...Clark Kent becoming Superman!<br /><br />Season 10 Regulars: Tom Welling, Erica Durance, Cassidy Freeman, Justin Hartley, and Allison Mack.
I liked the trial and how they led up to the end covering the marriage between him and Lois (how it keeps getting put off to go to the alter but they really are married in every sense of the word, Lex comes back, but I liked how he and Green Arrow had to face Darkside and his Fathers that meant the most to me, how he looked inside himself to become the man the world needs and knows later on (part of watching Superman should make YOU feel INSIDE like busting through the trails we all feel and how he faces it SHOULD inspire US in the Show.  We watch a show to have fun for an hour and get inspired right?,(sample it on HULU.COM) if you need to before you buy, but those of us that have the first 9 seasons mostly will get the 10th.  The end preps you for the TV series Justice Leauge they may make or Avengers, we all like different things, so just remember what one person says compaired to another is not neccisarily how you feel, so sample it on HULU.  I did not like the episode with the bug and Power Gold, but there was other ones I loved! And yes, they kill off 2 main charachters in the end! But I will not tell you who.
Just when it is getting GREAT!  I can't believe that they are canceling the best show on TV!  Just when all of the terrific heroes such as Green Arrow, Hawkman, Aquaman, Flash and the others are only starting to come into their own they are taking it off the air!  (Although their Cyborg is VERY lame!)  Come on now.  Let us see the Justice League of America for real!  Let us see Clark and Lois married for a while!<br /><br />The show is more popular now than ever I'm sure.  Warner Brothers and DC comics, please keep this show running longer.  Say another 10 years or so???  LOL
Rather like the make-it-up-as-you-go-along shows "The X-Files," and "Lost," it's obvious that the "Smallville" creators never expected this series to last more than a couple of seasons at best.  By season 10 Smallville and the Kent farm are not much more than a place to feed the dog and stare out toward the heavens from the hay loft of the barn.  From the beginning the series made the bold (and not necessarily wise) decision to discount the existing Superman myth and create a soap opera that would focus on entertaining young teens.  Once it was clear that this excursion would have little (or nothing) to do with the comic book character, I just went along for the ride, finding some episodes worthwhile and others close to embarrassing.  We find strange, distorted personifications of the Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Supergirl, select members of the JLA, etc., with the stitching for all frayed and generally disappointing.  Like so many other successful programs, "Smallville" did its best to fill the unexpected void opened up to the producers, cast, crew and scriptwriters.  Sometimes I really wanted to shame the writers for their staggering lack of imagination and reliance on older, staid sci fi material.  Since the series cowered away from turning Kal El into the ultimate superhero for years, we were always left with a kind of quasi-Superman, emotionally unbalanced, unfocused, and ignorant of his role as a self-sacrificing hero.  On balance, I credit the cast that so often made the totally ridiculous into something palatable.
This show has changed so much over a 10 year run. The only original characters left were Clark of course and Chloe(MY FAVORITE).<br />The original laws of anyone who finds out he has powers dies ended long ago. Fot a few seasons It was nothing more than a night time soap opera. With everything for 1 special effect was even gone.<br />Still the effects of there slow motion technique, allowing us to see what happens In the blink of an eye Is well worked and Impressive.<br />So now the ending.<br />Without giving anything away, It was the most creative season In 3 years. Everything and the many many subplots were all explained or had an ending. I guess that's the good thing about knowing It was the last season the cast seemed to want to work even harder for that lasting Impression of their acting.<br />I'd give this 5 stars If I was rating my personal taste and if a 4.5 I would but I can't give It 5 stars. It's just not In that catagory In any way.<br />BUT please all you long time fans will love the season and 2 episode ending. After Zod, this was fresh and Lois of course who brought the show the best new blood of all when she arrived' Is the best of the season again. I believe her and Tess are the best actors on the show.<br />Get this on Blu Ray If you can, It's eye popping. The top of the daily Planet , and everything. Hope this helps at all.
Yes, this was choppy at times, but haven't most of the SV seasons for the past 4 been choppy? Here in ten, Clark sort of gets back in the groove and begins to take on the seriousness that is needed as he transitions to Supe. The special FX are getting better every season and this looks especially good on a High Def TV. Enjoyable, still not tops like the first few seasons were. We have high hopes for this final season though showing right now and the last few episodes should be the best ever.
It's been a long ride... and Clark has finally earned his tights, boots and cape! The world is ready for Superman, and Clark is ready for the huge undertaking this represents. We got to grow with young Kal-El, we went hand in hand through ten years of trials and new abilities... and finally he has come unto himself: A gorgeous reporter witha nerdy hairstyle and thick Buddy Holly glasses, a mild stutter... and oodles of charisma to go with it all. We enjoy the image of a mature superhero in his late twenties, at peace and in love... and fighting the greatest evil in the universe as a final rite of passage. Clark is no longer the Blur... he is the Man of Steel!<br />This season has some awsome drama, unexpected turns, memories of the past, high school flashbacks, two weddings, love, sex, villains and heroes... and the very anticipated return of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to consolidate himself as superman's greatest adversary in the future. And of course.... flying.<br />Made ME fly. A great way to end an epic series!
On my Son's Wish List so I imagine that he liked it. He now has all but #8 and #9. Thanks
I enjoyed this tenth season very much.  I liked the episodes and how the producers wove past and present characters into the season.  I might have made some plot changes myself, but I think everyone has their own ideas about changes they would make in a series or movie.  That's part of the fun.
Smallville is a great season, and I just hate to see it come to an end!  The item arrived in the condition that it was described.
I am sad to see it come to an end. This has got to be the best season. If you have kept up with the story and every season up until now you will probably feel the same. I just don't want it to end but I know it has to. There are some really great moments in this final season and it is a nice epic conclusion to a really long running series.
Very well put together DVD set. This Season Ties in the Smallville Story with the Superman Movies. Enjoyed all 10 seasons.
Perfect!  Made my boys happy to be able to continue watching the series! Arrived in great ready to use condition.  Can't wait for the next season to be released.
