The season was good but the last episode.....................
Great Season Opener but...
Last Season
cliche galore
BLECH!  Season 1 was good. By season 10 the show was bad. The finale had him in cgi - lol bad!
The End?
Blu-ray cheaper than DVDS? Seriously?
Worse in the ten year history of the series
Randon,a big deal for no reason,gonna take a while to befor I will want to buy this season.
A hero is only as credible as his villain
Um....pre order already??
all moral, no story
Best Season Ever.
Absolutely Horrible
lame lame lame and more lame...
Smallville as a Whole  - 5 Stars
"Smallville" ends its epic run with a compelling tenth season
Smallville Season 10, out on top
A Solid, Yet Sometimes Rocky Season.
Disappointing Final Season but with an EPIC Finale!
You ain't seen it till you've seen it on Blu Ray
FANTASTIC SERIES. FANTASTIC FINISH.
