Although these are ok pilates moves, this is not a challenging workout.  I don't think this offers anything over standard pilates DVDs and is a bit slower than the ones I already own.
I bought this video because I was interested in Pilates and how it could improve my relationship.  It is a very straight forward, easy to follow video that works muscles I didn't realize I had.  The actual workout would be a little easier to follow with some pilates background because it is difficult to hit some of the positions while turning your head to look at the t.v. screen, but practice solves that problem.
