I think this is the most underrated movie I know of. And I frankly don't understand why it's not a major hit readily available on DVD. It's very well directed and cast -- I especially like Giancarlo Giannini (sp?), but Conti and Olmos and others were great too. However, the real power of the movie derives from the quality of Celia Gittelson's story. It's intelligent, warm-hearted, deep, and very funny. I watch it on sad evenings before I fall off to sleep, and life's not so bad.<br /><br />I can't help using this as a forum to explain what I see in the movie.<br /><br />The Pope grows heavy from being an abstraction -- longs to return to the life of a priest where he can do some concrete good for concrete people. And suddenly he finds himself with an opportunity to wander in the world incognito.<br /><br />This of course leaves room for all kinds of hysterical lines by people who don't know who he is ("You can go straight to hell. Who do you think you are?" or "Maybe he's a priest?" "Naw, a priest would tell us we go to hell for this."), and how his friends at the Vatican try to cover for him ("You got a job?... With all due respect, your Holiness, can't these villagers sort their own rags?")<br /><br />And there's one concrete thing that he wants to do. He -- the most significant -- is guided to it, by one of the most insignificant a deaf girl from a small village (Isabella) who has taken the step of leaving her home to find him... and this act somehow demands that he respond.<br /><br />It's the story of how the Christ figure (who I regard as our own true self) comes to earth and lives among us; how he works; what doubts, fears and confusions he has; what matters to him; what effect he has on various types of people. It's an explanation of the mechanism whereby mankind is redeemed.<br /><br />The mechanism is to go to a place where people are defeated, take on some arbitrary project which represents a positive step, and simply act. The extent to which you know what you're doing is irrelevant. What matters is the intention.<br /><br />The Pope chooses in this defeated village to rebuild the aqueduct. He knows nothing about construction. And as none of the important people -- the adult males -- will help, he gets his help from those whom society deems insignificant -- orphaned children, widows.<br /><br />And then you see the incredibly venomous and destructive reaction which his actions evoke in the negative forces in the society. They begin by burning the partially reconstructed aqueduct. At this point Isabella's beautiful, sane and soulful mother -- with whom he is falling in love -- asks him, "So what are you going to do?" "I'll build it again." "He'll just burn it again." "So I'll build it again. And when he comes back, I'll be here. I'll be waiting for him."<br /><br />It maybe sounds stupid, but on several occasions in life, I've felt defeated -- my actions seem to be in a void, no one notices -- and this movie somehow helps me to get off my duff and 'rebuild the aqueduct'... restore my faith that my intention is heard somewhere in the ether, even if I can't see the results.<br /><br />I find myself these days also relating the film to world politics. It's an essentially European film, and it restores my faith somehow that despite all their criticism of the US these days, Europe does understand the mechanism of nihilism and restoration. Europe too is on some level understandably defeated. And for all her doubts and failings, I believe the US is a positive force in the world...<br /><br />The second attempt to burn is headed off by his band of ophaned boys whose allegiance the Pope has usurped from the main bad guy (Olmos). In the third burning, the incredibly charming leader of the gang is killed. He's the sacrificial lamb which spreads the Pope's intentions among the community as a whole. The Pope now feels defeated, but the community fills in.<br /><br />And then there's the one town drunk, Abalardi, who lives on the outskirts, tends sheep, and is the only one who recognizes the Pope for who he really is. ("Please excuse the sheep. They see so few Popes... They fired you or what?" "No, I hadn't thought of that. No, they didn't fire me. Maybe God did..." "I can put your mind to rest on that... there's no such person.") Abalardi has the best role, and it's acted perfectly. At last the Pope asks, "Who are you, Abelardi?" I can keep a secret.
What a heartwarming, touching, perfect movie. Why doesn't someone release this gem on DVD. Don't need no special features, don't need no previews, don't need no cast bio's - just need this wonder film on DVD!
The premise of this movie is what captivated me.  The Pope on the loose.  How would or could he cope?  There are too many flaws to rate this too highly (most would think I already have, but I never tire of seeing this movie, especially with someone who hasn't seen it.  Haven't shown it to anyone who didn't like it.  Give it a view.  And by the way, I'm not the only one who'd buy the DVD immediately.
I SAW THIS FILM AS A CHILD AND IT IS ONE OF THE FILMS I AM MOST FOND OF.  IT IS RARE FOR A MOVIE TO LIVE IN THE THOUGHTS OF SOMEONE FOR SO LONG BUT I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY I WOULD FIND A COPY FOR MYSELF.  TRULY A GREAT FILM.
This film is not just a must see, it is a must own.  You will definitely want to bring out this film over and over to see again.  From its creative, unique plot, funny lines, irony, beautiful scenery, marvelous acting, and wonderful, not just feel-good but make-you-think message,  you will want to add this movie to your favorites list.<br /><br />Saving Grace delights, inspires and gently admonishes the viewer to find and be faithful to the things in life that really matter, despite the naysayers and obstacles that mount up to try to obscure the simple good all around us.  This film is the opposite of in-your-face religion; instead it is about all of us finding the love and goodness in the rough and simple places all about us, rather than in the high places.<br /><br />When I stumbled onto this movie some years back in a video store, the film quickly became a favorite, that I regularly showed to family and friends, and to youth groups.  All loved it, both the guys and the girls.<br /><br />I would always bring it out Saving Grace to view when I became overwhelmed or beaten around by life.  To my great remorse, my VHS copy was lost when I loaned it out and never got it back.  That was several years ago.<br /><br />Now I am on this site looking for a copy on DVD to buy, and grumbling because it doesn't seem to be available.  Once I find the DVD version, I will purchase at least 5 copies,for myself and to give as gifts to family and friends.  I hope the powers that be come to their senses and make this beautiful film available on DVD.  It also would be great to see on TV; I can imagine it becoming a recurring favorite through the years.
This is a movie that lifts me up when I'm down.  I too wish it was on DVD.  I read through a few of the five star ratings and really liked what they had to say.  I wish more people in the world were like this.  I know of few people who are very good to other people and have charitable dispositions.  I like to watch this movie and try to live the example that was set.  Please get it made into a DVD.
I saw this movie first in 1995 and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love the story, the characters, the fine acting.  It is a truly a beautiful movie.  A gem.
Story, movie and acting all come together in this movie. They sure don't make them like this any more. It's a must have. I WANT IT IN WIDE SCREEN FORMAT DVD. NOW!!!
Tom Conti's "Saving Grace" is a largely unknown, underrated movie, perhaps because it was made abroad and most of the casts were unknown actors (save Tom and a young Edward James Olmos). However, the plot of the movie and the story line was excellent.<br /><br />It tells the story of a future Pope Leo XIV (played by Conti), who was isolated from his flocks, living in Vatican and surrounded by Vatican bureaucrats he had to deal with everyday. He wished that he is able to travel outside to see how his people live their lives and deal with real-life problems. One day, somewhat unexpectedly, he got his wish. He accidentally got locked out from the Vatican and decided to travel to a rural and impoverished Italian village that suffered from all the disasters and misfortune one can imagine (epidemic, unemployment, chronic poverty, failing infrastructure, etc). He decided to attempt to rekindle the spirit of the local people by (at first) single-handedly rebuild an old malfunctioning village aquaduct. Soon, he started to win followers from the young hopeless residents of the village, but he also encounters many obstacles and learnt a great deal about himself and how his ministry supposed to be like during his time in the village. This experience transforms the way he conducts his Petrine ministry in many ways.<br /><br />This is a must see movie for Catholics (or anyone for that matter) that often thought that the Pope, the bishops, and the clergymen were often out-of-touch with the concerns and problems of lay Catholics. I wish the experiences of Leo XIV could happen more often in real life and transform the way Popes and bishops govern the Church. But till then, you should watch this movie, enjoy it, and pray that the transformation told in it would occur in our Church today.
This movie is great! I have it on vhs and have watched it for years but have been waiting for an official release to dvd but it hasn't happened. When I saw that Amazon manufactures it on demand I was skeptical, but I ordered it anyway and was not disappointed in the least. The quality of this dvd is just as good as what any studio would release. So if you're hesitant in purchasing this because Amazon manufactured it, DON'T BE!  Purchase it-you won't be disappointed either!
It literally took me years to figure out the name of this movie.  I just remember seeing and loving this movie back when I was a child.  Like the 40+ others reviewing this I say, "GIVE US A DVD OF THIS TO BUY!"
This is such a wonderful heart warming movie! I wish that there was some way to get it out on DVD! I've watched it many times and it always makes me  believe again in goodness in the world.
I can in no way improve on what has been said already.  This film should be be treated as a classic that will be watched for many years to come.  PLEASE!!! get this onto DVD.  I will buy it immediately along with extra copies for others.  This is a real jewel!
I saw this charming film on the recommendation of my brother in law. A film about a pope who gets locked out? Eeeehhhhhhhh, I dunno.<br /><br />My husband and I watched it and were absolutely charmed. We have been looking for a DVD version for the last few years to add it to our library and share with our kids.<br /><br />BRING THIS GEM TO DVD!
A friend recommended this to me years ago, and when I saw the video, I loved it. Later my wife bought the VHS for me, but I hope that it will be released on DVD one day.<br /><br />Although listed as a comedy--and it does have a strong humorous flavor throughout--it is a powerful drama about spiritual growth, hope, despair, love, and self respect. Reminiscent somewhat of "Shoes of the Fisherman," starring Anthony Quinn, from several years earlier, this is the story of a Pope's returning to his roots of being a pastor and helper of mankind--something he found difficult, if not impossible, to do in the Vatican. Somewhat by accident, he embarked on a spiritual journey and once again proved that he was a true priest of God.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, please do so. It is somewhat of a "sleeper" and may be difficult to find. Quite frankly, I don't know why it didn't get more visibility.
I remember seeing the preview to this movie when it was released in the theaters, and thinking, "Sounds Funny!" Well, we may have been a little mislead by that. However, this movie shows what we all must go through at one time in our lives: Self-Realization. As the Pope, is Leo really doing God's work? As a figurehead, maybe. But that's not why he became a priest. His lack of opportunity to help others, and the guilt that it brings to him is sparked by a small girl from a remote town who comes all the way to Rome to tell him that her town has no priest. His heart aches, and when he finds himself locked out of the Vatican and dressed pretty much like a bum, his impulse is to find this town and see how life can be infused back into it. Along the way, he meets bullies, theives, and love. This movie could have gotten ugly, and we could have seen the Pope in bed with a beautiful young woman, whom he understandably finds very attractive. Instead, we see a morality tale, where he won't be stopped from helping these people when they don't want to help themselves. He suffers a tremendous loss when a boy from the village is mudered, but through his death, the town once again comes alive. They do in fact have a priest in their town, and with Leo's help, he finds God again. There are plenty of smiles in this movie, but I am more touched by the story of a man who truly wants to help his fellow man. I know this is a little known show. Too bad. There are so many good lessons to be learned. But as is has no wild sex scenes, or guns blasting, most people aren't interested. I wish there were more shows like this one. After watching it, you feel like even you may make a contribution to someone's life that will change it forever, just like Leo did.
SAVING GRACE (Dir. Robert M. Young, Writ. Richard Cramer after Celia Gittelson's novel, 1986, 112 minutes). OK, my review title is a cheap shot. Let me explain: this excellent film (I truly love it) came on the heels of the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978. That was the year of 3 popes and 2 conclaves: Paul VI died, John Paul I was elected and died 33 days later, then Pope John Paul II was elected.<br /><br />It wasn't until the early 1980s that the smear campaign story got out: someone had "murdered" Pope John Paul I. A book was published on the subject in the 1980s (David Yallop's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786719842">In God's Name: An Investigation Into the Murder of Pope John Paul I</a>, see my review). This is 'the original SAVING GRACE' (with at least one other film and one TV series having the exact same title ... WHY??) and with Robbie Coltrane's disastrous turn in 1991's THE POPE MUST DIE (later retitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630227706X">The Pope Must Diet [VHS</a>] after a terrible international stink, see my review) make up what I used to call "The Vatican Duo".<br /><br />Later, someone would come along and pin the slight misnomer "The Vatican Trilogy" on Morris West's books.<br /><br />Here, at least, there is a sane approach to the life we suppose the pope lives at the Vatican. Tom Conti, a doubtful cardinal, gets elected pope (I believe he chooses the name Leo XIV). Soon he gets himself locked out of the Vatican (they say this happened to John Paul I) due to his gardening clothes - he looks like a bum, so he runs off to live like one. I am sorry about the delirious fan who states to me that he does not run off to live like a bum, but if you know anything of this film, you know he ran off to live like a bum in a nearby village.<br /><br />What, the man didn't know how to use a phone from just outside Vatican City? Anyway, he goes to a small quarantined village and makes a home there. I love the reviewer who compares Conti's pope to the Christ figure. I never thought of it that way, and I saw this film new when it was released. I've watched it ever since, and it improves with age.<br /><br />Naturally Leo wishes to put the townspeople back on their feet, and he's lucky: no one recognizes him. Only ex-priest Abalardi recognizes him. Then Leo has to do battle with the criminal forces of the village. The talent here is a marvel for such a low-budget production: Fernando Rey as Stefano Cardinal Biondi, the Camerlengo; Giancarlo Gianini as ex-Father Abalardi the shepherd; Edward Olmos in an early role, as Ciolin the villain and gang-leader; and the lovely Patricia Mauceri as the charming Lucia.<br /><br />Viewers will immediately see the obvious connexion with Morris West's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HD7KD0">The Shoes of the Fisherman Volumes One and Two</a>. This is, after all, about a suddenly elected pope who doesn't want the job and longs to escape from the Vatican. He manages to do so, and gets invovled in all kinds of highjinks. That is the basic synopsis for SAVING GRACE and FISHERMAN. Naturally, no one could do a pope-oriented film without acknowledging Morris West's final 3rd of his 'trilogy', <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1902881842">The Clowns of God</a> (see my review of that, it really deserves to be made into a film).<br /><br />I cannot give away the whole story as the great reviewer had to do to make his point about the pope and Christ. I can only promise that you will grow to love this gentle, silly film as I have, over time, and you will appreciate it now more than ever.<br /><br />May I add that if fans do not like my reviews or feel they are somehow worded wrongly, bug off and write your own review, quit reading mine! Also, I think a writer who doesn't edit/rewrite is definitely not a writer.
When I first saw this movie it lifted me up. If only a real Pope could be so spiritual. Lent it to a Buddhist priest and a Catholic friend and they both praised the movie, and the feelings it brought out in them.<br /><br />The Giannini character says God doesn't exist but he hopes that's not true. The movie makes you believe that, if God does exist, it would be a wonderful thing. And maybe God does exist.<br /><br />But it's not a religious movie, it's a movie about people and a movie that's wonderfully done . . "Full of wonder" . . hmm.
Why, oh why, doesn't this wonderful, family, heart-warming film appear on DVD? It is a gem for any day of the week. Ponti is a wonderful Pope (and I am Methodist).<br /><br />Please, pleeeeeeze, bring out in DVD format. My VHS format is old and yellow..... and fuzzy.
Wonderful movie of a young pope (for a pope) who feels he has become inaffective and sneaks off to find his way.
I was very thankful to find this movie. It's one of my favorites. Catholic or not, you'll enjoy this touching movie.
I had seen this movie many years ago and lost track of who had it in my family. I decided I needed to see it again. It was worth more than I paid. Rare to see a non-religious "religious" film. With warmth and humor the story of Pope Leo and the defeated village of Monte Petra reaffirms the value of elegance in story telling and the power of great and honest acting to move the soul. The humanity rooted in love, even when love can be a hard pill to swallow, can and in this case does, inspire. Tom Conti's character in very human,striving to cope with almost superhuman responsibilities. His "escape" to find his people allows him to find himself again...and his spiritual Guide. Enjoy this one with your family!
This is by no means a technically great movie, but I had seen it before and bought it anyway.  It's a sweet story, and Tom Conti does a nice job as a young and compassionate pope, fed up with the bureaucracy of his job, who accidentally gets locked out of the Vatican (in worker's clothes) with no money.
I am soooo excited that this movie is FINALLY available on DVD!  If I could own only 3 or 4 movies - this would definitely be one of them.  Heartwarming, subtle humor and a great story.  Catholic, non Catholic - it doesn't matter - you'll love the story.  Don't Miss it!
I taped this film from TV some time ago and have watched it over and over. It's funny and heartwarming. Conti and Giannini give wonderful performances.
A long lost gem, this is such a wonderful movie! Tom Conti is perfect as the Pope who's accidentally locked out of the Vatican and finds a purpose in helping a small town escape from the evil seduction of dependency on government handouts.
I Just finished watching SAVING GRACE,for the 4th or 5th time. A moving, funny, enjoyable and inspiring film with an incredible cast headed by Tom Conti, along with Giancarlo Gianinni, Fernando Rey, Erland Josephson and others. Who would have thought a movie about THE POPE could be this human. See it.
I am very happy with this purchase.  The tape artrived in good time.  The movie arrived in a nearly perfect box and the tape was also in very good shape.  I was very pleased.
I bought this for a friend because it is one of my favorite movies ever!
This movie will engage you from beginning to end. All of the characters are complex and each is very convincingly portrayed. It's appeal is not an overly sentimental presentation of the "old god becomes human theme." Instead it takes a man who happens to be pope and allows him to temporarily abandon the vestments of his position. The central character has all the flaws of any man and makes mistakes that in some instances result in trajedy. Tom Conti's performance is outstanding. His character is both passionate and sensitive but like the rest of us struggles to make the right decisions and take the best action. The results are not predictable. You will laugh and cry but above all else it will challenge your views of what constitutes good and evil. And in the end...(I'll let you decide).
All this time, I thought I was the only who loved this movie as much as you do.  I had a copy of this movie at one time and was so eager for my friends to see it, I loaned it to a preacher when he had surgery and I never saw the movie again and he joined the Navy and moved to Spain.  Ever since, I have been looking for this movie on DVD.  What a disappointment that it isn't on DVD.  Whenever I think of the movie, I can't help but smile.  It has such true meaning for humanitarian causes.  Please keep me posted when it comes out on DVD (if ever).  I am so glad there is a Saving Grace following!
This is a wonderful family film that is way too hard to find.  Video stores should continue to carry it.  I'm so glad to have this video in my collection.  Every family should.
Tom Conti makes this wonderful story of a young Pope who accidentally gets locked out of the Vatican, and makes use of the situation to mingle among his flock - a small Italian town, where he makes a significant difference.<br />  Heart-warming story.  But, more importantly portrays the human-ness and 'like the rest of us' nature of the Pope.
What a gem this film is! A true delight for the whole family! With lessons on morality, modest humor, and triumphant hope amid the struggle against oppression and despair, this film is a treasure to be watched repeatedly!<br /><br />The acting, writing, and direction are all excellent. The cinematography and location scenes are all beautiful! My only problem with the film is that its translataion onto tape caused it to jiggle on the screen. Maybe that's because the tape was used and old. I do not know. Nonetheless, when and if it comes out on dvd I intend to buy at least two copies.
I ordered the movie "Amazing Grace" with Tom Conti and Retro Rocket Entertainment has been excellent to deal with. they were prompt in answering my concerns and very good about helping me with my concerns. they are excellent to do business with and I would recommend them highly.
I rented this movie a couple of time a few years back. It is funny and a real faith builder too.  It is a shame that the film is out of print and was never put on a DVD.  In the meantime, I can still enjoy it on my trusty VHS player.  I strongly recommend that you scoop up one of the last copies of the movie still available
What a wonderful, heart warming movie. Not to be confused with another movie of the same name starring Craig Ferguson. Tom Conti gives an exceptional performance as Pope Leo who, inadvertantly, lives among the common people. What a movie! Great seller: immediate shipping and the tape is in great shape! Thanks a bunch!
I had been looking for this movie for a long time. I'am so glad I got it. What a great story.
