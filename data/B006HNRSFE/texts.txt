Manny Pontoriero's latest instructional DVD set includes two DVDs that offer outstanding instruction in landscape photography.<br /><br />As with Manny's earlier instructional DVDs, don't just watch a DVD once. Instead, watch a DVD, take a ton of pictures, and then watch the DVD again. Digital photography allows you to take many photos of a scene, from every angle, using different lenses and filters, with an immediate review of your efforts, and without the need for development as with film photography.<br /><br />The first DVD includes multiple sessions with Manny offering classroom style instruction that includes drawings and samples of a topic. Then, it is out into the field to use those principles in action. It is in the first DVD that Manny also explains Parallel Thinking. Parallel Thinking is `how else can I photograph this scene'? Don't just take the one picture that you initially saw. Instead, what other options (different times of the day, different seasons, using different lenses, etc.) can you use to capture the scenes at a location?<br /><br />The second DVD offers 14 sessions in the field at different landscape location along the East Coast. In each session, Manny offers detailed description of what he is doing at each location, along with why. Throughout those sessions are tidbits of information you might miss, yet are important. For example, if you are stacking filters on a lens use a step-up ring so you can use larger filters on a lens and not vignette your photo. Or, don't change lenses at the beach if the wind is blowing as you do not want to get sand grains into a lens or the camera; and, vacuum the lens and camera when back home to remove any sand grains on the outside surfaces.<br /><br />The second DVD contains a bonus 15th session in which Manny moves from the camera to the computer to briefly explain what changes he might make to a specific photo. He uses the raw editor of Photoshop to make those adjustments, along with the neutral density adjustment available from that editor.<br /><br />I highly recommend Manny's DVD sets, especially this two DVD landscape photography set.
I consider myself to be an amateur enthusiast photographer. This DVD set, like all of Manny's, are very informative. I enjoy his style of teaching and all the advice that he gives during the DVD. Landscape photography is one of my favorite styles to shoot. Once again Manny's many examples and differing locations made this DVD extremely educational. I have purchased all of Manny's Get the Picture DVDs and would highly recommend them. Thanks Manny!!!
Manny is an excellent instructor. I've been tinkering with photography since high school. Now, 50 years later, it's time to put down my typewriter and pick up my camera. Thank you Manny for the informative tips and excellent instruction. Now I can go from taking snapshots to creating photographs.
I purchased this DVD to go over my composition concepts.  I've been a landscape photographer for over 20 years.  I shoot mostly landscapes and sell them at [...]<br /><br />But there's always something new to learn. This program is beautifully put together.  I loved it!
"WOW what a great video set. I have several other videos by Manny and they are great so I knew when I saw this title was available I had to have it. Buy the set and you will turn your ordinary snapshots into photos with visual eloquence"
