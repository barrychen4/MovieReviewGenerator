For those who didn't know, and I was one of them, a Hobson's choice is a free choice, but where only one option is really available. At the end of Hobson's Choice, a fine, vulgar, poignant and very funny film directed by David Lean, this is what Henry Horatio Hobson faces. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed.<br /><br />Hobson (Charles Laughton) is a prosperous shoe and boot merchant in the small town of Salford, England. The time is the 1880s. Hobson is a widower, a blusterer, a man accustomed to his comforts, his drink and his ease. He is, thanks to Laughton, larger than life, a man we can laugh at but not a man we'd probably want as a neighbor. He has three daughters. Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) is 30. She is, says her father, "a bit ripe" for marriage at her age, and he plans to keep it that way. Maggie runs the store, keeps the books, sees to dinner and keeps the home above the store neat. Henry Hobson, or course, doesn't pay her wages because she is, after all, his daughter. His two younger daughters both have suitors, and that's just fine with him until he realizes he must give them dowries if they are to marry. There'll be no dowries from Henry Hobson.<br /><br />And now we watch Maggie come into her own. She is a plain woman with an iron will, a determination that recognizes no barriers, and a very shrewd mind. If she is ever to get away from her father, she will have to find a man to marry her. And now we meet Willie Mossop (John Mills), the shoe worker who makes the shoes in the dingy basement under the store. Willie is just about illiterate, shy to a fault, naive, slow, honest and with very dirty hands. He is quite satisfied to stay in the basement making shoes. In Willie Mossop, however, Maggie sees not just escape from her father, but a man who makes marvelous shoes, and a man she could make into a success with his own...their own...shop. She knows she can do this, and she'll find a way to secure dowries from their father for her two sisters while she's at it. It should come as no surprise that Maggie accomplishes all she sets out to do; that Willie becomes William Mossop whose shoes sell, who is endearing and honest and who has a far better haircut after Maggie takes charge. While Henry Hobson roars about, deep in the drink, full of self-pity and bluster (and as entertaining as only Charles Laughton could make him), we settle back and enjoy the sight of Maggie using her head, with energy and determination, to get the better of her old rogue of a father. Maggie not only finds Willie, but love, too. By the end of the movie, we've come to know a contented and successful couple. William and Maggie have given Henry Hobson a choice he would be foolish to refuse.<br /><br />This is a vastly entertaining and satisfying movie, thanks to Lean, Laughton, Mills and, especially De Banzie. Laughton came to loath De Banzie during the filming, and the reason is as plain as De Banzie's plain but attractive face. The movie ostensibly is a showcase for Laughton. He plays Hobson bolder than life, vulgar, squinting, staggering drunk, too smart for his own good...a man full of faults and foibles we can laugh at more readily than laugh with. He has two major bits playing the drunk or hungover Hobson and he's very good. There are two major sly and finagling scenes with him which are even better. But Brenda De Banzie, a marvelous actor, steals the show. Just as Maggie carries the day, it is De Banzie who carries the movie. Laughton must have realized this would happen during their first scenes together. De Banzie starts by giving us a no-nonsense woman who knows how to get things done. Her decision to make Willie Mossop her man, to marry him, slowly lets us see just a little vulnerability. She's not going to take "no" from Willie, she will make him a success, but we begin to realize without her saying a word that she wants Willie to not find her unattractive. Their wedding night and the morning after is played for smiles, but they're tender smiles. We realize that Maggie made a good choice in Willie and that Willie realizes just how lucky he was. Henry Hobson may continue to bluster, enjoy his drink, expect his comforts and make us appreciate Laughton's bits of over-acting, but it is Maggie and William we feel good about. Together, they're going to be running things...and successfully, too.<br /><br />The movie was released long ago on VHS tape and can still be tracked down. Criterion's DVD release, due in a couple of months, will undoubtedly give the movie the attention it deserves. I plan to buy it as soon as it's out and will add here my opinion of the extras. This is one of David Lean's finest films. Hopefully, the Criterion release also will bring more attention to what a fine actor Brenda De Banzie was.
I cannot even begin to descibe the tenderness, humor, and subtle life lessons in this movie. It cannot help but be entertaining and uplifting in the truest sense.  I have this on vhs...it is so worn from watching...I have loaned it to many friends who have said that in the first few minutes they are wondering why I love it so much, and then they are gradually brought to the point where they are enchanted with the sweet lessons of self-determination, true love, and the beautiful transformation of Willie as Maggie sees in him what even he cannot see. A man well treated by a woman does so much for his confidence....And as for maggie...How lovely to see the message that we make our own happiness in life.<br />  There are so many favorite moments, but i agree with the earlier review that Maggie(DeBanzie) steals the show. Nearly every scene with her in it contains my favorite moments  A random bit...but one of my favorite moments is right at the wedding supper...True love is seeing the good in our spouse and helping them believe it.  I also really like the snip of a scene earlier in the film when Willie realizes that he will never be going back to his old life and his sheer disbelief and joy.<br />  This is a sure winner with the quality of Miracle on 34th street, a  movie that will be watched over and over.  Treat yourself and buy on for your mother!
This is a great comedy from the golden age of British film in the '50s<br />by one of the all time great directors, dealing with the issue of<br />sexism and the British class system with a marvelous performance by<br />Charles Laughton as the self-satisfied, pompous boot shop owner (boots<br />are what they call shoes in England).  If you liked The Man In A White<br />Suit, Kind Hearts And Coronets, et al, you'll love this film.<br /><br />With the release of this film and John Schlesinger's Far From The<br />Madding Crowd on DVD I'm two films closer to having all my wishes<br />fulfilled.  I hope the transfer is O.K., but I'll buy it anyway.  Now<br />if we could just get The Jokers with Oliver Reed and Michael Crawford,<br />and all the other great overlooked British films on DVD.
I really enjoy David Lean films, and I watched this not knowing beforehand what it was about.<br /><br />I know the phrase "Hobson's choice" is Cockney Rhymming Slang for "voice"; and the phrase means to be given only one choice; the choice to accept what is offered or nothing at all.<br /><br />The story is about a retailer named Hobson who is a widower with 3 adult daughters.  One day he decides the two younger daughers are too silly and expensive to have around and so he becomes determinded to marry them off.<br /><br />The eldest daughter is very good at housekeeping and tending the family boot shop and so he wants her to stay; therefore he tells her she is an old spinster past the age to marry.  Well this goads her into taking fate into her own hands.<br /><br />We start to see a shift in the meaning of the title; perhaps its referring just as much or moreso for the eldest daughter as for her father.  I also like the moral lesson of equality offered for couples who are already married or considering marriage.<br /><br />The story kept me guessing until the very end, and I found myself falling in love with the story.  Its very well told and very funny but under the humor is this shining truth that persists and inspires me forward.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this film to everyone.  The message of story is certainly far ahead of its time, and still very relevant now.
During the middle forties until the late fifties, the British Cinema affianced itself as the most fertile creativity in which comedy genre concerns. At the moment to think about Kind hearts and cornets, The man in the white suit, Whisky galore, The Lady killers or The lavender Hill Mob, it results very hard to ignore it. These films were emblematic and every one of them carved in relief the humor was the exit door before the enormous process of moral reconstruction after the WW2. As a matter of fact, I'm certain that the corrosive Monthy Phyton team during the seventies and eighties, Bertrand Blier (Buffet froid) and the irreverent Cohen brothers during the nineties, found in these movies a lot of inspiration for their projects.<br /><br />Hobson is a devoted father (who knows like nobody else to share his filial love with the drink) with some flaws here and there, but he will do his best in order to make his single daughter (who is at the eve of the forties) falls in love and finally get married. But meanwhile, a funny set of hilarious events will undertake.<br /><br />Perhaps this movie is - essentially - the closest British Neo Realist ever filmed, combining the poverty with kind serenity and good spirits an urban fable, filled with gentle tenderness, candid humor and great doses of realism.<br /><br />Brenda de Banzie, Charles Laughton and John Mills are simply out of this world; everyone of them is perfect in the role. Amusing and entertained all the way through and one of my top ten desert island choices in this genre. Another striking evidence about the artistic height of the master David Lean.
The other reviewers have said most of what could & should be said about this wonderful movie, particularly the reviewer from San Antonio.<br /><br />Back in my married days my mother in law was from Liverpool. She had never seen this movie, but of course knew of the term 'Hobsons Choice' as do all Brits (a choice which, in fact, is no choice at all).<br /><br />I had recorded it on Betamax (this was almost 30 years ago) and had such a thrill at the Mother in Laws delight with this film.<br /><br />Anything David Lean touched was instant gold, and ditto Laughton (except for a relative dry run in his 40's films).  A particularly memorable scene is breakfast after the couples wedding night when Maggie has become docile and gives Will an adoring look and he seems ready to burst with pride at having performed his husbandly duties properly!  Great stuff.<br /><br />An equally great Laughton performance is in Witness for the Prosecution (dir: Billy Wilder) made in 1957, his next film after this one. His performance there netted his 3rd and final Best Actor nomination for the Academy Awards.<br /><br />And an early Lean masterpiece set also in England is Brief Encounter.  Try both of these as well, you will not be disappointed.
... by epic filmmaker David Lean. A "Hobson's Choice" is akin to Don Corleone making an offer one can't refuse. In other words it is no choice at all. How Hobson's eldest daughter takes advantage of circumstance in order to put her overbearing, alcoholic father in this position is fascinating to watch. There is no situation Miss Hobson can't handle with decisiveness and dispatch. She is her  father's daughter and has a great head for business. Dad has met his match.<br /><br />The great Charles Laughton has a flair for humorous depiction and his comedic timing is perfect as the bootmaker who underestimates his eldest because she is a useless girl. Brenda De Banzie gives a nifty performance as the eldest daughter. She has to manage a somewhat mean-spirited, stingy, father who likes the drink too  much, as well as her sneering younger  sisters who think she is over-the-hill and beyond the age to attract a good husband. Although she is uber competent, it turns out that she is warm and inviting as well. Prunella Scales shows her comedic skill in this early portrayal (she is best known as Sybil Faulty from the hilarious "Faulty Towers.") as the youngest Hobson daughter who is selfish, vixenish, and calculating. John Mills is really splendid as the illiterate, humble, sweet and expert bootmaker who Miss Hobson decides to make into her father's chief professional rival. The rest of the cast never misses the mark. My personal favorites are the Figgins with whom John Mills boards. In fact we can never picture any  other actors as the battling Hobsons and their friends and neighbors.<br /><br />All works out as it should in the end, resulting in a satisfying film experience. Hobson can be a silent partner in his boot business as long as he butts out, shuts up and stops drinking of course. Don't miss this little jewel of British cinema.
I just wanted to write to put a few people right.  'Hobson's Choice' is set in Salford, Lancashire (it is now part of Greater Manchester) which is about 200 miles north of London.  That's a lot in English miles!  I didn't think that many Americans would have heard of this great film and (as a Mancunian myself)I can't help but feel a sense of preposterous pride well up inside me just knowing that this film is so beloved on the other side of the pond. This film is wonderful isn't it? I don't think there are many celluloid moments that beat Henry Hobson's mortal terror of the moon following him, going home from the pub.  My favourite Charles Laughton performance:  "VICKY!! DINNER!"
The Victorian Era is at its height, and Henry Hobson is the master of his little world, tyrannizing over his daughters and employees, and spending hours at the pubs with his cronies. However, daughter Maggie is laying plans down for a future of her own, and they all revolve around William Mossop, Hobson's best employee. Now it's up to Maggie to clear the way for her future and those of her sisters, and she's definitely up to the job!<br /><br />This is a great movie, with a lot of fun and adventure. The actors do a great job of bringing life to the characters, making them seem as real as real can be, and keeping the story moving and fun throughout. This is a great story of life and love in Victorian England, one that I really like!<br /><br />(Review of Hobson's Choice starring Charles Laughton, Brenda De Banzie and John Mills)
I have been looking for this DVD for a while and was thrilled to finally find it listed on Amazon.  This is a real joy to watch. I watch it over and over. What a sweet story.
This is my new favorite old movie.  It's over fifty years old, and it shows a bit, but it's delightful.  As others have mentioned, a "Hobson's choice" is a choice that isn't a choice at all - at least, no more than "take it or leave it," if that.<br /><br />In the 1890s in Salford, Lancashire, England, the owner of the boot shop is a selfish, querulous, chauvinistic alcoholic who is overbearing with his friends, his neighbors, and especially his three daughters, who resent their father's treatment.  When he realizes he can't marry off his younger daughters without providing dowries, he decrees that they will remain unmarried and work - without pay - for him.  Those sisters are petty and self-centered, and only whine about their fate. However, the eldest - shrugged off as a hopeless old maid but an invaluable shop manager - takes charge of her life by picking a most unlikely husband for herself - her father's talented but ignorant bootmaker, Will Mossop.  When it's all done, her sisters are married to the men of their choice, Maggie and Will Mossop see success both in business and in marriage, and Hobbes is reduced to being a silent partner in his own shop because he is incapable of being anything else.<br /><br />The legendary Charles Laughton is an admirable tyrant.  His character's alcoholism would be treated much more seriously today; here he is made a comic character whose delirium tremens is funny.  But my favorite part of the tale is the development of the love between the "old maid" Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) and the mousy Mossop (John Mills).  He blossoms into a real person with the support (and direction) of the strong-willed, practical woman, and she softens with the loyalty and respect of the gentle man whose character is just the opposite of her father's.<br /><br />This isn't a major film, but it is a small jewel.  It's worth your while.
"Hobson's Choice" is a charming story of courageous decisions and personal growth, at the same time providing constant dollops of humor, along with the stark backdrop of industrial England.<br /><br />Henry Hobson runs a solid business making and selling boots and shoes, a widower helped by his three daughters. He's a bit of a Scrooge, preferring that his daughters suffer as old maids than he provide a dowry for them.<br /><br />His oldest daughter, Maggie, a matron in her late 30s or early 40s, decides to take on this situation head on and make a change. She picks out her father's best worker, a bachelor of about her own age, and suddenly announces to him that they will be married.<br /><br />The story of their unusual courtship, and Willie's (the renowned John Mills) personal growth from an excellent but timid craftsman to a confident and successful businessman - under Maggie's tutelage - provide the meat for the rest of the film. Charles Laughton is excellent as her grouse of a father. Brenda de Banzie, with a less recognizable name to the average movie fan, but a solid body of work herself, is wonderful as Maggie.<br /><br />"Hobson's Choice" is an amusing story of the triumph of spunk. Not for action junkies, for those who appreciate the stories in these older films its a treasure.
This was the first British film i ever saw, in West Texas not many of those kinds of movies get out this way, and i absolutely loved it!!!! Its got a solid and interesting plot line with a splendid performance from the actors. I don't need to tell y'all the plot because there are several other reviews that do so. but this one part is so comical, on Willie and Maggie's wedding night Willie is just about to go in to his bride and hes so scared to death he squares his shoulders and marches into the bedroom as though it were to his own execution but the following morning its like there is a new-found love between the two. I like this movie because instead of the typical "fireworks" romance but instead a gradual and a growing tender love between the two so that by the end of the film I believe Maggie has the happiest marriage of the three sisters. aside from the wonderful film's plot and acting, it is sooo much fun listening to them talk! I have never in my whole life heard anyone talk like that, it was sooo neat to hear what an English accent sounds like. I wonder if this was actually filmed in London? anyway it was definitely on the expensive side especially for a DVD but it was worth it for such a great movie!
Charles Laughton is the irascible Henry Hobson who owns a boot shop in 1890s England. Hobson dominates his three daughters, blustering and threatening them about their marriage prospects. His oldest daughter, though, takes matters into her own hands when she uses her own considerable willpower to marry her father's lowly and mild-mannered bootmaker Willie Mossop, played beautifully by John Mills.<br /><br />A quiet movie in many ways, but with many delightful moments. Watching the transformation of Mossop from meek bootmaker to proud husband and owner of his own shop is reward in itself. Watch for Prunella Scales of Fawlty Towers fame as youngest daughter Vicky.
This my all time favorite.  There are many more movies that I would love to own but Hobson's Choice is on another list...my must have list
This is a great old film set in London and starring Charles Laughton in a surprising comedy role.<br />Usually he would be expected to play the grumpy captain of a naval vessel.  Here he plays the part of an overbearing, drunken father of three daughters, the oldest of which he supposes will turn out to be an old maid.<br />However, she turns out to be totally self dependent and surpises both him and the sisters by charting her own future.<br />By the end she succeeds in convering the father from a pompous, dictatorial gas bag, into a humble dependent. She further converts her surprising choice of a husband from a mild mannered weakling into a strong, take charge type.<br />Overall a really interesting and entertaining film.
One of the most delightful movies I have ever seen.  I have been frustrated in not being able to find this on DVD.  Excellent service, and after the viewing, well worth the price.
Hobson's Choice is a 1954 David Lean film that I found totally satisfying by today's movie standards.  In Victorian England, widower Henry Hobson (Charles Laughton) manages a boot shop.  Actually, his three daughters and the boot makers in the basement do the work while he drinks at the tavern and trades stories with his friends, holding tightly to his authority as man of the house.  He's kind of a Victorian Archie Bunker.  It turns out that his oldest daughter (at 30, Hobson claims, she is too old to marry) has a mind of her own and convinces the best bootmaker in the basement to marry her and set up their own business -- a blow for feminism and to classism in one swoop.  Watching those two reach their potential and blossom into confident human beings is only one of the delights of this brilliant film.
My first viewing was some thirty or perhaps forty year ago. My youth deprived me of the appreciation I should have felt. A wonderful story that captured the customs and traditions of an island country that has given birth to so many great governments about this world. A social order that became a standard. Best viewed by an older and experienced person.
The story opens in Victorian England, where Henry Hobson (Charles Laughton) is a wealthy boot shop owner despite being a selfish blowhard who spends his days and nights at the pub.  When he tells his smart, spinster  daughter (Brenda de Banzie) that she's too old to marry, she takes matters into her own hands and marries an unlikely candidate (John Mills).<br /><br />This is an absolutely delightful movie with endearing characters, a funny plot, and witty dialogue and it was directed by David Lean.  Laughton is very good as the blustering father, but Brenda de Banzie steals the show.  She plays a strong-willed, ahead-of-her-time woman who knows what she wants and goes after it, despite the social pressures of the day.  John Mills gives a sweet performance as the oafish boot hand who grows into a confident and loving  businessman.<br /><br />The recreation of a Victorian town is complete and the costumes are lovely.  This is an old-fashioned and thoroughly enjoyable movie that will leave you wondering why they don't make 'em like this anymore.  Highly recommended.
This is a sweet/funny,comedy/love story.  Saw parts of it on cable and HAD to buy it.  You'll want to see this one!  Put it on your list of must have movies!
If you like the old British productions get this one if only to get a flavour of the late 19th century in London England.<br />Top British Actors all around.
This movie is very entertaining throughtout and has some very good life lessons in it. It came very quickly and was well packaged. This product is a bit on the expensive side for an old movie but I guess that is what you pay for when you get a classic.
This DVD is a classic; it's cinematography, it's acting and the story are all at the peak of a great artistic presentation.
During his entire career David Lean was fascinated by Victorian and Edwardian hypocrisy; this lovely little comic film from 1954, based on a 1916 Harold Brighouse play that had been filmed several times before, allowed him to show the lighter side of this fascination. Charles Laughton, in a great comic turn, plays Henry Horatio Hobson, a Salford middle-class bootmaker who drinks too much and who exploits his three daughters for their unpaid labor. The eldest daughter, Maggie (Brenda de Banzie), decides at the play's beginning to break free from her father's control by marrying his most talented workman (John Mills) despite their class differences and setting up shop together; the pleasure of the narrative is in seeing the confident, unyielding Maggie put everything to rights with her backwards lover (who initially acts as if he's been descended upon by a divine power beyond his ken), her father, and her silly sisters who have romantic interests of their own. (This is the same sort of pleasure as afforded by Stella Gibbons's novel COLD COMFORT FARM--seeing social disorder swept up and made tidy.) Though the acting styles of the film's principal actors are very different, Mills and Laughton have a great time with their more broadly etched characters and show their skills at playing broadly without going over the top; meanwhile, De Banzie has a genuine triumph of naturalistic acting with the single-minded Maggie, who is simultaneously estimable and fearsome but also quite warm and likable. As always David Lean makes tremendous use of mise-en-scene, and offers brilliant touches (the opening sweep of the fussily designed boots and shoes in the Hobson shop; the great windburst that showers the flyers for Maggie's shop all over Hobson after he tries to throw them away in the street). The wonderful exterior shots of the actual Salford streets (with carefully recreated signs from the period done up on the storefronts) show you a more particularized vision of 1880s urban Britain than you might ever hope to see anywhere else.
I have enjoyed reading the previous reviews and heartly agree with each one.  This movie is delightful.  Don't miss Prunella Scales (Fawlty Towers) as one of the sisters.  Watch it yourself and see if you don't fall in love with this film too.
I have the VHS of this absolute gem--or rather, I did.  A friend borrowed it to show his three young daughters and they watch it over and over, so I don't have the heart to ask for it back! Don't forget to show this to your kids, they will love it!
British Director David Lean, best known for blockbusters like Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, was about a decade into his illustrious career when he directed Hobson's Choice in 1953.  Hobson (Charles Laughton) is the proprietor of an English boot and shoe shop who leaves his eldest daughter Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) to run his business while he spends his days drinking at Moonraker's Pub.  Laughton's strong performance shows his talent for comedy, as well as a surprising physical agility that belies his age and girth.<br /><br />Hobson's two younger daughters may marry if they wish, but he has decreed that Maggie will remain unmarried, tending his shop and his home. The strong willed Maggie has other ideas, and finds in Hobson's prized bootsmith Will (John Mills) the perfect timid lump of clay to mold into a real man. Mills' performance as the subservient worker is a delight to behold as he hesitantly transforms under Maggie's goading and guidance into a reluctant approximation of a dominant man of business.<br /><br />The rambunctious musical theme that plays with the opening credits is a hint that this will be no ordinary comedy.  The three lead performers, along with an assortment of familiar British character actors in supporting roles, deliver a story that is likely to linger pleasantly in your memory for years to come.<br /><br />This DVD from Criterion has several special features, including a newly restored digital transfer, audio commentary on the film, an informative essay in the form of a booklet, and a BBC documentary on the life and career of Charles Laughton.
Set in nineteenth century, industrial revolution England, it is basically a love story, completely enjoyable, start to finish.  Brenda de Banzie, as a woman of character; John Mills, as an illiterate artisan; and Charles Laughton, as the blustery master, give convincing performances.  Well worth the money.
One of our favorite films and it will become one of yours as well.  The acting, storyline and filming make it a classic.  We once had a VHS copy of this film recorded from cable broadcast years ago - but I accidently used that same VHS tape to record something else and lost much of the original recording. We were heart-broken. Thank goodness, this classic film - Hobson's Choice was finally released on DVD. Add it to your DVD collection, you will be happy you did.  Enjoy.
I checked Amazon for this movie again, not even hoping, really, that it would be on DVD (something one does at two in the morning).  And, behold, it now is! This 1954 movie with Brenda de Banzie and John Mills is surprising and funny and leaves one feeling happy.
Yes, I know this is the title of a recent movie and it was pretty good but this movie, this movie is great.  There are really not that many great movies out there.<br />I first found this movie in my mother's (yes, my 80 year old mother who has excellent taste) collection of VHS tapes she made from PBS.  It was a miserable copy but the movie!<br />I ordered the VHS here on amazon and waited close to 2 months to receive it.  I have watched it unnumbered times.<br />I want to thank Criterion for doing a beautiful DVD version.  Charles Laughton is at the top (the very top, which is pretty high) of his game.  Brenda DeBanzie, who I never heard of before or since, is amazing as is an unexpected John Mills.<br />This movie is about love, faith, bravery and family, all the BIG subjects usually given turgid treatment but this movie is far from staid.  Ok, I love this movie (and I too have excellent taste).  So, stop reading these silly reviews and buy it, already.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE IN MANY YEARS. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES. VERY, VERY FUNNY. I LOVE THE BRITISH HUMOR.
Having grown up on the more well known films of David Lean, from his 1940s period pieces, like Great Expectations and Oliver Twist, to his famed epics, The Bridge On The River Kwai, Lawrence Of Arabia, and Dr. Zhivago, I was surprised to learn that he even made comedies. In fact, he only made two, 1945's Blithe Spirit, based on a Noel Coward play, and the film under review, 1954's Hobson's Choice (Lean's last black and white film), also based upon a play- a 1916 play of the same title by Harold Brighouse. While this film is not in a league with the aforementioned classics, it is a very good film, and often quite humorous; yet this is all due to Lean's direction and trimming away of some of the narrative fat from the play in favor of unique cinematic expression, starting from the opening shots that define the workplace of Henry Hobson (Charles Laughton, in one of his better late roles, after his career started a long, slow fade) to the many precise positionings of characters within the film frame, to the degree that many scenes play out as living detailed paintings from the very era the film is set in- the late 19th Century. One particularly well wrought scene comes near the film's end when Hobson's oldest daughter confers with a doctor about her father's condition, and instead of the camera following them for what will be a perfunctory exchange it stays with Laughton, who gives a bravura scene of underacted rage and calm in one.<br /><br />Hobson's Choice is not a highly regarded film in Lean's canon, and in comparison to some of the aforementioned classics, the reason why is obvious- it's only a very good film in a career littered with great works. But, it was recognized by the critics of the time, and won the 1954 Best Film Award from the British Academy of Film. The only negative in the film is the over the top burlesque music of Malcolm Arnold. Yes, the film is a comedy, but it's nowhere near slapstick. That said, it is also an enjoyable film, and dominated by the female presence in the film, a rarity in Lean's canon. A good film, an excellent ensemble of DVD features, and this bit of minor English film history becomes one of the better DVD releases in recent years. See for yourself, as it will soon be released to the general public. Now that's a choice old Hobson could live with.
I always love it when I can 'put to pasture' an old, faithful VHS copy of a favorite film and replace it with a crisp-looking DVD...so I can't wait for Hobson's Choice to hit the market.  My David Lean DVD collection begins with his two Dickens adaptations and ends with Lawrence Of Arabia.  The only holes in the collection are Hobson's Choice and Passage To India (which I won't bother with because it's the one David Lean film that I don't like well enough to own).  Now what we need is for someone (or a variety of someones) to lean beyond Lean and issue DVDs of the 2-part epic of Little Dorrit, starring Alec Guinness and Derek Jacoby, the original Monte Walsh with Lee Marvin and Jack Palance, and that other Charles Laughton gem, Ruggles Of Red Gap.  And while they're at it, it certainly would be nice to have The African Queen on DVD, wouldn't it?  But maybe that's too much to ask.
DVD of a Black and White classic film was delivered on time. It was of excellent quality and was enjoyed by my family this past holiday week.
Laughton is a bore in this one.  Always the same, never changing, no nuance.  A boring narcissist...  Mills moves a million miles in character, from totally subservient to being the man of his own house......and wife.  And for an English movie this is quite amazing as there is so much emphasis on keeping in one's own class.  Here in the USA we dont think of class as limiting.  So we miss that aspect of the story.<br /><br />Of the three daughters stuck with Hobson for a father, slave driver, as they work all day for no money when he just goes to the tavern and gets plastered.  The younger daughters are pretty dumb, but Di Branzie applies her brilliance at running the bootery to her own unfulfilled life.  She carefully plans and bends everone to her will.....and for everyone's benefit.  But most important, she brings Mills out of his tight cocoon and teaches him to have pride, confidence, and ......to love her.  He doesn't love her and says so, but that doens't stop Di Brenzie......she has it all figured out and has an answer for everything.  A super survivor.  Mills is brilliant as the changeling.  In fact, you hardly notice him early in the movie.  Then each little push to his self respect and self-sufficiency is a joy.

Typical understated British comedy, that grows on you.  Some over acting in places, but Michael Redgraves performance is spot on for the charicter he is playing.  If you like British comedy, and some I do and some I don't, I think you will enjoy Hobson's Choice.  Worth taking a chance on.
"Hobson's Choice," (1954), a classic British comedy, product of Shepperton Studios, runs a brisk 107 minutes in black and white. This feel-good domestic comedy was directed by the great multi-Oscar winning David Lean.  Boozy widower Henry Horatio Hobson (Charles Laughton--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PH9N2S">The Private Life of Henry VIII [1933</a>]) runs a successful boot shop in Salford, Lancashire, in 19th century Victorian England. Hobson is much too fond of The Moonraker, the pub across the way, forcefully dominates his employees and his three unruly daughters.  After he decrees `no marriages' to avoid the expensive matter of settlements,  the bootmaker's eldest, Maggie (Brenda De Banzie), and his star assistant Willie Mossop, marry and establish a rival business. (In his portray of Mossop, John Mills --<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SIMZPA">Dunkirk </a>, who generally played heroes in his long career, seems to be giving us an early take on his several later portrayals of village idiots).  At any rate, after her own marriage, Maggie turns her attention to helping her sisters marry their chosen suitors; Hobson is gradually forced to change his autocratic ways. The film also gives us Prunella Scales as Hobson's youngest, Vickie. (She was, of course, to win everlasting popularity later on, as Mrs. Sybil Fawlty, in John Cleese's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LFPAUC">Fawlty Towers: The Complete Collection Remastered</a>.  Remember, "Oh, I know, I know." At any rate, HOBSON, an understated, witty motion picture, won the  Best Film British Academy Award.<br /><br />Salford, an ancient, historic city, has, since Victorian times, been absorbed into Greater Manchester. But Lean gives us a good rendition of the city, its people, and its pulses at the time.  The film, to be sure, comes relatively early in the British director's career.  It follows on some of his noted black and white films, MADELEINE, OLIVER TWIST, GREAT EXPECTATIONS, BRIEF ENCOUNTER, BLITHE SPIRIT and the World War II pictures THIS HAPPY BREED and IN WHICH WE SERVE.  Later in his career, of course, Lean was to begin making the big-canvas full-color Oscar-winning pictures on which his reputation largely rests today: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADD5">Lawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition)</a> (1962),  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XPPC">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a>, (1957), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSXSM">A Passage to India [Blu-ray</a>] (1984), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LMPKSQ">Doctor Zhivago</a> (1965).  And <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBG5PQ">Ryan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, one of John Mills' finest village idiot portrayals within.<br /><br />Current-day audiences might not find Hobson's drunken antics, nor his delirium tremens, as hilarious as 1954 audiences were meant to.  We might be puzzled by an extensive scene in which the drunken Hobson chases the reflected moon in various puddles in the street--and what was that all about, I still wonder?  Just director Lean playing with his nifty camera?  But we might be inclined to stand up and cheer as Maggie, at 30 already considered a spinster, decides to marry Willie, and gets it done, despite all opposition, even from Willie.  She helps him carve out a successful career, too.  Well, aside from Hobson's drunken moments, the film is easy enough to take, and can be quite entertaining.  It's worth a butcher's -- a look.
