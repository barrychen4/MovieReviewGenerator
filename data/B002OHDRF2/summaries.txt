Terminator Salvation
Explosions, or how skynet meets transformers!
Gritty
Terminator Salvation
Great movie
Entertaining enough

Mindless fun, but leaves you with a lot of (pointless) questions...

Not bad, but still... the weakest of the Terminator movies!
I must for T fans
Liked the movie

The Worst Terminator Film to Date
The fourth film in the series. DVD.
I really liked this film. Most misunderstood film of the year?
Disappointment For the Longtime Fan...
The "Termination" of a franchise!
A Struggling Series.
Explosions, Explosions, and More (Explosions)
There is no Salvation for this Terminator flick
action ad nauseum
Terminate the franchise
A humdrum entry to a disenfranchised franchise
"This isn't the future my mother warned me about"
Shame on Fox and WB
The Alien vs Predator of the Terminator series.
A Worthy Addition To A Much Loved Franchise.
What a Waste of First Rate Talent and a Great Film Series
So much potential!
Superb
awesome
Loved it!
Great Movie with awesome actors
Better than I expected
Salvation from the Terminators!
great movie
terminator salvation
Made an excellent Christmas Present
Director's cut even better than the theatrical
Terminator Salvation: Fire (special effects) without much light
Terminator...the Rebuilding of a Franchise
The War For Survival Rages On...
A fresh rebirth with a new direction....
Loved it, no matter what others think!
It was a great movie!!
confusing and depressing
Terminated
Okay, but not the best.
one of the best terminator movies yet
Why did they bother to buy this franchise?
If you can hear this YOU are the Resistance
For those who love the series
Terminator Salvation....
A Worthy Addition to the Terminator Franchise
Not great, but better than I expected
this movie is action-packed from beginning to end.
Hope it terminated the series
This is a GREAT action movie
The best Terminator movie
Rehash of other films
Entertaining, and not the worst entry in the series, but not as good as you'd hope.
rememberable summer movie
Glad but yet also sad
Poor excuse for a Terminator movie and movie in general!
Terminator Salvation was a let down.
Weak.
McG destroys a perfect franchise (and my childhood)
Exquisite, Intelligent, Evocative Sci-Fi
Good Start.......For A New Trilogy
Was this supposed to have a plot?
Honorable end to a great franchise
Flimsy, Unoriginal, Forgettable Film...
Franchise Terminated
Why does McG keep getting work?
Director's Cut Differences
good movie, but not much to Director's Cut
Terminator Salvation Extended cut
An Imperfect, But Still Above-Average Summer Actioner
The best version, but still a bit light on features....
NO DIGITAL COPY
DVD EXTRAS? What happened to them? (*Good movie, better than T3, but not so good DVD)
Decent film, terrible DVD
The best Terminator movie since T2
Pointless
another solid movie in the series
great movie -- five stars!
Best of all the Terminator movies
ONLY FOR THE DIE HARD FANS
not nearly as bad as people say
Wasn't expecting to Enjoy it but I did!
Sour Disaster
No story means don't waste your time
Is this the best they can do?
Slow Delivery
Terminator Salvation
Ehhhhh
No fate
Con esta pelicula, se salv&oacute; la saga de TERMINATOR (por eso es que se llama SALVATION)
Better than the original, but not much added
Good Movie
My favorite of the series.
full quality
Admirable entry
"Pretty Good Sequel!"
The definition of bittersweet
WIll become a cult classic
excelent movie
Terminator Salvation
Terminator Salvation (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] by Christian Bale
GREAT MOVIE
Good Movie...Not Great!
Really enjoyed this movie
well done!
Redemption After Horrible T3!
A worthwhile effort but flawed
great movie
terminator salvation
Terminator Salvation review
Awesome
Terminator salvation
excellent service
Great Movie
That Terminator has more juice
DECENT MOVIE
Salvation
Good but not like t1 & t2
GOOD PLOT, GOOD ACTING, GOOD ENTERTAINMENT WHILE KEEPING THE PREVIOUS THEME IN TACT
Best McG movie ever but no director's cut
Terminator Salvation
Made a great gift!
Walks The Fine Line Between Paying Homage And Adding To The Cannon
5 for 5
Great!
pretty good action...
Good action movie
spans the time
Better the second time around; pretty on Blu
Hollywood should have consulted me....
like but not love
Actually a lot better than I expected...
Mindless Fun
A charitable 3 stars at that.
Nothing great, nothing horrible
Solid Movie
Waiting for a long time
A Futuristic Action Romp in the Terminator Mythos
Terminator: Target
Pretty Faithful To The Franchise Despite The Director
If only this movie had a heart as strong as Marcus Wright's
Great Action, Good Story
The Terminator? No Way. Good Flick? Totally
Back to the Future
What a let down!!
The real danger is in human beings
No Scene Selection, Can't Escape Previews & Ads
Not bad at all
Was This Supposed to be "The Transformers Got Lost in Time?"
There is a Skynet... and it wrote this movie
Not Cameron's Vision
Definitely second best of the entire series...
DVD gets hosed again!!!
I terminated it at 32:31.
A good sendoff to a sadly dead franchise
Dissapointing
Step up from Terminator 3?  Yesss
Lackluster Terminator outing
Man and machine battle for the control of destroyed Earth
i have few issues with this part
GOOD, GOOD MOVIE!  (plus confession...)
Good job McG
This makes up for T3
Continuity?  I can't find it here.
He loved it!!
Half-reboot, half-sequel, all-terrible
Ok
Bare Bones DVD
A Disappointmentator
Better than everyone told me it was
One of these things is not like the others...
Digital copy NOT w/ Purchase & Hard to Obtain.
a movie that lacks feeling, like the terminator itself
as good as T2
No fate but what we make
An Awesome Action Film!!!
Where they kidding?
I love Blu-ray, but don't force it on me to get the Director's Cut.
Entertaining with sloppy editing and storyline
Terminator: Salvation
They should really Terminate the franchise after this
Awesome!
Unless you're a major fan of the series, don't bother wasting your money buying the dvd.
All action, no heart
A worthy sequel to a great franchise..
Blu as it's meant to be
Did anyone making this film see original terminator?
Beating the dead horse
Zero stars and I want a refund.
Rent it (unless it's cheaper to buy it "previously viewed")
Now we're talkin'...
Finally, the Terminator setting we've all been waiting for!
Part Fallout 3, part Transformers, part Road Warrior = Terminator Salvation IMO
T4(Salvation) is in the right spot as the 4th movie
Factory fighting scene again
Total Rubbish, don't waste your money
Terminator "Lite"
Terrible....Just Terrible
A solid action flick that neither lifts nor sinks the Terminator saga
I guess I'm suppose to watch the new Transformers film next?  Could it be worse than the first one?
not a big fan of the first three
Director's Cut Offers Nothing!! * Some Spoilers in this Review*
Been a harsh critic in the past, but...
Hell of a lot better than T3!
Terminator Salvation
What was the point of the movie?
not what it claims
Great Audio and Video
Great movie.
TERMINATOR SALVATION
Terminator Salvation
Good Continuation
Good action movie for Terminator fans
good, but the series may be exhausting its potential
Good "extension" with a moving Worthington performance
Terminator Review:
Terminator Salvation
Not the story I expected!!
Movie review
Great movie, Worth every penny!
John Connor or Batman
Is it a prequel? Or a sequel?
"Win or lose, this war ends tonight!"
Great presentation for a mediocre film
THE BEST REVIEW
So Much Action - So Little Time
Excellent!
Compromised prequel/sequel in the "Terminator" saga has its moments and strong cast
Not the best
The Return of the Killing Machines
Surprised at how horrible this movie is.  Terrible acting, script and directing
Ugh
What an awful movie...
Utter B.S.
Great Movie
Worst terminator movie
POORLY LIT SCENES RUINS THE MOVIE FURTHER!
Sci-Fi
The cup is either half full or half empty......
The Best Terminator Yet!!!!!
Good action sequences... pity about the plot
No need to discuss the plot; it's absent
DVD release is a disaster
Terminate that Movie!
Been There. Done That.
leave it alone!!
best Terminator movie!
this is an awsome movie to see. a big must.
TERMINATOR SALVATION
excellent..best of the series
MOVIE
Not as good as the other 3
directors cut
Stick with the original two!
Horrible!
Why am I not in this movie?
Very good....but....
Terminator DVD  release sucks
You better be ready to pull the trigger........
"OHHHH GOOD FOR YOU!
James Cameron For T5?
An Awesome Action Film!!!
A complete letdown
what a waste
Terminator Salvation
waste of plastic
WHERE ARE THE BONUS FEATURES??? SERIOUSLY!
Terrible flick!
Lighten up folks, it's a popcorn flick
Save Your Money!
A very slick action film
the german edition is much better
A combonation of all 3 previous films in one and not in a good way
Didn't get it...
Way Out There...
Not Suspenseful + Not engaging and exiciting as Terminator 2
Great DVD
The weakest of the bunch
A Disappointing Continuation of the Series
Different DVD versions
A worthy addition to the Terminator series....
I bought the directors cut DVD at Target today.
AWESOME!
Excellent Video Quality
I am a fan so of course I enjoyed the Movie!
Director's Cut is pretty worthless
horrible movie
Epic fail.
This is what happens when...
Get the Terminator Salvation (Two-Disc Director's Cut + Digital Copy)
Special effects very nice but stupidity ruins the movie
Arrived early
Terrible Addition to the Terminator Franchise
Wow
Cuidado Brasileiros
Amazon Sent Me the Wrong Version
Boycott to this movie
OMG
lacking
ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE !!!!!!
Saw this down in Orlando, FL
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR
Ending... (No Spoilers here)
I like to call for a swap
Not the best Terminator movie but I will buy the BluRay
..
One Of The Worst Movies Of The Last 12 Years, Avoid At All Costs
GOD This movie SUCKED
Great movie, Great price
GARBAGE. IT MAKES T3 LOOK LIKE A MASTERPEICE.....
I hope this is not the end of the franchise
Action over substance
Terrific War Scenes and Fantastic Special Effects!
More like 3 1/2 stars...just sayin'...
Terminator Salvation
All right...
I Actually Enjoyed This
An average release for an average movie
WEAKEST OF ALL TERMINATOR FILMS
Awesome Movie
A movie worth owning
Exceptionable But Completely Different Feel
The Salvation of the T Series
salvation for some
One of the best in the series...
Good
John Connor Blah - Marcus Wright AWESOME
Where is your Salvation?
MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE!
The Dark side of John Conner's Mission
What where they Thinking?!
A mediocre sequel to the series, but not as bad as T3
machine killin' good time
Thought this would terminate my Terminator viewing...NOPE!
Terminator Salvation Review
Surprisingly good film!
Phenomenal 4th film
I doubt they will be back !
DVD Extras
An Awesome Action Film!!!
Not the traditional Terminator...but great anyway
There is no Salvation for this Terminator flick
First 3 movies great, the 4th an absolute disapointment
Terminator Salvation in Blue Ray Fails to Deliver HD quality
Not quite the train wreck I was expecting
Great new addition to the Terminator franchise
Post-Judgement Day Entertainment
Not much "Director's Cut"
Something to watch, but nothing to pay for
Not much personality to this flick...more like a video game.
Fairly Solid Movie Almost Ruined By a Poor Ending
Unusually good!
Terminator:Salvation  ( Blu-Ray )
Looks good less filling
great movie
salvation terminator
Give It Another Shot If You Didn't Like It At First; I Did And Really Enjoyed It
Nice franchise
Amazing story line with top notch acting!!
salvation
Terminator Salvation needs salvation
If you want action and suspense-then, here it is
Love Action
Mediocre but gritty
Respectable Entry
In Need of Salvation
Good movie
Alex
Almost...
Sadly lacking!
