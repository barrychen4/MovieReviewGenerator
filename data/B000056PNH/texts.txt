It's nice to see NBA Entertainment coming up with a DVD like this that focused on the unsung heroes of the NBA. Noteworthy are the little big men like Spud Webb and Mugsy Bogues, and other "6th man" overachievers in the person of Mario Elie, John Starks and Darrel Armstrong. They are the TRUE UNDERDOGS. Would have loved to see Robert "Big Shot Bob" Horry or Ben Wallace, an undersized and undrafted center that has become one of the NBA's fiercest defenders and perrenial all-star. Also included in the disc are the greatest upsets, namely Denver's demolition of 1st seed Shawn Kemp-led Seattle in the early 90s and New York's climb to the NBA finals depsite being an 8th seed and injury plagued. Must see for every sports fan.
I expected the unexpected and got just that... NBA Video explores the greatest upsets and overachievers in NBA history.  From the legendary championship run of the 1977 Portland Trail Blazers to the heroic tales of  Scottie Pippen and Kevin Garnett, NBA Upsets &amp; Underdogs recounts the  NBA's most inspirational stories.  Even with the odds stacked against them,  these featured teams and players, including host Bill Walton, have managed  to steal the headlines with their epic performances.  I was truly  inspired...
