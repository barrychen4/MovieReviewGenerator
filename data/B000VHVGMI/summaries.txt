Jack the Giant Killer DVD
Giant Killer
The DVD is the ORIGINAL version!!!
Family fantasy with scary creatures
"7th Voyage of Jack" entertainment worth the price!!
Not bad for (the price)
Poor Man's Harryhausen Film
GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS FOR THE TIME PERIOD
Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack ...
Generally sharp DVD
MATINEE MADNESS RETURNS
Charming Film, With Highly Variable Effects
Re-worked musical version ruins this SINBAD clone
Great childrens fantasy disc
Jack the Giant Killer was a Killer!!!!
Ain't no Harryhausen...
Not Free SF Reader
Surprisingly good!
Blast from the Past
JACK THE GIANT KILLER
Killed that giant!!
A disappointment in special effects
I loved it in 1962, and now my son does (but not my daughter)
...but the musical version gets 5 stars!
The non-musical version is godawful
Jack the Giant Killer  (Kerwin Matthews)
Same Personnel, Different Results
Faerie tales as they were meant to be
The Giant
We have failed master, we have failed.
What happened?
