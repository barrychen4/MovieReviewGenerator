A budget DVD released on Goodtimes homevideo (It used to be released on MGM). Picture quality of 'Jack the Giant Killer' is much better than the Vhs version (obviously) and about the same (if not better) than the Laser Disc release. This single layer disc runs 1 hour 36 minutes and is playable worldwide (NTSC). The movie stars Kerwin Williams &amp; the beautiful Judi Meredith and directed by Nathan Juran. There are no special features on this DVD except for scene index and play. The DVD is worth it even at this price. This is not the musical version but the regular movie version, The disc is made in Hong Kong (and/or Taiwan) as mentioned on the back of the DVD keepcase, but then again most budget DVDs are made there nowadays. The picture and sound quality is very good (Its the best I've seen of this video so far) and would get this classic before its too late.
Even if this is not as good as Ray Harryhausen at his best in "Jason and the Argonauts" and "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad", it is certainly as good a quality as the later Sinbad's he did. Anderson's creatures may be a little rough around the edges by todays special effects standards but it is still quite entertaining for the whole family. Most children will find it great fun. There are numerous monster creatures and several interesting good characters. Kerwin Mathews and the rest the cast do above average performances. The sets and music help draw us into this wonderful adventure fantasy story. If you like Fantasy movies you will probably enjoy this one. Did you miss the price on this DVD? Talk about a bargain! Even if you for some odd reason you didn't love it you could donate it to a good cause. I got the DVD and even though released by Good Times it is an excellent transfer. The picture and sound are great. Good quality DVD and replayability. Most kids will love this.
If you check my review posted below, you will realize that I am very fond of this flawed but fabulous film.  The GOOD NEWS about the DVD release-----it's the ORIGINAL version, NOT the putrid Musical re-make!<p>The Less-than-Good news is that the transfer (obviously from a print)isn't as crisp and contrast-y as one would ideally like.  In addition, it's a bit disappointing to realize, assuming this realease is authorized, that MGM/UA is not interested enough in this film to release it on their own, and thus has licensed it to Good Times, a serviceable, but second-rate outfit.<p>Oh, well---guess I shouldn't complain.  It's just GREAT to have it in the DVD format.<p>Oh yes,.....the SOUND on the DVD is fabulous--bright, clear, dynamic, crisp.<p>And, incidentally, I bought and watched Harryhausen's &quot;7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; recently.....great, awesome stop-motion work, of course (I remember seeing it in the theatre in early '59----I was literally shaking with excitement and terror simultaneously!  Had to go out to the lobby to regain my composure as they were climbing through the hills of Colossa looking for the Roc's egg!  Subsequently had cool dreams of the cyclops chasing me on the beach!....)<p>BUT----HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT-----I'd still prefer &quot;JACK&quot; ANY DAY!  It's so much more human and engaging.  Watch the scene after Jack has killed the first Giant and the King asks him<br />&quot;Have you seen the Princess&quot;......it's so charming----nice acting, beautiful music (you catch a bit of the doll's music box dance transformed by the orchestra under the dialogue...), then we meet Jack's mother, touchingly played by Helen Wallace...things like this just add so much to the enjoyment of a fantasy film.<p>And the SET-UPS!!!....despite some of the crude visual quality---the experimental angles and odd shots which they used....shots from above the giant....dropping the rope around his neck...the bucket of flour in his eyes, his falling and nearly crushing Jack...the 2-headed giant about to deliver the &quot;coup-de-grace&quot; to the sea serpent with the anchor when Sigurd (in dog form) saves the day by jumping on the giant's back to distract him, while Peter (in chimp form) tosses rocks on the giant, in order to give the serpent time to revive from his beating......the harpy hovering over the ship, swooping, diving,  ascending with the animated Jack on his back, the duo-death-dive into the sea with Jack and the Harpy side-by-side--------NO WONDER the film went so far over budget and took so long....these were incredibly COMPLEX SHOTS being done by a bunch of guys who were practically making it up as they went!!  There is NOTHING this<br />daring and spectacular in &quot;Sinbad&quot;;  just lots of straight-on shots, impressive though they may be.<p>But I do go on.........
Jack The Giant Killer is a great family fantasy movie. I've never seen the musical version, but it sounds like a hideous botch-up, and I can't believe people are disappointed because this DVD is of the original version and not some re-hash that had nothing to do with the production's original intention.<br /><br />I think the film is excellent just the way it is. It's the tale of a simple farmer (Jack) who gets caught up in an evil wizard's plans to abduct a beautiful princess to be his bride. I've heard it said that the musical version was created to tone down some of the film's more frightening moments, and I can see why younger childeren could get nightmares after watching some sequences. There are several such scenes. Early on in the film, the princess is having a party and one of her birthday gifts is a miniature dancing jester in a musical box. Creepy enough to watch as it is, this ugly thing comes alive after dark and grows into a hideous giant demon. In another scene, ghostly flying witches descend on a ship to try and seize the princess, who is being smuggled away to a secret location to protect her. This sequence, involving some very freaky apparitions, genuinely frightened me as a child, especially the moment when the ghost in the guise of a skeleton in a wedding dress surprised the princess in a small dark cabin. Eek!<br /><br />The animated monsters are of variable quality, ranging from the enlarged music box demon (the best) to the sea serpent that appears near the end (the worst). Maybe the money started to run out towards the end of the film! But the plot is engaging and never dull, mostly involving Jacks battle with the hammy but evil King Pendragon who has designs on the princess and is sending all these monsters to kidnap her, but also involving sub-plots such as the part where the princess is turned evil by a spell from Pendragon and almost double-crosses Jack - until the spell is broken.<br /><br />All in all, tremendous fun. Yes it does look a bit dated now, and a lot of kids aren't going to be enthralled this easily any more, but it can still give an hour and a half's worth of solid entertainment.
ASIN# B000050SKH<p>I gave this film 3 stars based on "the Film" because...<p>-It was such a blatant band-wagon move after "The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad".  It's hard to watch without noticing parodies.<br />-The giants inexplicably all have goat's legs, just like the cyclops in SVOS!!<br />-Same director and lead actors as SVOS...  in the SAME ROLES!!!<br />-Some scenes drag on, even action scenes!  "let's show more monsters LONGER!!!"  The witch scene on the ship NEVER ENDS!!<br />-A little magical helper, just like SVOS.  He even makes the same bargain for his freedom!!<br />-Battle between giant and serpent, just like SVOS battle between Cycplops and Dragon.<br />-Editing is silly at times.  Senes were obviously cut (gaunlet hall has arms cut off and blades broken but not a clue how it happened!) while others go on... and on... and on.....<br />-Acting is valiant considering the script!!  This thing was obviously thrown together.  I particularly enjoyed the high-school acting of Judy Meredith.  Kind of like watching a car wreck... you just can't look away.<br />-The monsters are extremely crude in every aspect, from sculpting to animation.  The funny thing is, the animation seams to get a little better as the film rolls along, like they created the sequences in script order.<br />-Jim Danforth (though I never see his name on the Credits?) needed to understudy under Harryhausen a bit longer.  He had very little knowledge of human or animal physiology.  This made his creatures look cartoonish and less believable.  Do you like shiney monsters?  To his credit, they definately have character.<br />-Despite all of this, it is a fun film.  Just need to get over the SVOS "cloning".<p>  As a value priced DVD, I'd have to give it 5 stars.  Here's why;<p>-Picture quality is better than could ever be expected for this obscure film (at this price).  Someone in Hong Kong must of had this on ice!!<br />-Ditto for sound quality.  As good as could be expected for a featureless DVD.<p>-Packaging is better than adequate.  They actually Screened a nice image on the disk!<br />-NOT THE MUSICAL!!!<p>Given all of this, I'd still recommend this DVD for Harryhausen Fans.  It really puts his skills in perspective.  It is also a whimsical and enjoyable movie in it's own right.  I just could not get over the "Sinbad" thing!!
The good news about this DVD release of Jack the Giant Killer is that it isn't the musical version!<br />The movie was shoot with a release to television in mind.Producer Small intended to light the scenes way to bright and was composing for a little frame.Therefore someone can forgive its full frame presentation and the transfer from a good videomaster.<br />This movie is a rare find and still fun to watch if you love classy stop motion. (...)
I don't mean to berate the great Jim Danforth, but this is an extremely low budget rip-off of The 7TH Voyage of Sinbad. The legend is that producer Edward Small turned down Harryhausen's pitch for 7th Voyage. Ray went to Columbia, and the finished product was a huge hit, making 12 mill in America alone in 1958!!<br />Small probably kicked himself a few times, and decided to make an exact duplicate of the film at MGM. He hired the same director (Nathan Juran) and same stars (Kerwin Mathews and Torin Thatcher).Unfortunately, the animation models were not of the quality of Sinbad, and the stop motion is rushed (Small had a very tight budget. The result is a fun film for kids, but fantasy film fanatics do not regard this as a classic. Jack (Mathews) must rescue a possessed Princess from an evil sorcerer who wants to take over the Kingdom.<br />Columbia actually sued Small for ripping off Sinbad, and the film remained in limbo for many years. In the late 80's, MGM turned the movie into a musical!!!!!! They dubbed over dialogue and made it look like the characters are singing! This version was shown on the Disney channel for a few years, and it is a sight to behold. In the mid ninties, MGM restored the film for a VHS release, and now the "widescreen" DVD. There is some controversy regarding the films original aspect ratio (see stopmotionanimation.com).<br />Kids will enjoy, but stop motion fans regard this film as a footnote in history.
This is a great little film with stop motion animation (pre-CGI) that deals with magic, sorcerers, fearless heros with viking and a leprechaun. A favorite of mine as a kid with great performances by the &quot;7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; cast, this movie is a family film that can be enjoyed by all ages.
Giants and monsters to slay ... what more could a lad on the farm ask for in order to prove his manhood? Handsome Kerwin Mathews is engagingly vigorous in the title role; Torin Thatcher appropriately evil as the magician Pendragon; Judi Meredith nonexistent as the trophy princess Elaine; and Walter Burke goose bumpy as a scurvy knave. Colorful fairy tale costumes and sets enhance the production and there are enough monsters, spooks, and creepy critters to satisfy even the most jaded appetites. I liked the farmyard escapade and the shipboard adventure best. A fun flick for a rainy Saturday afternoon.
The DVD is free of blemishes and is quite colorful; however, some images are pale, no doubt due to the aging of the original materials. This is especially apparent in composite shots where the models look bright but the backgrounds don't. Probably the best this film is going to look.
God bless Kerwin Mathews.  Not really all that great an actor, his dashing looks and his sincerity were the foundation for a series of wonderful &quot;fantasy&quot; films of the late 50s and early 60's:  &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,&quot; &quot;Three Worlds of Gulliver,&quot; &quot;Warrior Empress,&quot; and this little gem.  Undoubtedly not as marvelous as Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation, Howard Anderson's little creations are fun and imaginative, given the time this movie was made (1962).  Torin Thatcher is appropriately hammy as Pendragon; Judi Meredith was ingenuishly funny as the princess, especially in her hammy witch sequences; Anna Lee was appropriately British as the betraying witch; and Walter Burke was delightful as the dwarfish aide to Pendragon.  The dragon teeth soldiers are hilarious; everyone seems to be having fun and it can be said, they don't make movies like this anymore!  Relax, have fun and a lot of laughs!
One of the true treasures of my childhood, I saw this again as an 38 year old and had much the same feeling.  This is a good one, with a few significant flaws.  First, hopefully, I'm not the only one...but I found the princess MUCH more attractive and (yes) sexy after she was changed into the yellow-eyed, green-skinned evil incarnation.  Maybe it was the tighter dress, but she really did it for me, especially considering the &quot;nice&quot; princess was so vapid and bland.  <p>As for the effects, they were also mostly charming.  The harpies attack on the ship to steal the princess was actually frightening!  As for the stop motion effects, by Jim Danforth, they were amatuer at best, crude at worst.  It's no wonder he never stepped out from Harryhausen's shadow.  <p>Still, in all, a good film!
After the successful release of Ray Harryhausen's special effects extravaganza 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD, producer Edward Small decided to clone the idea and hence JACK THE GIANT KILLER was born.<br /><br /><p>This movie  copied SINBAD's style in every particular, and the result was, while not  nearly as polished as Harryhausen's film, entertaining in its own way.  It  was a major box office disappointment, however, and the studio decided to  &quot;save&quot; the movie by RE-EDITING it and ADDING SEVERAL SONGS and a  MUSICAL soundtrack.  This essentially ruined the movie for all but the  kiddies' market. Sadly for collectors, the musical version (recently aired  on Disney Channel) is the one issued on this videotape. I'd hold out for  the original if I were you.
Ordered this film for my children, having seen it on TV about 4/5 years ago. My children adored it, they are 7 and 4, and have watched it 3 times in 4 days.<p>A bargain, even after trans-atlantic shipping.
I remember seeing this movie back in 1962.  I was 8, my little brother 5.<p>He was so scared by the movie that it gave him nightmares two nights running.<p>He wasn't the only one.  Stephan Arngrim (Barry Lockridge from the &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;) said it scared him half to death as well!!<p>Rumors have it that it the reason the musical version was released was to make it less scary!!!
Lower your Harryhausen-like expectations and you'll be pleased with this fantasy adventure.  Nowhere near the Sinbad series but the transfer looks good for a disc of this price....
Very loose adaptation adds bikers, bogles, bogans and more.<br /><br />Definitely an archetypal example of the urban fantasy novel, if a bit lighter and more fairyish than some of the more recent examples.<br /><br />Here, Jack is a girl, and she gets involved with the world of Faerie after he boyfriend gives her the arse, and taking a friend along for the ride ends up having the usual sort of experiences that you would expect if you ran across faery bikers and other such oddities.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5
My husband has always loved this movie, I had never seen it. I bought it to watch at his birthday "Fantasy Fest" movie party.<br /><br />I thought it was going to be spectacularly awful, I was not mistaken. Nevertheless, it was one of those movies that is enjoyable despite the faults. I was surprised to find that I really liked it. It is very much in the same realm as Ray Harryhausen movies like: The Clash of the Titans, and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. Considering that this movie came out before those, the stop-animation is really good.<br /><br />If you liked the aforementioned movies, or stuff like The Sword and the Sorcerer, Hawk the Slayer, and the Archer, you'll probably like this one. And if you don't, it's also fun a la Mystery Science Theater.
I remember seeing Jack the Giant Killer when I was young on a saturday afternoon movies channel.<br />Its a little corney, but for its time, it was a well done flick, Brings back old and good memories!
THIS MOVIE IS AS GOOD AS IT WAS WHEN I FIRST SAW IT IN 1964 OR 1965. MY BROTHER AND I WENT BACK AND SAW IT AGAIN. WE EVEN SAT THROUGH THE "B" MOVIE TO SEE IT TWICE IN ONE DAY.. I NOW HAVE HAD AN OPPURTUNITY TO WATCH IT WITH MY GRANDSON, WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE JUST A SMIDGE OUT OF DATE,BUT GOOD.
Super reviews for both product and delivery!!  Thanks for caring and packaging the DVD for travel!!
Jack the Giant Killer could be considered an adult version of an old English fairytale, Jack and the Beanstalk "Fee-fie-foe-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman", or Walt Disney's delightful 1947 movie version Mickey & the Beanstalk.<br />Jack the Giant Killer is more about Boy meets Girl, Boy saves Girl, Boy falls in love with Girl and I'm not sure if they live happily ever after.<br />Although the Producer Edward Small hired Director Nathan Juran, the handsome hero Kerwin Mathews and the villain Torin Thatcher from the similar and very successful film the 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), it lacked the most important ingredient, the genius of Ray Harryhausen, master of the motion picture special effects and most famous for his brand of stop-motion model animation.<br />The monsters and fight scenes in Jack the Giant killer are laughable and hardly interesting. A disappointment!<br />Some of the favorite Ray Harryhausen movies that can still be enjoyed today are: the 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000062XE5">The 3 Worlds of Gulliver</a>(1960), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JDRG">Mysterious Island (Widescreen)</a> (1961), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767810864">Jason and the Argonauts</a>(1963) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKO7">Clash of the Titans</a>(1981)
I must admit that I was not as impressed with this as I was when I saw it at a birthday party in 1962.  It is not so much that the special efects were crude, but that it was so monochromatic in terms of characters.  Of course, in the eye of childhood memory, there were images that lived in my mind:  the giant getting its hand crushed in the grain press, the leprican whose bottle prison burned "liers" who touched it, and the torch-holding arms on the castle walls that turned into sword-swinging defenses (with no diminution of light).<br /><br />But then, this is a film totally for little kids.  Bad guys and monsters are ugly, the hero and princess who falls in love with him are beautiful.  So my son (6) was extremely happy and excited to see it, laughing and running around the room grabbing himself.  However, his older sister (10) found the effects "fake" and the story "rather silly".  She suffered through it, occasionally smiling.<br /><br />This tells me that this film is for those who can still suspend their disbelief and get swept away in their imagination.  For them, I would recommend this warmly.  For others, well, bring a book along.
This poor-man's "Seventh Voyage of Sinbad" is not without it's charm, but the bizarre musical version is the one to find! Sure it's a mess, but WHAT a mess! If you're a fan of strange live-action children's musicals like the K. Gordon Murray Mexican releases ("Santa Clause", "Little Red Riding Hood Meets The Monsters", etc.) then you'll want to track down the musical version for this movie. Luckily I have my copy that I had taped from cable tv in the early 1980s.
I am a huge fan of the musical version of this film.  It is so deliciously bad that it completely won me over... I found it completely captivating--I was horror-struck and yet completely fascinated by the songs--a curious concoction of faux-opera (think &quot;kill the wabbit&quot;)--interspersed with the cornball melodrama.  I have no idea why the musical version has fallen into disrepute... the humorless non-musical version will bore you to tears--it is no fun at all.  Until they release the MOST EXCELLENT musical version of this film, do not buy this!
This should have been a better quality production - not sure why it failed to entertain...
Although the film stars Kerwin Mathews and Torin Thatcher, both from &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; and is directed by the same director  of that film, Nathan Duran, this is a much weaker film.  The stop-motion  work is nowhere near as polished as Harryhausen's and the score by Paul  Sawtell pales in comparison to the brilliant Herrmann one for the earlier  flick.
Jacky Rowan has just ended a bad relationship. Soon after, she witnesses a murder. When visiting her best friend Kate Hazel the next day, Jacky is sure of nothing except wondering what in her life is real. She is about to find out.<br /><br />The only proof of what she saw: a red cap belonging to the murder victim, and a mysterious Harley rider not even Kate can see. Soon both women find themselves caught up in a quest that becomes more real than either imagined. Monteal in October transforms into the faerie kingdon of Kinrowan in the weeks before Samhaine.<br /><br />Spurred on by the enigmatic Gruagagh, Jacky, Kate and the hob Finn must rescue Lorana, daughter of the Laird if Kinrowan They are aided by the faeries Arkan and Eilian- and Jacky's magical name. Those insistent bikers constantly appear to put a stop to any effort. The girls have stumbled(?) into the perpetual battle between the Courts of Faerie.<br /><br />This is one in a series of retellings of fairy tales put out by Ace Books. While De Lint's storytelling is in keeping with his talents, still it is a retelling of two basic tales. There were a few nice additions (Judith), and a resolution that I did not anticipate. Best of all, this is how Faerie should be portrayed: dangerous, ambivalent and always with consequences. Disney did not invent them.<br /><br />"He closed his eyes, not to shut out the sight of what lay in front of him, but to seek counsel inside. He let his inner turmoil rise and fret, caught each fear and loosed it from inside him like so many freed birds until only silence lay there, deep and soothing. And filled with possibilities. They lay like threads in front of his closed eyes, going every which way, unraveling into pasts and presents and times yet to come. He couldn't work them, couldn't weave them, that was for other hands more skilled than his,but he could take one thread, one possibility, and tie his need to it, then send it forth from his silence like a summoning call."
This product arrived in good time and condition. This product draws attention to hte fact that you don't need to be a giant to be a winner.
I grew up and loved the musical version of this film as shown on the disney channel.  I was disappointed to learn that only the dry and humorless version has been released on dvd.  The masters at GoodTimes DVD made a crippling mistake and failed miserably by not making this version the musical version.  This version of the movie is not worth the mere $4.95 that it costs here.  The layer that the music adds is priceless...I watched the musical version of the movie with my girlfriend, and it was like falling in love all over again.  You don't get that feeling from the original version.<p>I'm planning on doing my own transfer of the musical version from VHS to DVD (for personal uses only, sorry guys, you're just going to have to wait until they come out with the musical version.  I bet you're jealous.)  I'm also going to add a special feature that will allow me to loop the songs over and over again, and I'll be singing &quot;a spectacle&quot; until the wee hours of the morning.  Non-musical version=1 star.  Musical-version=5 stars.
How utterly disapointing... I had no idea that there was a non-musical version of Jack The Giant Killer.<br /><br />Terrible acting, awful costumes, lame plot,  without the songs this movie is a drabby bore.  The goofy songs are the key to this otherwise DULL movie.
