Prime dreck from the Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC); MISS V FROM MOSCOW is a fascinating wartime thriller, filmed in 1942, which briskly plays out it's 66 minute running time and manages to entertain thoroughly.<br /><br />B-movie queen Lola Lane plays Russian spy Vera Marova (code-named `V') who adopts the persona of murdered German agent Greta Hiller and goes behind enemy lines into occupied Paris to glean top secret military information.  Her life in constant peril, `V' infiltrates Nazi headquarters and wires back the vital information to Russia before her cover is finally blown . Glorious B-movie nonsense from PRC, the most notorious of the `Poverty Row' film companies.<br /><br />Lola Lane is a delight and her spunky, ballsy heroine holds together the whole film nicely.  A former Warner Brothers contract player, Lane found her greatest role in 1937's "Marked Woman" opposite Bette Davis before finding a profitible career in Poverty Row features like this.<br /><br />Alpha's print comes from a good quality video master; the picture is sharp and well-defined for the most part and the sound is clean and audible throughout.
In his milestone volume B MOVIES (Curtis Books, 1973), Don Miller titled one of the chapters "MISS V FROM MOSCOW and Other Disasters: PRC," and went on to note: "[MISS V] may well be one of the worst movies ever made by any standards, certainly the worst movie of its year...but for students of bad cinema, the film is a classic."<br /><br />Of all the "Poverty Row" studios of the 1940s, PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation) was considered the bottom of the barrel. Even the folks at Republic and Monogram looked down their low-budget noses at this impoverished operation. Alpha Video offers several PRC titles, from their relative best (DETOUR, THE DEVIL BAT, STRANGE ILLUSION) to ones only for the terminally curious (SPOOK TOWN, TORTURE SHIP). When a PRC film is bad, it's as bad as a motion picture can be. But sometimes, when it's REALLY bad, the result is a rare sort of glorious ineptitude. And that's the best way to describe the strangely fascinating MISS V FROM MOSCOW.<br /><br />This World War II would-be thriller hits so many wrong notes that the effect will be mesmerizing to B-movie fanatics. Because she bears a striking resemblance to a Nazi spy, Soviet secret agent Vera Marova (portrayed with stern determination by former Warner Brothers contract player Lola Lane) is sent to infiltrate the Gestapo in Paris. Amidst variable Russian accents, stock footage of Adolph Hitler, and a German countryside that looks suspiciously like Southern California, our Miss V thwarts a Nazi plot to destroy an American fleet headed to Moscow.<br /><br />It's very easy to pick on a poor, defenseless little film like this. It was simply one of hundreds of low-budget programmers that were ground out as quickly as possible to serve up as fodder for movie-hungry wartime audiences. But the fact remains that MISS V FROM MOSCOW is such an unintentional hoot that it's far more enjoyable than many other pictures of this type.<br /><br />Ironically, Alpha Video's copy of MISS V FROM MOSCOW is one of their best-quality prints of a PRC movie (if only THE PHANTOM OF 42ND STREET looked this good). All the more reason why B-movie addicts should seek this one out. Love it or hate it, there's no other wartime thriller quite like it. Thank goodness.
Miss V from Moscow was better than I feared it would be although it does have its limitations. The acting by Lola Lane is actually pretty good although some of the other actors could have been more convincing; you can indeed tell that this is a "B" movie from a "poverty row" film studio. Unfortunately, Alpha Video has done little to help this aging film; the sound quality is average at best. In fact, I had to pay close attention to hear every line because of the white noise in the background that interfered with the soundtrack. Most of the sets are not bad but some of the outdoors scenes have terrain that looks almost precisely like Southern California; and the suburban area surrounding Paris, France certainly didn't look that way back when this film was made.<br /><br />When the action starts, Russian spy Vera Marova, aka Comrade V (Lola Lane) is assigned to impersonate a German spy named Greta Hiller during World War Two in occupied France. (The Russians are also taking advantage of the fact that the Germans don't know that the real Greta is dead.) A Commissar in the Russian counter-intelligence agency gives Comrade V information about Greta and a French two Franc coin which actually contains her only sign to the Allies that she is actually a Russian counterspy instead of Greta Hiller. Comrade V gets across German lines and enters Paris where she meets and begins to romance Colonel Wolfgang Heinrich (John Vosper) even though other German military men continue to have their doubts that she is the real Greta Hiller. Nevertheless, when Comrade V shows Wolfgang a cigarette case personally given to Greta by Hitler himself, Wolfgang falls for her ruse and they begin what he thinks is an actual affair; but of course Comrade V only wants him to get information about German plans--which are then transmitted by Doctor Suchevcky (Richard Kipling) to Moscow. Comrade V is also helped by the elderly resistance fighter Henri Devallier (Paul Weigel) and an American, Steve Worth (Howard Banks).<br /><br />Despite the fact that this movie is a mere 66 minutes, there are actually a fair number of twists and turns in the plot and there's even some suspense when Comrade X is suspected of being a Russian spy by the real Greta's housekeeper Minna (Kathryn Sheldon). Eventually things come to a head and it's anyone's guess how or if Comrade V, Henri, Steve, Doctor Suchevcky and others will manage to survive.<br /><br />If you like the actors in this film you will enjoy the movie despite its flaws. I also recommend this film for people interested in World War Two dramas. Sure, it's far from being the best World War Two drama I've ever seen; but it's not all that bad either.
