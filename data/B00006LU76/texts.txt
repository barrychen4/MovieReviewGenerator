First off. This comes as a DVD-R not a pressed DVD, so incompatibility might occur on some DVD Players.<p>That being said, this is DVD rip of a VHS master. It's ok, it's basically the fundamental of Wing Chun. Not very good in the details. No chapter stops. I believe it's only 30 minutes long.<p>I would say that the cost and quality exceeds the value of this DVD.
The DVD cover looked good online but it is nothing more than a inkjet printed cover.  Poor audio.  No structure on topics covered.  Nothing more than a home video with the Master and his students demonstrating some aspects of wing chun. Could be better but for now really poor show.  For the price I paid for it, simply not worth the money.
If all the martial arts DVDs I buy were as informative as this one, It would<br />be a perfect world. The footage is historic, so for overall quality, I give<br />it a 4.
I have been searching for an informative Dvd on Wing Chun basics and now I have found it.  This is some of the best footage that I have seen of this style.
Good Info for the money, Quality is OK but not great , Master Goldberg has a very good understanding on what wing chun is all about
