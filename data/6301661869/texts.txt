A grade &quot;B&quot; western that deserves a &quot;D&quot; grade. It showcased a Tab Hunter as a young cowboy with a cocky attitude, but Tab was 35 by the time this western was made and in some cases he looked it. However there was excellent character interplay between Hunter and George Montgomery and Yvonne DeCarlo. The crooked railroad commissioner was a blowbag and played to the hilt. For a gang of cut-throats riding in a prison wagon on their way to Huntsville Prison, at times, they seemed like a cheerful lot. John Russell's portrayal as the inept brother trying to save his doomed brother from a hanging was awful. Two stars
Hostile Guns is a hoot ! Between George Montgomery and Tab Hunter in their scenes together,you might think something could be going on.Add in Yvonne DeCarlo as a love interest between the two men and it gets wild ! Her false eyelashes set  this cheapie western firmly in 1966 when it was filmed.I particularly love  it when George calls Tab "kid" and he's at least 35.In fairness to Tab he never looks bad in a film.
