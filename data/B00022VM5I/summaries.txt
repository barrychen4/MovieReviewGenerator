The inefabble human intolerance!
Is that all!?!
a double feature
Powerful moments inside sloppy script
explosive and extrodinary
An appalling waste of talent.
Big artists, mediocre work
its' alright
a very confused theme
Oh, Mr. Hopkins, we'll never have enough of you...
This movie BLOWS!
I really tried
The Human Stain
This dvd is defective!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
POIGNANT THEME, GREAT ACTING, COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENT
Phillip Roth's Final Trilogy Tale Comes To Life On Screen
The Heartbreaking Chaos Of The Human Condition
An odd way to tell a story about racial prejudice...
Good movie (if you're expecting a mediocre one.)
A Moral Stupidity
A Brilliant Film That Stands On Its Own Merits
The intransigence of comfort
Engrossing, but...
Strangely intriguing.
of course, it doesn't stand up to the novel
Interesting plot-driven character study
Underrated and Powerful
Amazingly bad
Mixed bag or results, but interesting and good!!
Love in winter
Having Read the Book I wanted to Satisfy My Curiosity About the Transfer to Film
Great drama, but not a suspense.
Slightly Flawed Film Boosted By High Star Power
Intriguing and complex but uneven and miscast
Too much star power for this quiet movie.
Wonderful film
uneven though interesting film
2 Hours of My Life Wasted
"How far would you go to escape the past?"
AN IMPORTANT FILM, WORTH REPEATED VIEWINGS
Disconnected
Theme and performances: Excellent. Movie: Less so
Outstanding performances, odd storytelling NO SPOILERS
No Oscar nominations?
Intriguing Theme That Needs More Careful Casting
A Powerful and Masterfully Done Movie
Must See!!
Leave the "Love Story" out.
Watch for the flashbacks, not the present
Just a touch draggy...and a bit too vulgar for my taste
A special though tragic film
Human stain...
Phenomenal
Peak performances
Very  enjoyable film
Close to the bone
Compelling in flashbacks
Outstanding!!
To Escape One's Past.
Flawed but Interesting
No, No, No!
Excellent adaptation of a great writer
Intriguing but disjointed
knowing who you are
One of the Greatest Dramas on Film
Revives memories if you&#65533;ve read the book; otherwise, beware
Great movie! Very original
A Beautiful, Haunting Tragedy
great cast, fantastic acting, subtle but effective story telling
Good Movie
Great performances
Worth a Rental
Effective novel adaptation
The Human Stain
An Unraveling Life...
Stained in the blood of a whole lifetime...
recommended only for to fans of character dramas
Moves you along
Even More Intimate on DVD
Yes, It's A Stretch, But Very Thought-Provoking & Fascinating
Could have been better
The old goat
Too good to have been an American hit in the theatres.
Too many ideas, cluttered but worthwhile
Like celery you have to have an aquired taste for this ...
Morality Play
Well acted, but less than the sum of its parts
Read the book instead
What's the range of your sense of tragedy?
This Movies Illustrates the Stain on American Society
Terrific
See This Film For Ed Harris' Performance
A Strained Stain
5 Human Stain Hopkinisms

Self-racism leads to suicide
Good movie, but...
It's Stained Alright
