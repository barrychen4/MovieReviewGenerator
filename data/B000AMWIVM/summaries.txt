GREAT,GREAT,GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!
Saw enough
Thank God It Isn't PG-13!!!
Sick, twisted, and awesome
"Saw" Cuts, But Not Deep Enough
ending could have been alot better
Best of the series
This movie is for retards.
A Rare Breed Of Movie
Saw It and Liked It
Maybe I just missed something in the translation...
a disappointment
If this is what passes for great horror these days...
Taut, tense, fresh entry into a tired genre
How much blood would you shed to stay alive?
"I Sawed The Best Minds Of My Generation"
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
Disgusting, Disturbing And Sick!... But Pretty Good.
Cut and paste
Saw
Extremely brutal - Seven is Sesame Street compared to this
Isn't it funny....
Bad Acting and Excessive Gore Weighs down intriguing premise
good but not great
Very Disappointed
"Are you going to watch yourself die tonight?"
I  SAW  SAW
This movie has the best ending ever in a horror flick.
What was cut...?
Interesting cerebral horror flick..... *** 1/2
Modern Horror Classic!
A unique and very intriguing horror flick: ****1/2
A flawed, but intensely scary piece of horror
Gory, violent, suspenseful, and an ending that ruins it
This movie you have to get..........Now
WAY Better than Expected!
Very good..........BUT....
Yet another lame attempt
BEST SUSPENCE MOVIE SINCE SEVEN!!
This movie is awesome...
A review of both the film and DVD edition
Package Problem
I want to play a game!
The SAW series
gross
SAW...to experience or enjoy, that's the question.
"Anyone Care To Play A Game?"
"I've Given Your Life a Purpose"
Bloody but good!
Saw 4 is a goo scary movie and a 4 star DVD
psychological delight
SAW
SAW
First in the series is an absolute must
2 stars out of 4
gave me the creeps
I believe them limbs are me
Bloody!
Cuts to the chase
Great horror movie, full of shocks & twists
A question
'induced nausea' as an artform!  inspired brilliance!
See SAW
GREAT
Caution!! you might have to think to understand this movie.
Question
Plenty of thrills and chills!
SHARP SAW
Are you grateful to be alive?
An Excellent Horror Flick
The beginning
nothing special
The "Jigsaw Killer" plays another bloody little game
The Beast is Disease, blood is merely a symptom
Believe the hype
A Horror Classic
very frustrating
Good Novelties and Surprises. Weak story. Mildly scary.
The Flaw of `Saw'
not for the light hearted
It Had Potential...It Really Did.
Grind
Great Movie, with a great twist
A Scary Thriller That's Loaded With Twists and Turns
Mind Blowing Thriller!
And the moral of the story is........
Saw
live or die!
Saw delivers the goods with a killer ending
definately in my 'Top 10'...
Saw gets the saw......a good premise but it doesnt add up
Better than most of what passes for horror
Great plot for a horror film
See Saw!
I was never one for movie reviews
Better as a Whole
great movie
one of the best horror movies ive seen
Ridiculous
Please...
I want you to make a choice...
gag me, kill me, do something to put me out of this misery
"SAW"s Other Horror Films To Pieces...
One Shock In The End Doesn't Cut It
Not since Resevoir Dogs...
A puzzle missing a few pieces
Certainly not as good as its made out to be
Had nightmares after
Saw...saw what?!  SEVEN wanna-be....
a rare film for me
cool case, decent movie, funny commentary
Saw
orignal was much better....
Why oh why does everyone pick on Cary Elwes?
lossy audio and mpeg2 -- pass on purchasing until a re-issue
Dark, gritty, disturbing, gruesome; takes the best of the genre and adds a nice little twist...originality...
THANK YOU JAMES WAN-YOU ARE CLEVER!
The Best Serial Killer Movie Since Silence of The Lambs.
Every puzzle has its pieces
A Collage of previously seen footage.
Let's Play a Game
saw uncut
Be careful...
Little Indie film that satisfies...
One of my Favorite Movies!
Scarriest horror film I've ever seen
Finally, a horror movie to write home about
'Saw' A Suprisingly Smart Horror Yarn...Uncut Even Better
Suspenseful
Saw
YES!! IT KICKS!! MAKES MY LIST!
Gory Goodness!
Saw  (2004)
An amazing psychological thriller!!
In the right direction...
A good movie
See "Saw"
I Saw.......
Saw WILL Mess With You!!!
Prepare For The Ride Of Your Life
[Hilarious Saw Pun]
Great Thriller!
careful, this movie may surprise you
Different from what I expected
A little something for the gore hound in you...
Eh...
It could have been better
Starts out more promising than it ends.
Good Story, Great Execution
Johnny boy has done it again, this time it's a scrubber
Keep you guessing till the very end...
A DAM GOOD HORROR FILM
the best movie released in 2004
One twisted ride!!!
Disappointed (2.5 Stars)
Saw...So Bad it Should Be in Detention...
I laughed out loud
Avoid
Great Movie, Horrible Picture Quality
A Missed Chance
A Short quiz to help you decide....
Such an INSANE MOVIE!!!!
Repent, or be Punished
Absolutely brilliant
Another "Grand daddy" is born
A Newer, Bolder, Inventive Franchise . . . .
Cool Idea
I was expecting a bigger saw
saw saw and like what i saw!
great ,bloody movie
I love fear on your face...
Entertaining but a little overrated...
original. just this one, though.
A good horror film with an interesting premise, but flawed nonetheless
Edge of your seat thriller
And This Was Only Their First Movie???
Looked good in the previews, anyway...
The "Jigsaw Killer" plays another bloody little game
Come on kids...
The most disappointing film of the year.
Saw I - Bloody breath of fresh air
Mind @%*%
Modern day thriller doesn't  compare with the classics..
An O.K. thriller, nothing great.
If You SAW It and Liked It, You SAW What You Wanted To
Great story concept!
Like Hitchcock On Crack
Twisted, wicked, dark, and fun.
This SAW has Teeth!  Bzzzzzzzzzz!
Nothing Special
good for Halloween, after that, loses its luster
The first true horror masterpiece of the 21st century
Horrifying doesn't even begin to describe it.
You Cannot Call This A Film, The Premise Has No Purpose!
A Movie For A High School Drop Out,AshamedThat I EvenSaw It
Okay folks, say it with me-- this is not a horror movie.
ONCE AGAIN, LIONGATES MAKE A GREAT HORROR MOVIE!
smart clever  twisted , without explanation but who cares?
SAW
To really see Saw, you have to watch it again and again
"A Thrill Ride"
I highly recommend the SAW movies
Excellente!
Been to long waiting for a good film
A Gem
Brilliantly sick and twisted...if you can stomach it
BETTER THAN YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE!
An awesome new horror-thriller classic now better then ever on DVD!
Just Barely One Cut Above the Rest.
Don't saw sawdust
He makes them kill themselves at their own game
Awesome Movie
See Saw.
How much blood are you willing to shed...?
Didn't quite have me riveted to the screen...
Grotesque movie with an interesting story...
OK but not great
3 & a half
brilliant
Very original!
Not bad
Incredibly underrated!!!
Excellent Movie
Ending is awesome
True creative chaos
A THRILLER THAT DELIVERS!
Freaky
Saw - The double meaning is killer
Stellar Film
Promising but a bit amateurish
Saw...See It!
Not perfect, but basically a good horror movie
3 AND A HALF....NOT 5 BECAUSE OF CARL EWLES
Saw it, liked it, but would easily forget it...
I went, I "Saw"..I hated.
Cut off Your Own Foot Instead...................
A Big Disappointment
Oh no there isnt as much blood as you'd expect, o well, still good
A great movie
A MUST TO WATCH FOR ALL GORE/HORROR FANS
Nice
One of the best twists in a movie ive ever seen!!!
Best Thriller of the Year!!!
Game of Death:Thriller with Good Premise, Inperfect Result
0 [........] Star's

A real hoot
Saw "dust"
This film is just bad....
Fast Service!
Live or Die ? Make Your Choice
_ S_A_W_  .....not your typical murder movies.....
Wow!
One of the better horror films of this time
ONE OF THE MOST WELL THOUGHT OUT HORROR FILMS OF THE DECADE!
One Sick Movie Which Is Supposed To Be "A Psychological Thriller"!
It doesn't get much better
its gorey
What Would YOUR First Movie Look Like?...
Great
Heck Yeah! Must See!
Original and disturbing
Wait...its good?
Great movie!!!
Whew - very disturbing movie - loved it!
Scariest ive seen since Seven
Gripping but gory thriller/horror film
EXTREMELY VIOLENT YET MORALISTIC AT THE VERY SAME TIME
Squandered Potential
Great movie, disappointing Blu-ray
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you, not any more...
How much blood would you shed to stay alive?
See Saw.
I liked it!
This is entertainment!
For those who want more of the same.....
O.K Movie
SEE-SAW
A cut above the average.
nice and gory
Well done thriller overall, with one terrific perfomance.
Comes real close to being a classic, but...
Sick, twisted,  and FUN!
BY FAR ONE OF THE FREAKEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN EVER!!!!!!!!!!
Good Flick
Delving into the human psyche.
A rather intriguing and innovative horror flick
only seen bootleg of internet but it was awsome
A great horror title !!!!!!
Mind Rot @ Its Most Blatant!
This one belongs to the razzies....
What do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror?
Can you say masterpiece?
I WONDER IF THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CAN HACK THESE GAMES.
" let the games begin"
Great movie
The best somewhat recent Horror/thriller
Wish I hadn't seen this...
SAW it and LOVED it.
ITS THE RULES!
DIRTY, GRIMY, FILTHY AND ORIGINAL
Eh..
Some praise for a movie which hands down deserves it
"Saw" is badly overated
Looks like a made-for-tv movie
Not as great as everyone says..
BRAVO!!!!
I just SAW the worst film of the year......God that's awfull
Classic
Did you see what I Saw?
Blood, Guts, Poor Ending
FREAKY
This movie is a waste of your time
Impressive

Saw Rocks
3.5; it's a great attempt that falls short
4 Stars for a very valiant effort
Saw is Life...
A big gore-fest.
Finally a horror film that makes you think
Good idea, bad acting
This movie got me  revived!
"He helped me"
Amazing. Suspense.
Another low budget horror flick that works.
Different
Sadistic  fun
Perfect in concept, though flawed in execution
Not great, but cool twist you won't see coming
See Saw?
A great film
Raw and creepy...ending will freek you out
You'll Never Guess The Ending....
This psychopath could give Hannibal Lector nightmares.
Lions Gate Film brings another MASTERPIECE !!!
Top of the line thriller
Nail biting, keeps you interested from start to end
Ok what's the matter with it?
bad acting by main character, but excellent story makes up
ITS GREAT BUT NOT MUCH GORE!
Awful
When awful is not a strong enough word
It's OK
good, but the second is better
I  bought it because of the packaging
Clever and scary as hell!
Worth the Full Price of Admission
Horrifically magnificent.
You have to See Saw
HORrorS DE OUVRES ..............
I Thought, So What If The Main Characters Die.
What WOULD you do??
SAW: I'm sorry, but WOW!!!

Tight budget but great
Gripping, Intense
You Must See Saw.

Awesome!
Just taken from other movies
Excellent Plot
A Grisly Film with Few True Frights
Intriguing, if gruesome movie
YOU WANT SCARY AND UNSETTLING - THIS IS SCARY AND UNSETTLING!!!
Better than "Silence of the lambs"
Saw is a original horror that will really scare you
This is NOT a Bad Movie
What a waste of time
Waste of time
The absolute worst way to spend time
Waste neither time nor money on this crap

One of the Scariest Films EVER
So classic and so creative.
A Cutting Edge Film
Surprising entertainment

SAW IT TO THE LAST INSTALLMENT
Setting the bar very high !!!
A true horror classic...
Great Film, One Of My Favorites
The Golden Era of SAW!!!
great movie
Start of something great
Let the Games Begin...
No Gore
Very good picture & sound
Wow - That was a surprise!
Best of the 3 Movies...
excellent
brilliantly twisted
A MAZE OF NIGHTMARES
One of the biggest surprises in films
Forget about Freddy......Worry about Jigsaw!
pretty good, but the gore comes in way after it should have.
Lots of blood and a Plot!
DEFINITELY WORTH MY TIME
Intense Stuff
Great Movie!!
Good, Clean, Scary Fun
Entertaining, But Not Much Else
Don't get trapped in the men's bathroom.
Not bad, but not really that good either.
A wolf, caught in a trap, will chew his leg off to escape
More of a "crime" movie than a horror movie
Not horrible.
Slightly hacked off
I was too scared NOT to see this movie.
Genius!
Uncut?
excellent story and gruesomely satisfying scenes!
Bloody and Brilliant, Hampered by Acting
Offers some scares but more than anything is a rip-off
Me Saw...... Me like........
Bone Chilling
