I bought these videos for my niece for her birthday because she is like a little Shirley Temple. I was a little worried since they weren't animated like her favorite shows she wouldn't be interested in watching them. I was however happily surprised as she watched in amazement and danced around the living room.  I also had no idea when I ordered these videos that you can watch them in black and white or in color which I think makes them even better!
My husband and I both love all Shirley Temple memorabilia and were excited to receive Vol. 2 of her movie collection.<br /><br />The quailty of the CD's was exceptional and the pricing was much better than we expected.The product was shipped quickly and we will definately order again as we expand our collection.....A must have!<br /><br />We would highly reccomend it to all Shirley Temple fans.
I got these for my Mom to give to my niece for her birthday.  She is dancing to Shirley Temple in her dance classes.  She LOVES them and watches them constantly!!  It is wonderful that these classics can literally be enjoyed by the generations!
I bought these Shirley Temple DVD's for my granddaughter for Christmas. She's 6 years old and she thorouly enjoyed them.  They brought back so many wonderful memories for me also.<br />  I love shopping through Amazon because everything comes to my home rapidly and always in excellent condition
Above average quality of film remastery and colorization.  I am a pleased consumer and would recommend this product for any one who remembers, or wants to share 'curly top' with someone who didn't get to see her movies.<br />Shirley Temple movies were something we looked forward to every Sunday afternoon growing up here in Detroit (Michigan).  Enjoy!
I purchased this mainly for when my 8-yr.old granddaughter comes over to<br />give us a break from The Beverley Hill Billies which she absolutely loves!<br />We both are enjoying these. We have not seen them all yet. They arrived in a timely manner in good condition.
In mint condition, as advertised.  Shipped promptly.  A great collection of classic Shirley Temple movies.  A "must have" for fans of America's Sweetheart, Shirley Temple.
Growing up - we watched these movies. Now I share them with my family and they are still as enjoyable today as they were back then. Shirley Temple is truly an amazing young star. And, with our economy in the slumps - as she did in the depression era - she brings a little happiness during this recessionary time.
I have at the moment two box sets and they're both excellent. A revelation! The colour is faultless and is certainly the best enhanced patented process I have ever seen. All in keeping with the wonderful Shirley, her storylines and cast. What a blessing. I encourage anyone with a brain to buy any Shirley items, and look forward to buying more
The 3 movies were such bad quality, they were difficult to watch. Bright Eyes was so bad the entire film "jiggled". They had the look of pirated films.
The three sets of DVDs I had you send to my daughter and her family were extremely well received.  The relatively fast delivery along with the quality of the DVDs themselves, at least the ones they viewed thus far, are indicative of the good service I've had with Amazon in past purchases.  I plan to continue as a customer for books and DVDs.<br /><br />Joe Schweyer<br />Indian Harbour Beach, FL
I grew up watching these Shirley Temple movies. It was refreshing to see simple...well acted movies without a political agenda. You don't have to watch nudity or hear swearing.
Bought this for my daughter and she loved it.  Great quality.  You can pick if you want to watch it in black & White or Color.
My family enjoy watching these movies. I feel they will be watched for many years to come. Product arrived good to go. No viewing problems.
This box set contains three of Shirley Temple's all-time classic hits.  Depression era audiences adored the antics of this talented moppet, now we can introduce the magic of Shirley to a new generation of fans!  Includes:<br /><br />BRIGHT EYES:<br />Shirley Temple's first big movie, tailored especially for her, in which she plays the darling of a group of aviators. Shirley Blake (Temple) is a little tomboy who loves to hang around the airport with her pilot godfather 'Loop' (James Dunn). Her widowed mother Mary (Lois Wilson) works as a maid to the snooty Smythe family, where Shirley must contend with bratty Joy (Jane Withers). When an horrific accident leaves Shirley orphaned, 'Loop' sets out to adopt her but soon discovers he is only one of many who want to take home the adorable moppet.  Shirley shines in her first big role; Jane Withers is hilarious as the antithesis to Shirley's sweetness ("There ain't no Santy Claus, 'cause my psychoanalyst told me").<br /><br />BABY TAKE A BOW:<br />Shirley was reunited with "Bright Eyes" co-star James Dunn for this lighthearted caper comedy.  When little Shirley Ellison's (Temple) ex-con father is accused of stealing expensive jewels from his employer, Shirley runs to the rescue!<br /><br />REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM:<br />Despite it's title, REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM is not a re-telling of the classic Kate Douglas Wiggin story.  Temple plays Rebecca Winstead, a young radio singer who is discovered by talent scout Tony Kent (Randolph Scott). There's only one hitch: Rebecca's frosty Aunt Miranda (Helen Westley) who isn't about to have her niece go into showbusiness!  Shirley is surrounded by some of her familiar co-stars (Jack Haley, Gloria Stuart, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson); and the musical score includes "Happy Endings", and "Come and Get Your Happiness".
I just love her.. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas to add to her collection and she just loved it. I too have all her movies, plates and dolls and much more.<br />The movies are just wonderful and just enjoy the good old acting and singing.
I have always loved ST movies and this collection is very good.  I want to get every set so that I'll have all her movies one day.
These were purchased for a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves them, it makes her very happy too watch them, so I love them also.
ordering this was fast and easy,the person that took my order was very nice and sweet to talk to.I recieved my order quickly and in excellent shape.Thanks Amazon.
I ordered this as a gift for a little 4yearold girl, she<br />loved it and the color was pretty good compared to what<br />I thought it would be. Happy with my purchase
My wife is a long time fan of Shirley Temple and was so thrilled to receive these wonderful remastered movies.
This is a 3-DVD set featuring everyone's favorite 30's childstarlet, Shirley Temple. Included in this set is Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm(1938), Bright Eyes(1934), and Baby Take a Bow(1934). Each movie is encased in its own DVD keeper.<br /><br />Each movie has an option for subtitles in english or spanish as well as the original black & white or a new colorized version. There is also a spanish audio option for Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Baby Take a Bow. Theatrical trailers include Heidi(1937), Dimples(1936), and Little Miss Broadway(1938).<br /><br />Great set of beloved Shirley Temple classics to be enjoyed all over again and restored to its original pristine condition. Additionally, these classics can be enjoyed with an improved colorized version on a modern DVD format. Rejoice, Shirley Temple fans.
I got the DVD s in excellent condition. They work really well... no problem at all
I bought this movie for my mom at Christmas time. She really enjoys her movies.
