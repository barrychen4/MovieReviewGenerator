I was completely surprised by how much I enjoyed this film which was well-written and professionally produced. I found Brian Hasenfus, the actor in the leading role, to be particularly compelling and likable and his characterization of a man/child on the cusp of assuming adult responsibility touched me deeply. Not all goes according to plan, however, as temptation in the form of a sexually enticing high school student who is trying to make her inattentive boyfriend jealous ultimately derails the protagonist's plans in ways he could never have anticipated. The atmosphere of Philip The Fossil is pervaded by alcohol, cocaine and huge doses of steroids which converts a seemingly placid suburb in Massachusetts into a simmering recipe for disaster. Shot in an effective verite style with a great deal of edgy editing, the film is absorbing and suspenseful and I was sad to see it end after being treated to only one hour and thirteen minutes of highly creative film-making.
I watched this movie to use as a source for my new book on age-discrepant relationships and ephebophilia and it was a score. Here's a rough plot summary, without spoilers, as it pertains to my research:<br /><br />Phillip the Fossil (2011) - In the opening scene, 29-year-old Phillip (Brian Hasenfus), who won the SXSW 2010 Special Jury Prize for Best Performance, had anal sex in a car with a 16-year-old, who he absolutely could not believe had never had anal sex before. He was introduced to the teen by football prospect, Sully, in exchange for steroids. Subsequently, Phillip began a relationship with, Summer, Sully's 17-year-old spurned ex-girlfriend. On Phillip and Summer's first date, Summer performed oral sex on Phillip while he drove his pickup truck after they sniffed cocaine.<br /><br />And those scenes occurred within about the first thirty minutes of the film.
