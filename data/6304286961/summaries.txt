Head Trip
you decide
"The Doors"  Light Up the Screen.......
mostly reviewing the new features
GREAT PICTURE & SOUND!
"Does Anyone Really Know?" ~ Shamanic Excess And The Lizard King
Similar contradictions and problems I have with most of Stone's movies...
This film ONLY shows the 'wild,' spaced-out, abusive side of Jim Morrison
Accurate?  Who Cares!
A Great Movie
A Comic Book Version of A Unique Talent
Stoned--but not exactly immaculate
Get Stoned!
worthless, with the exception of what Kilmer and Meg Ryan do here
Incoherent, negative, and not really about THE DOORS...
"Change the mood from glad to sadness"
Although I live in the subconscious, our pale reason hides the infinite from us
Surprisingly tedious
a must watch for everyone born under the sun
If you like The Doors or Jim Morrison stay away as far as possible from this item

fine movie.  if only jim could have been here to portray himself
Long, Boring, No Focus on Music
Bad DVD quality

Don't Judge Until You Understand The Facts!
Unreal. Its really about Jim, and not the Doors however.
Wild Child
