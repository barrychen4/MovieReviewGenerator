This is a very dandy package of two movies: &quot;Till The Clouds Roll  By&quot; and &quot;Suddenly&quot;. A series of Hollywood Classics featuring  two movies of famous selected stars. When it comes to Sinatra, it is quite  open to question why &quot;Till The Clouds Roll By&quot; is selected while  there are some other more obvious Sinatra classics such as &quot;From Here  To Eternity&quot; or &quot;The Man With The Golden Arm&quot;. Sinatra  appears only once as many stars in &quot;Till The Clouds Roll By&quot; and  sings &quot;Old Man River&quot;. That's all you can see Sinatra in this  movie. If you want to see Sinatra in all scenes, you should buy another  movie.<p>&quot;Till The Clouds Roll By&quot; is a Jerome Kern (famous song  writer) biopic. Interestingly, Dean Martin was supposed to take part in  this movie but it did not realized. Otherwise, it would be the first movie  Sinatra and Dean Martin co-stared together.<p>Compared to &quot;Till The  Clouds Roll By&quot;, &quot;Suddenly&quot; is much more interesting movie.  Sinatra plays an assassin in this movie. After he learned that Lee Harvey  Oswald had watched this movie before he shoots  president Kennedy, he  withdrew the movie along with the other assassination movie called  &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. A Sinatra way of paying homage to his  hero, John F. Kennedy. It is a very interesting feeling to be able to watch  this movie with all its background history.<p>Picture and sound quality of  &quot;Suddenly&quot; is not good at all probably due to its old age. But it  is worthwhile to buy this inexpensive, interesting package. Enjoy it.
No knocks on the two movies-- they're both worth seeing.<br /><br />The issue here is the product itself.<br />This MADACY gray box series is of the lowest possible quality. Their SLP dubs track poorly and have degraded video of unrestored public domain stock.<br /><br />Truth is, at that snail's pace speed they could've fit three or four films on a single VHS instead of issuing this double dose space-waster.<br /><br />Best advice to anyone still purchasing videotape: try to locate studio releases or at very least labels that you are certain record at the SP mode.
