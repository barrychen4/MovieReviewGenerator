Can't believe someone put in a review that they couldn't burn it.  That is the way it works, read the directions before playing the nintendo game folks.  20 episodes for $14.99 is a steal.  Great for my kindle fire to keep my 2 year old singing whose clues blues clues... you gotta find the first paw print....  Great deal.  Great Show.  I would recommend these solely because they star Steve, not his evil demented cousin Joe.  My son is not a fan of Joe.  Season 1 is just Steve.  You will enjoy.  If you wonder if this is a good show for you kids, google tipping point blues clues for some great analysis by malcolm gladwell.
Blue is a sweet dog who is true to her name by color, and Steve is her number 1 master.<br /><br />Steve appears in most of the Blue's Clues seasons - even though he had to go to college near the end of season 4, and his brother, Joe had to take over.<br /><br />I'm just learning how to be a Blue's Clues fan again.
My grandson LOVES Blue's Clues and I paid and downloaded the first episode of this season, only to find that it couldn't be transferred to a DVD for him to watch - so as far as I'm concerned, Amazon Instant Video is a major rip-off.
