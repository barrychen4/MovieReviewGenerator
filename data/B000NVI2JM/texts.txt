When my father was receiving medical care, the doctor offered to write a prescription for a walker. He doesn't need a walker, I told the doctor, because he has one at home.<br /><br />"Don't worry," the doctor replied. "The walker is free."<br /><br />"Hold on there, bub," I said to Dr. E. Z. Munny. "It's not free. The taxpayers are paying for it."<br /><br />"Yeah, you're right," he replied with a wry grin, "but they can afford it."<br /><br />Our system is tottering with the current generation of old people leaning heavily on our over-burdened American budget but what will happen when the BIGGEST generation hits retirement (and becomes eligible for Medicare)?<br /><br />Walker calls the massive numbers of baby boomers coming into retirement an "actuarial nightmare." People keep living longer and health care costs keep rising and according to Walker, President Clinton made problems much, much worse when he expanded medicare to cover prescription drugs. In this interview, Walker says, "We've promised way more than we can afford to do. We can't afford the promises we've already made."<br /><br />He also states something I've observed for many years:  "We're offering unlimited health care to senior citizens and the system is unsustainable. We're going to have reform our health care system in installments and if we don't it could bankrupt America."<br /><br />It's a sobering video but very well done and one of the most interesting points is, no-one is contradicting David Walker. All the smart people agree with him. How I wish I could force all 535 members of Congress to sit and watch this film and then give a BOOK REPORT on how they're going to deal with it.
This was just what I needed to show to some of my clients.  Thanks<br />!
I don't think we can overstate the danger caused by our national debt.  Sadly, democracies tend to last only as long as it takes people to figure out that they can vote benefits for themselves and for someone else to pay for them.  In our case, previous generations (particularly the baby boomer generation) have voted for unprecedented benefits and have voted to leave the bill for their children and grand children.  This is the equivalent of one generation selling their children into slavery.<br /><br />You can see the first part of the video on youtube [...]
Any thinking American should see this report.  I am not a fan of 60 minutes since they have ruined many lives without accountability or remorse but this is a mandatory watch if you want to secure your future at all.
David Walker is a true patriot.  As the Comptroller General of the U.S. (the nations chief accountant), he was in a position to know the real story of the U.S. economy and the political promises of the last 50 years.  Since Congress chose not to listen to him, he took his story public.  If you missed it on TV you need to see it now.  Unfortunately, David Walker has resigned but the problem still exists.  You'll want to have a conversation with your Senators and Congressmen after viewing this interview.
Every taxpayer needs to be aware of the message Mr. Walker is presenting so that pressure is brought to bear on those that can effect the needed reforms to minimize the impact on our children and grandchildren.
