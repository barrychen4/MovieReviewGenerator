I agree with the other customers who think the original movie should never have been taken off the market. There are so MANY movies out that children should never see, but not this one. This movie shows how a little white boy CAN be friends with a black person. How a black man CAN be a positive influence on a white child. There's so much hate in this world that you would think that Disney would want to promote any kind of positive relationship between different types of people they could.
I saw this movie as a child and enjoyed it very much. My mother is 72 and still hopes to live to see the day when it's released again so her grandchildren can enjoy it. Strange how you can buy any movie about the "hood" and see people killing each other and calling names, or any movie about slavery and see how EVERYONE suffered, but put out a movie in which the slaves were treated kindly and loved and it's banned.<br /><br />Write Disney and tell them you want to see it, even if it's a limited release, like they do with some of their other classics.
I purchased the Sing-A-Long Songs, Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, here in England in the mistaken belief it was a VHS of the film. I feel hugely disappointed that because of over-exaggerated political correctness children are now deprived of a wonderful story.  I saw this film in London when I was 11 years old and it has stayed in my memory ever since.  I now have a grandson and would love to purchase a copy for him, if only Disney would relent and re-release this splendid children's film. The world has gone completely PC mad.  How can it be O.K. to make and show extremely violent and vicious films depicting racial tensions and perversions yet deprive our children of this delightful, gentle and entertaining film.  Wake up Disney - please don't let the extremists dictate your policies.
This gentle animation has and would delight children of all stripes and through its many characters and magical songs reminds us of kindly and cunning folks in history.  Should political correctness be used to ban books and history?  People are a lot smarter and a lot more sophisticated than the mickey mouse folks give them credit for:  we can handle it.  Walt would celebrate the end of the "bad old days," but SONG OF THE SOUTH is a treasure.
fOR ANYONE TO THINK THAT THIS MOVIE IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT OR INCORRECT IN ANY WAY IS INSANE!!..THE &lt;JUNK> THAT IS PUT OUT NOW IN THE NAME OF "FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT" CANNOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THIS FILM!..I AM ANGLO (THAT'S WHITE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO PREFER WORDS INSTEAD OF TRUTH!), I WAS RAISED IN THE SOUTH, AND I WAS RAISED BY A BLACK WOMAN THAT LOVED THIS FILM!..IT IS ALL IN THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THINGS AND AT YOURSELF..SO..WHERE CAN I GET A COPY..IF ANYONE KNOWS?
...or whatever (probably much lower) the burning point of celluloid and videotape might be.  Is Tom Ridge reading this?  Should I be afraid to state that I just received for Christmas a pirated version of Song of the South that has either Hiragana or Chinese subtitles for the songs?  I'm 57.  I saw the movie for the first time when I was just under 2 years old (and sang and danced through the last scene along w/ the kids on the screen - and nobody stopped me or told me to sit) and for the last time when I was about 13.  Its racial overtones turned me into a terrible person - it taught me that despite my whitebread upbringing I could be friends w/ black kids which I proceeded to do once in college, which, in turn, led me to move to Haiti for ten years where I studied anthropology at the university and learned that Uncle Remus is a "griot" or village storyteller whose function is to pass tradition orally to the new generations and that those same stories are known and loved in the West Indies and in Africa.  The ultimate upshot - an almost 35-year interracial relationship which remains stable and strong.  God, yes, that's a dangerous movie.  Whatever you do, Disney, DON'T RELEASE IT!!  (And Tom Ridge, don't throw me in the briar patch - whatever you do).
I bought this tape because the search engine brought it up when I asked for "Song Of The South".  It is just a tape of sing-a-long children songs which includes Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah from Song Of The South.  A good tape if that is what you really wanted.
...just exactly how will children learn from our mistakes in the past if people censor them as if they never happened?
Is Disney afraid of a lawsuit?  They sponser gays rights and open their doors to Disney Land speacially for gays when they say they are a family oriented business. Why not put a classic film back on the selves and let the public decide if they want to buy it or not. You can not please everyone and no matter how hard you try someone always gets offended. PUT IT ON VIDEO!!!!
I don't know what all the fuss is about!  I am not a politically correct person.  I am a grandmother trying to show my grandsons what wonderful songs came out of such great movies produced by Disney.  All I know is that Disney should re-release such awsome movies so that future generations can admire and enjoy what they're parents grew up with.  I have most, if not all, of the sing along songs made by Disney on VHS and I would like them on DVD.  My children are successful in their careers and by no means did these movies do them any harm.  It taught them to enjoy beautiful music.  I agree with Mr. Willert, there are alot of unappropriate movies out there that should be banned but it seems that the most innocent, patriotic, no violence, no sex and certainly spiritual movies are the ones that are criticize the most.  And us as consumers, a majority, don't have a leg to stand on because of all the politically correct people, a minority, who have the power to decide what we should hear, see and believe.  So please go ahead and re-release all the sing along songs on DVD and believe me you'll have a alot of devoted customers for life (including me).
Walt Disney did not decide to stop making it: the NAACP threw a fit because Uncle Remus was a willing slave, so it was banned from USA marketing.  The film is still being circulated, copied and sold new in Europe!  If not available on Amazon, try eBay.  Some of the sellers are passing on their copies of it in USA's VHS form.  The European PAL versions do not play on most of our VHS players, but a good video conversion service can make it into a version that will play on all USA players.  That's how I got our VHS copy of the movie.  The film quality is not very good, but the show is still enjoyable.  I agree it is a part of history, a story about how pure hearts can love one another, and shows that the slaves were kind and smart and loving.  Yet the film industry is still allowed to make movies showing blacks being beaten and tortured in the 40's and 50's, which I think is sickening and harmful.  Song of the South took place in the 19th century, when the slaves were free but emotionally attached to their plantation homes.  Makes NO sense that this lovely film was banned.  My Dad used to tell us Uncle Remus stories when I grew up in the 50's, and we loved them.  It never occurred to us to be prejudiced.
This tape is good and we all love the songs but the tape is only 15 minutes long...kind of a dud really....<br />thank you...
been searching for Disney Films for my grandaughters and was sooooo very sorry to hear that The Song of the South has been "blacklisted".  From my childhood I remember this wonderful story and the fabulous songs that I still hum today...We live in a world of multicultures and multihistories....The Story should be viewed as such and Disney should get over themselves about offending anyone. If anything this heartfelt movie depicts good, wisdom, humor and down right happiness.  How about fabulous story telling....who does that today.. Wouldn't you want your children to be exposed to that instead of all the blowing up, vulgur language crap being shoved at our youth today.<br />Here's hoping that the powers that be at Disney see the light and release this wonderful folktale movie for a new generation.
This is yet ANOTHER TERRIFIC purchase for my twin 3yr old princess lovers!!! They have SOOOO enjoyed this video (and yet NEVER saw the orginal movie - way before their time but us oldies love it tooo!)til its almost WORN OUT! Sure wish was available via DVD? GREAT ITEM!
DISNEY, WHATS WRONG WITH YOU !  Michael Eisner.<p>Walt made this wonderful film.  It won an academy award.  It starred some wonderful actors, both black and white.  Michael Eisner should be ashamed to withdraw this wonderful fantasy from public viewing.  Eisner is ruining Disney and its reputation.  The Uncle Remus story's are timeless and will outlive Eisner.  Unfortunately, Eisner and his comittment to Political Correctness keeps this enchanting film from the public.
"Song of the South" is such a beautiful movie for young people to see,and why is it not available any more.Is it because ignorant liberal Hollywood Disney management has lost touch with common sense when it concerns the American people.This movie is not offensive,it is a wonderful movie about love,friendship,great songs,and nature's beautiful forest animals.Disney management...your blind and you don't even know it.Maybe if this movie were more violent you would make it available.Keep up the good work.
I have acquired this movie from elsewhere and have found it to be even more heart warming and loving than when I was a child. It depicts the old south in a fairly realistic way. My mother had Aunts and Uncles such as those depicted in the film. Even though it shows them threadbare there is plenty of love and caring to be had by all.<br />They have made "Roots" and "Root the Next Generation", "Amistad", "Malcom X" and even "Shaft".  This is a great classic film that all should share and enjoy.
I, too, am a fan of Song of the South, both the Disney book and movie.  I loved reading them aloud when I was a child and later as an adult.  It has been many years since I took my daughter to see the movie and was very disappointed that I could not find it available in any format for my grandchildren.  I would hope that Disney will re-release botht he book and the movie.  The Uncle Remus stories were true gems.
I WONDER WHAT THE THE DESENDENTS OF UNCLE REMUS WOULD SAY TO THE ANTI SOUTHER ZIONEST MICHAEL EISNER IF THEY COULD CONFRONT HIM PUBLICLY? "WHY WONT YOU LET US WATCH DADDY OR WHY CANT WE SEE GRANDPA?" SLAVERY HAS BEEN OVER FOR ABOUT 140 YEARS. YET THOSE OF US WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT OR THOSE WHO WERE NOT SLAVES LIKE TO MAKE THOSE OF US TODAY ESPECIALY THE KIDS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GUILTY OF ALL THAT ENDED OVER 140 YEARS AGO. FACE IT EISNER! THAT ERA HAPPENED BUT TO BAN A BEAUTIFUL FUN MOVIE LIKE SONG OF THE SOUTH IS INSULTING TO ALL OF THE ACTORS WHITE,BLACK AND MOST OF ALL, "TO WALT DISNEY HIMSELF" TO WOULD HAVE TOSSED YOU OUT ON YOUR EAR YEARS AGO IF HE HAD STILL BEEN ALIVE WHEN YOU DESIDED TO PULL THIS BAN ON SONG OF THE SOUTH BACK WHEN YOU DID. WHEN CREEPS LIKE WILL SLIDE IN SOMETHING SUBLIME LIKE A SPLIT SECOND FRAME OF A CHARACTER GETING A RISE IN HIS LEVYS O SOME HIDDEN SEX WORD IN THE CLOUDS  OR SOME OTHER KIND OF PERV. SCENE THAT YOU EISNER GET AS GIDDY AS MICHAEL JACKSON IN A ROOM FULL OF FIVE YEAR OLDS THAT YOU EISNER SLID INTO A MOVIE FOR KIDS TO WATCH WHILE NOBODY NOTICED. SONG OF THE SOUTH IS ABOUT A BIG A INSULT TO BLACKS AS SNOW WHITE IS TO REAL LIFE DWARFS. IF YA THINK ABOUT IT, I WONDER IF THAT MOVIE IS NEXT ON EISNERS HIT LIST.  JUST A FEW THOUGHTS FROM A 39 YEAR OLD GEEZER WHO GREW UP GOING TO DISNEY LAND.
