I so desperately wanted this to be a great movie.  I have a tremendous appreciation for what are otherwise considered guilty pleasure horror flicks, i.e,. those that are considered absurd by mainstream, but which I otherwise hesitate to admit my appreciation.  Case in point - Killer Pad, Tequila Body Shots, Hallow's End, etc.<br /><br />In this case, polynesia may be the only thing that approaches my passion for horror flicks.  Hawaii is by far my absolute favorite place, and so wish the polynesian supper clubs (esp. Kahiki) are as popular now as they were in the 50s.  So with this predisposition, I approached this movie not expecting much but really hoping it would have something redeeming.  Nope.  The absurd plot does not save the c**p production quality, terrible acting, blah blah blah.  Avoid, sadly.
Excellent character development.  Enticing Story line.  I don't want to give any spoilers in the review but there is a Tiki involved.
When I popped Tiki into my dvd player, my expectations were not very high but I was hoping to be entertained. Truthfully, this is a low budget picture with average actors. If this fact is enough to scare you away, avoid this movie. If you are okay with this, then give it a shot.<br /><br />The plot of this movie centers around a Carrie-like theme. Nerdy girl is humiliated by snobs and gets revenge by use of a tiki doll manifestation of her anger. Most of the murder scenes are brutal, creative, and sometimes comical. I could not help but laugh at the absurdity of the murder methods and the gibbering of the tiki throughout the movie.<br /><br />Don't expect a lot of extras or a widescreen presentation. There is a making of featurette and trailer.<br /><br />This is not a knock your socks off surprise, but I was definitely more entertained than I expected to be. If decently executed stupidity is what you are looking for, then you will probably find this movie worth a viewing. I am being generous with the four star rating because I typically dig independent films with limited budget and talent because I am pretty tired of the schlock out of hollywood. I like giving my money to people who will more likely appreciate it.<br /><br />I had fun watching it, and I hope you do too. I am not comparing the movie to cinematic masterpieces. This to me is a four star independent horror picture, which is totally different from a four star big hollywood production. I rate with consideration of budget, personal expectations, and overall entertainment value.<br /><br />If you watch this and hate it, remember, this is my personal opinion of this movie and I apologize if my review causes you to watch it and feel as if you have wasted 80 minutes of your life. Remember, it is a great privilege to live in a country where we have the ability to watch what we want, when we want. That in and of itself is a beautiful thing. Just knowing that I have that opportunity is enough to make watching any movie time well wasted.<br /><br />Thanks for reading the review. Now go tell somebody that you love them.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5U5IU">Tiki</a>
