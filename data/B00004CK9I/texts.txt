Von Ryan's Express is a WW2 movie deserving of classic status. The action is not exactly battlefield stuff, but the movie weaves an interesting plot into a tension filled escape of POW's from the Nazi's.  Frank Sinatra's sleepy style compliments the role he plays as someone who has just escaped from a POW camp.  The supporting cast all perform admirably and it is very refreshing to have a film where the Germans actually speak German and the Italians speak Italian.  Made in 1965, the period when war movies were made in droves, Von Ryan's Express stood out amoung them as being that little bit different.  What a great time I had in the late 60's and early 70's watching these movies and when this movie came out I found it so exciting.  I have lost none of that enthusiasm for the movie today.  It is one I regularly pull out of my DVD collection and give an airing.  Okay, it doesn't have the polish of recent war movies but it has qualities that just can't be emulated even with the latest movie making technology.  Highly recommended.
Von Ryan's Express belongs to the dying days of WW2-as-Boys-Own-adventure movies, where, for all the cynical window-dressing, the good guys can always outwit overwhelming numbers of Nazis and death is still heroic. It's also much more entertaining than it has any right to be as Frank Sinatra's unpopular new senior officer leads several hundred prisoners of war to freedom by hijacking a Nazi train and conning his way through Italy to Switzerland while Trevor Howard's old school British officer snipes at his bad form all the way and Edward Mulhare's loveable padre impersonates a German officer to get them past the checkpoints. Yep, it's The Great Escape meets The Train, with Great Escaper John Leyton along for the ride just in case anyone misses the connection. As big, not quite as dumb as it could be entertainment it certainly does the trick, throwing in an enjoyable if sparse Jerry Goldsmith score and a particularly memorable finale.<br /><br />Sadly the new 2-DVD release really is hard to recommend for any but hardcore Jerry Goldsmith fans, the only notable extras being an isolated score track and a brief featurette on the composer. Aside from trailers and TV spots, the rest is made up with talking heads background featurettes with none of the films surviving participants contributing. Even worse is the fact that brief clips are used from a vintage behind the scenes short made during production, but the short itself is not included. It's fine for a first-time buy, but not really worth an upgrade if you already have the previous edition.
This movie has all the elements of a good action movie. The outcome is uncertain. The bad guys are really bad. The hero (Frank Sinatra) is idealistic and optimistic, and suffers from bad-decision angst more than once.<p>The movie starts in an Italian POW camp, commanded by a heartless Italian commander played by Adolfo Celi, who some may remember as Emilio Largo in the James Bond thriller "Thunderball". Colonel Joseph Ryan (Sinatra) is nicknamed "Von Ryan" as he initially appears to be collaborating with their captors. Ryan is very optimistic and continually sees opportunity in every situation. Major Eric Fincham, played by Trevor Howard, is a pessimist, and sees disaster at every turn. Further, these two men are in conflict because Major Fincham was the ranking POW until Frank Sinatra was captured.<p>As the Allies appear to be threatening the region, the Italians guarding the prison leave, and suddenly the POWs have a chance to escape. Their escape is short-lived as they are soon re-captured by Germans. The POWs are placed into boxcars for transport to Germany, with the exception of the wounded, who are executed by German soldiers prior to the train's departure.<p>As the train travels to Germany, Ryan decides that there may be an opportunity for escape. Ryan leads the creation of a plan to eliminate the guards and take over the train, with the goal of eventually leaving the train to head for the coast and potential reunion with Allied forces. After taking over the train, the POWs first attempt to escape is thwarted when they find themselves in the middle of an Allied bombing mission. The POWs then develop an even more creative plan to escape to Switzerland. In their bid to escape the POWs must fight off the Luftwaffe and a Nazi-led troop train following close behind. The end of this movie will keep action war-movie fans on the edge of their seat until the credits roll.<p>There are several events in this movie that give depth to Ryan's character. Several events occur within the prison camp, such as when Ryan leads the men in burning all their clothes in order to get better clothing. Another is when Ryan supercedes Fincham in dealing with the prison commander after departure of the guards. Ryan twice saves people and twice the outcome is tragic. The first time Fincham is extremely critical of Ryan. The second time Fincham is sympathetic, but Ryan is so angry with himself he refuses to listen.<p>Ryan is generally optimistic and idealistic, which has often been a criticism of Americans by Europeans. On the other hand, Fincham is pessimistic and would consider himself to be a realist. These two approaches and views are compared throughout the movie, and ultimately the movie avoids answering the question as to whether one approach is better than the other. As the end of the movie approaches, it is clear that Ryan's faith in his optimism and idealism has been shaken. Similarly, Fincham has come to admire Ryan's optimism and idealism, and knows that the opportunity presented to the POWs was only as a result of Ryan's optimism. Ultimately, the movie suggests that perhaps the middle ground is the best.<p>This movie is one of the better war movies from the 50s and 60s, and along with "The Great Escape", is one of the very best POW prison escape movies. Certainly portions of the movie are unrealistic. However, look past the fictionalized account of the escape, watch the adventure, and observe the conflict of ideologies. An enjoyable to watch and well-done movie.
This film gets my vote for the best WWII movie ever!  It's got Trevor Howard as the penultimate crazy British colonel, and our man Frank as the no nonsense American Flying ace.  The characters bring out interesting  facts about the Italian Cooperation with the Germans (very half-hearted)  during wwII and the sense of frustration and uncertainty during the closing  days of the war on the part of all the countries involved.  This film  represents the sense of honor and integrity that were common among  soldiers, at that time, and how human beings can have odd interpratations  of these noble character traits.
One of the first books that I read as a teenager (that wasn't off the juvenile shelves) was "Von Ryan's Express" by David Westheimer.  It was a best seller at the time and I soon discovered why.  The key to the book was the extensive middle where the Allied prisoners take over a transport train one car at a time.  It was a very suspenseful and engrossing story of one-on-one, hand to hand combat with everything at stake.  Each of something like 22 cars is depicted with a writer's skill.  When the movie came out, I went to see it with a friend.  As the first railroad car was taken, I leaned over to him and said, "This is where it really gets exciting".  Low and behold, after taking two or three cars, the prisoners jump all the guards at the next stop.  So much for my expectations.<br /><br />The thing is, this probably is a pretty good movie.  I note the high ratings others have given it so I don't want to be overly negative.  It's more of a walk down memory lane that prompted me to write this review.  This was the movie that taught me what many others have said: With few exceptions, the book is always significantly better than the movie.  If you like this movie, read the book.
Sinatra is a cool American, whose P-38 is shot down over Italy in August 1943... The Allies were landing in Southern Italy, when Ryan is brought to an Italian prisoner of war camp...<br /><br />Sensing that the end is underway, the Italians were trying to get out of the war, and the Nazis were trying to keep the Allies out and the Italians in...<br /><br />A Fascist bully (Adolfo Celi) has ruled the POW camp, but with the collapse of Italian rule, he is thrown out...<br /><br />The British prisoners - professional soldiers of the 9th Fusiliers, whose constant attempts to escape have led to half rations and the withholding of medicine - headed by a heated Major (Trevor Howard), are not in agreement with the unpopular pilot, Colonel Joseph Ryan... They think him insufficiently hostile to the Italians and have given an insulting 'von" to his name, insisting that he is in the wrong army...<br /><br />The British get along with Ryan, however, when the escape is engineered... They seize a German train, and, impersonating German troops even as they evade German pursuers, try to make a run for it to the Swiss border... The viewers can forget about realism from that moment on... 'Von Ryan's Express' is pure adventure and courts no moral dilemmas in its story...<br /><br />Director Mark Robson tries to combine the suspense of 'The Great Escape' with the exciting action of 'The Guns of Navarone,' and he's successful enough... The pace is quick... The Italian locations are attractive... The confrontations with German troops are well handled...<br /><br />Ryan is a pragmatic character not unlike the far more tragic Col. Nicholson in 'The Bridge on the River Kwai.' As a colonel master-minding commando raids, he brings the film to a great climax on an Alpine viaduct...<br /><br />With the exception of a strange and shocking scene where a sexy escapee is gunned down in the back, ' Von Ryan's Express' gives us the necessary thrills to be pleased...
First of all, I'm only 19 years old and part of the new-age technology generation; yet I can't get enough of this movie. Sinatra and his supporting cast are truly unbelievable in this suspense-filled drama about a bunch of POW's trying to run north to escape Italian and Nazi control.<br />If you haven't seen it on American Movie Classics, then chances are you haven't seen this movie in decades. Since I'm still relatively young, AMC has been the only source for my own personal viewing of Von Ryan's Express...But not anymore. Trust me people, you won't regret this purchase. ...
A lot of effort went into this 1965 military war film classic.  Now you do not have to wait for the movie on American Movie Classics to see it in wide-screen.  This DVD version was released in Summer 2001.  Frank Sinatra, playing the part of a downed American pilot, leads hundreds of POWs on a dash for the Swiss frontier in this action packed movie.  Most of the action takes place on a hijacked Italian train, formerly commanded by the German military, as it winds its way ever deeper into enemy territory.<br /><br />Trevor Howard and Edward Mulhare (Known best for his roles in American television shows such as The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, and Knight Rider)co-star.  Also, look for Wolfgang Preis reprising the role of a German officer for the un-teenth time in his long career (The Longest Day, Anzio, Raid on Rommel, A Bridge Too Far, Battle of the Commandos, The Train, Is Paris Burning?, Ike the War Years, etc.).<br /><br />The story, either incidentally or accidentally, mirrors several actual events that took place at abandoned Italian POW camps after the armistice.  The Italian guards quit their posts and Allied prisoners awoke to find no one minding the camp. The Germans eventually moved in to establish authority, but in the few interim days there was a power vacuum.  Though the real life stories never involved stealing trains, there are dozens of stories of weakened and malnourished British and Commonwealth former POWs fleeing the approaching Germans.<br /><br />The film has nonstop action, train chases, aerial attacks and scenic Italian locations.  According to an article by Wolfgang Preis, the interior train scenes were filmed in Hollywood.  Actor James Brolin, who was under contract to 20th Century Fox, makes yet another appearance in a FOX movie.  According to the unofficial Hogan's Heroes guide, the leather jacket (or jackets) worn by Frank Sinatra in the film were later worn by Bob Crane on HOGAN'S HEROES.<br /><br />Action footage from VON RYAN'S EXPRESS has found its way into other films.  Most notably are scenes from the Messerschmitt attacks on the train.  In 1980 a television movie, THE SECRET WAR OF JACKIE'S GIRLS, featured the VON RYAN Messerschmitt footage poorly edited into scenes of a helicopter evading German aircraft.  Twentieth Century Fox was famous for recycling spectacular movie scenes into other theatrical and television films.  Remember how often attack scenes from TORA, TORA, TORA were found their way into movies like PEARL, MIDWAY, THE FINAL COUNTDOWN, and the televison remake of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.  Battle scenes from Patton also found their way into FIREBALL FORWARD and IKE: THE WAR YEARS.<br /><br />Curiously both the antagonists and protaganists are armed with German MP-40 machine pistols.  An actual MP-40 could empty its 32-round magazine in about three seconds.  The shooters in this film have machine pistols with unlimited ammunition.  Oh well, that's Hollywood.<br /><br />For 35 years those of us who were not around, too young, or too indifferent to catch this movie when it was first released in theaters were left at a disadvantage.  Growing up in the greater New York area, VON RYANS EXPRESS was only available as a yearly installment on the WABC afternoon movie, broadcast in two parts on consecutive days, or on the ever rarer late night showing.  Cable stations aired VON RYAN'S EXPRESS more often, but still in standard format.  With the release of the DVD you now have the opportunity to watch the film in all of its widescreen glory.
Simply put the best movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  Frank Sinatura, I must say, was an unbelievably good actor.  Although often known only for his singing talent, he proves his amazing talent for acting in this movie.  I have seen plenty of action movies throughout the years, however this movie is without a doubt my favorite.  I recommend it to any person, whether young or old, with the hopes that you enjoy it as much as i did!
I am 21 years old and have watched this movie since I was 4 years old. Its one of the greatest WWII movies with a great cast and a great story. If you loved The Great Escape, then you will find this as good as that movie was. I never knew Sinatra as a singer till much later in my life, but I knew him as an actor at first. Turned out he was great as an actor and singer.
Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard butt heads with each other while taking on the Nazis in this satisfying World War II film.  The first part of &quot;Von Ryan's Express&quot; takes place in an Italian Prisoner of War camp in 1943, when the Allies had invaded Southern Italy and Germany was trying to keep Italy in the war.  When Colonel Ryan (Sinatra) arrives at the camp he is the senior officer, although he is just a pilot and Major Fincham (Howard) is a career officer.  Ryan wants to just wait for the Allies to liberate the camp, while Fincham wants to escape.  When Ryan trades the prisoner's escape route for medical supplies, the English prisoners add the &quot;von&quot; to his name.  When the Italians abandon the camp, the prisoners escape into the country side only to be captured by the Nazis.  They then capture a German train and make a daring and exciting run for the Swiss border and freedom, believing that if only one of them escapes, it is a victory.<p>Not as compelling as &quot;The Great Escape,&quot; this is still a very entertaining film.  The scene where Ryan forces the Italian commandant (Adolfo Celi) to provide new clothing because the prisoners have all stripped and thrown their rags into a fire is certainly memorable, as is the moment when Ryan guns down the young woman (Raffaella Carra) who has sold them out to the Germans.  Sergio Fantoni as the sympathetic Italian Captain Oriani and Edward Mulhare as the German-speaking Chaplain Costanzo have solid supporting roles.  Half the movie is taken up by the train chase, which goes through cities being bomb and along treacherous mountain tracks, but the heated exchanges between Ryan and Fincham are at the heart of this film.  Sinatra is remarkably comfortable with this role, which is ultimately what makes &quot;Von Ryan's Express&quot; work as much as the train chase.
One of the best World War II action-adventure movies, Von Ryan's Express, is an exciting and suspense filled ride.  The movie follows the exploits of a group of Allied prisoners, liberated from an Italian POW camp, in their bid for freedom on a hijacked troop train.<p>Frank Sinatra is Colonel Joseph Ryan, a pilot shot down over Italy in 1943, shortly before the fall of the country to the Allies.  Captured, he is placed in an Italian POW camp, where the Allied commanding officer has just died as a result of punishment inflicted by the camp's Commander (Aldolfo Celi).  As the highest ranking Allied officer, Ryan assumes command, much to the consternation of the ranking British officer (Trevor Howard).  Because Italy's collapse appears imminent, Ryan seeks to immediately improve the conditions for the men in camp, at the expense of preparations for escape.  For this perceived collaboration, he is christened "Von Ryan" by his own side.<p>When Italy falls, the prisoners find themselves unguarded as their Italian captors have disappeared.  The group ventures out into the countryside, but is soon recaptured, this time by Nazi forces, who ruthlessly execute the wounded prisoners.  The remaining men are put aboard a troop train for transport to a German run POW camp.  Led by Ryan, the Allied forces commandeer the train in a violent take over.  As the train proceeds north towards the Fatherland, the only Nazi left alive is Major Von Klemment (Wolfgang Preiss).  His lovely mistress, Gabriella (Rafella Cara) is also aboard.  The German language skills of the camp's chaplain (Edward Mulhare), are put to good use as he impersonates a Nazi officer allowing the train to continue on its escape route.  <p>During a train stop, Von Klemment and Gabriella escape from the train, and Ryan winds up killing them both.  Was it really necessary that the "innocent" Gabriella die, shot in the back?  The need to prevent her from telling the authorities about the escape was paramount, but running in a tight skirt, she could have been easily caught by Ryan had he just given chase, instead of exercising his itchy trigger finger.  Her death stains him further, and seems to serve as justification for his own fate.<p>After this pivotal incident, the remainder of the movie is a race through the mountains to the Swiss border.  With the Allies beating back the pursuing Germans all along the way.  In the end you find yourself pulling hard for "Von Ryan", but it is just not to be.<p>While the movie is very entertaining, it has been criticized for being totally unrealistic.  Real POW's have stated that they were much too weak and malnourished to engage in any activity even approaching what is shown in the movie.  Even viewed as pure fiction, this film is still very enjoyable.
Von Ryan's Express is a compelling drama featuring the heroism and bravery of a motley crew of prisoners.  Not short on bravery Frank Sinatra and his men do their best to wreek havoc on the German war effort and get their freedom as well.  The action never stops and hopes remain high until the end when the main hero loses his life.  It is a reminder that many gave their lives in a noble effort to win the peace and preserve a way of life.  War is not a noble profession, but sometimes men can rise above with a little resolve and dignity.  The greatest generation of all time is represented well here.  One can only hope that lessons were learned in this war.  Some choose to forget them, but I never will.  I cherish my freedom and never forget those who died so I could live in peace.
Von Ryan's Express is a fictitious gripping tale of brave men in a P.O.W. camp at the end of the war.  It takes place in Italy, and with Trevour Howard (the epitomy of the upper class English soldier)as co star, this one is a winner.  The twists and somewhat impossible actions that take place in this movie, love him or hate him, I believe this movie one of Sinatra's best, up there with "From Here to Eternity". Whilst the plot is to get all the P.O.W's out of Italy by taking over a train and getting it through the centre of Rome, some of the stunts used even this long ago, are spectacular.  If you like this type of underdog movie, where the good guys have to overcome all the obsticles to beat the bad guys then this is the movie for you. Even though it all happened over 60 years ago I believe we can still gain great enjoyment out of a tale like this. It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.  Does it have a happy ending, mmm the twist is there right to the end so you will have to watch it to find out.
Von Ryan's Express is an excellent war adventure set in Italy during WWII.  The movie is about a group of prisoners attempting to escape to freedom by taking over the train they are being transported on.  They are led by a man they hate, US Air Force Colonel Joseph Ryan, because of the way things happened in the past prison camp.  This is a very exciting movie with plenty of action and also a unique story out of World War II.  As well, the conclusion is one of the best endings to a war movie ever.  Trevor Howard's line is the perfect capper.<p> This movie boasts an excellent cast to go along with fine storytelling and action.  Frank Sinatra is very good as Colonel Ryan with Trevor Howard also great as his second in command British Major Fincham.  Also joining them are Brad Dexter, Sergio Fantoni, John Leyton, Edward Mulhare as Father Costanza in a very funny role, and Wolfgang Preiss in another role as an arrogant German officer.  This is a very good movie with an impressive cast alongside a good story.  Excellent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith also.  The DVD gives a widescreen presentation, remastered stereo, and also theatrical trailers from several movies including this one.  A worthwhile movie for Sinatra fans and action fans!
Von Ryan's Express is a classical world war two movie.It stars Frank Sinatra.This happens to be one of my favorites.Which focuses on the support given by the Italians to the Germans.Its one of the few that does this.You will not be disappointed with this classic.I would choose this one if you like Frank or just wish to see some really cool trains..
I believe that this movie is one of the best screen performances Frank Sinatra has ever given, the screen play is also excellent, this movie has been under rated in my opinion as many of Sinatra's movies are. It's a good action flick with very good performances, Trevor Howard is also a very good actor.
Von Ryan's Express is one of Sinatra's best starring roles. Sinatra, notorious for only doing one or two takes per scene, turns in a fine performance. He hated doing more than a couple of takes because he felt it caused the "freshness" of the scene becoming "stale". In Von Ryan's Express he got all of his scenes right.<br /><br />Col. Ryan (Sinatra) is an American Army Air Corps pilot that is shot down over Italy near the end of the Italian Campaign. One of the earliest scenes sets the tone of the movie: The Germans go to the crash site to capture the pilot but the Italians have already gotten him; in an act of defiance they tell the Germans he never got out of the burning wreckage. When the Germans leave the Italian soldiers blow a raspberry. When they part there's Col. Ryan drinking from a wine bottle. He's taken to a POW camp that's run by the Italians. Maj. Fincham (Trevor Howard) is in charge of the POW's due to the C.O. having just passed away the previous night. The camp is mostly British with only a handful of Americans present. Ryan issues new orders that all escape attempts are to cease immediately (thus the new name, Von Ryan). His reasoning is that they won't be prisoners longer than 90 days. Ryan is appalled at the malaria that's rampant & the filthy rags the prisoners are wearing.<br /><br />Battaglia (Adolfo Celi) is the Italian camp commander & is a petty tyrant who's been using the Red Cross supplies for the prisoners as a supplement to his income by dealing them on the black market. His aide, Capt. Oriani (Sergio Fantoni) is much more sympathetic & caring. He, in fact, becomes part of the later escape attempt.<br /><br />Edward Mulhare portrays Constanzo, a priest. He plays a pivotal role later in the film because he is fluent in German thus enabling the escape attempt to a further degree.<br /><br />Wolfgang Preiss portrays Maj. von Kleinment, the commander of the prisoner train.<br /><br />There's also Brad Dexter as Sgt. Bostick. Dexter being the least successful, at least as an actor, of the cast from The Magnificent 7. James Brolin has a small role as Pvt. Ames.<br /><br />Von Ryan's express is an extremely well paced film directed by Mark Robson. There's hardly a slow minute nor anything that terribly stretches the credibility of the events that are shown. Col. Ryan is an extremely likable character that has everyone's best interests in mind. This is one of those films that I hope the ending will be different each time that I watch it; I know that to be an impossibility but just once I'd like to see Col. Ryan make the escape.<br /><br />This version of Von Ryan's Express has a bonus disc full of bonus features. The film is in excellent condition & is in the widescreen format.
An excellent World War II movie. This one would go into a category that I would consider "classic." I would consider this to be a "must have" for folks that like movies involving WW2.<br />Frank Sinatra does an excellent job as Colonel Ryan a captured American pilot that finds himself in a prison camp in Italy. Colonel Ryan is put in command of the prisoners due to his rank. Two problems. The first problem is that Ryan is one of only a handful of American P.O.W.s in a predominently British camp. The other is the Italian Commanding office of the camp. It goes from there.. GREAT movie
this movie is good especially the language,they spoke in their own language and with enlish subtitles so that we can understand what they are talking about,in german.i hope all war movie comes in oringinal dialect of cause it must have english subtitle.
I saw this movie years ago and loved it then. When I saw the DVD I brought it. The quality of this fast paced movie is very good. I really enjoyed the scenes where Frank Sinitra,as the new POW leader,made the Italians give the POWs new uniforms. The action is plentiful and the acting good.Sinitra doesn't sing but he is convincing as the American colonel.
I this movie is my favorite movie of all time.  I am biased towards it because I have this movie on VHS, laserdisc (an old media type), DVD, and now the Special Edition DVD.  If you like the movie you will love the 2nd disk that is with this.  It is a great movie and it is about time that 20th Century Fox come out with the Special edition.  I am not going to go into details about the movie, you can read those above, but Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard are dynamite in this film!
As the allies begin to push the nazi back toward Germany , U.S Combat pilot Col. Joseph Ryan ( Frank Sinatra 1915-1998 ) is shot down and placed in a prison camp . Initialy , he's more concerned with surviving than escaping , carning him the isulting nick name *Von Ryan* , But in time , Ryan takes over from the commanding British officer ( Trevor Howard 1918-1988) and masterminds a daredevil race for freedom that involves commandeering a train and getting it across Italy to Switzerland with the nazi in hot pursuit . Then it's a blazing action , hairraising chase and spetacular Italian scenary in this oscar nominated adventure that runs full speed until the nail-bitting finale . High Quality Transfer .
If you liked the Civil War story of the stolen train in which Anderson stole the train the General Laregest mass awards of the Congressional Medal of Honor in the histroy of the USA)  and ran it through Confederate territory being pursued by the dedicated Mr Fuller, then you will think this is wonderful...A British regiment is in an Italian concentration camp when an American Piolot (Frank Sinatra) arrives...he is the senior officer but the tradition of a fusilier regiment vs an American flying jock who thinks the war is just about over provides a good basis for character development amongst the allies...when the italians surrender the prisioners are to be moved north to Germany...however if all had gone according to plan there would have been no need for a movie...a must see...must own
One often forgets that Frank Sinatra, besides being one of the last century's (Yeah, it is!) vocal talents, was one heckuva an actor.  &quot;Von Ryan's Express&quot; is a great World War II yarn with a  &quot;Great Escape&quot;-type storyline and vivid performances from the  main stars and the supporting players.  Of course, the Nazi villains are  rather stereotypically rotten, but that just adds to the &quot;fun&quot; as  Sinatra and company outwit them.  The end scene still brings a tear to this  reviewer's eyes.
Von Ryan's Express (VRE) is classic WWII `escapist' entertainment.  Frank Sinatra stars in the suspenseful adventure that involves a train commandeered by a group of liberated Allied POW's in Italy, making a desperate bid for freedom, with the German army close behind.  Although this two disc version of VRE provides additional information about the film, and has some informative bonus features, you may want to pass, if you already own the regular edition of the film.  Much of the focus is directed at legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith, and while Goldsmith did marvelous work in both film and television, it seems a bit odd having the music department sharing the spotlight with the megastar Sinatra.<br /><br />The bonus disc contains four short featurettes, trailers, TV spots and a still gallery.  Very nice, but this content totals less than an hour.  Also included are four, high quality, miniature replicas of lobby cards.<br /><br />As the sole bonus feature on the main disc, Goldsmith's musical score is isolated, and combined with a new commentary track.  Rousing and exciting when it needs to be, and poignant as well, Goldsmith's music is an excellent match for the onscreen action.  The composer seems to have taken a minimalist approach, as only about 27 minutes of the film has music running underneath.  VRE runs 117 minutes, and during most of the remaining 90 minutes, commentary is provided by producer Nick Redman, musical historian John Burlingame, and screenwriter Lem Dobbs, who discuss both the music, and other matters concerning the film.  Their commentary is rather low-key and analytical, mostly centered on Sinatra, and putting VRE in historical context.  Running between the sections with music, the commentary is interesting, though disjointed at times.  Unfortunately, aside from Sinatra, not much is said about others in the cast, like Trevor Howard or Edward Mulhare.  Raffaella Carra receives some critical hits from the panel.  No mention at all is made of actors Adolfo Celi, Sergio Fantoni, Wolfgang Preiss, or Vito Scotti.<br /><br />The film was shot in Hollywood, and at various locations in Europe.  Prior to VRE, Sinatra had been in Hawaii, directing his first (and only) film, None But the Brave (1965), a WWII adventure set on an island in the south Pacific.  While in Hawaii, Sinatra was apparently saved from drowning by Brad Dexter, who became a close friend.  Thanks to Frank, Dexter appears in VRE with fourth billing.<br /><br />According to information in the bonus materials, Twentieth Century Fox's epic, Cleopatra (1963) was a financial bomb, and the crippled studio was backing VRE, looking for it to deliver solid returns at the box office.  Similar to `The Great Escape', the screenplay was modified to increase the level of action, and boost the film's appeal.  VRE was based on a book by David Westheimer, who actually was a POW in Italy.  Westheimer worked on the original screenplay, and other writers later contributed to create a more action-packed and exciting, though unrealistic story.  When Old Blues Eyes signed on, the Von Ryan character was rewritten to reflect his personality.  During production, Sinatra was demanding and temperamental, and had issues with director Mark Robson.  It was Sinatra who insisted that his character die, and he refused to film an alternate ending.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith, who wanted to be a composer from an early age, won an Oscar for The Omen (1976).  A true giant in the industry, he scored many other films in his long career, including The Planet of the Apes, The Blue Max, Patton, Chinatown, Our Man Flint, Papillion, Logan's Run, The Sand Pebbles, Basic Instinct, Total Recall, Deep Rising, Supergirl, Alien, Poltergeist, Air Force One, Mulan, and Star Trek the Motion Picture.  Though his score for Von Ryan was excellent, because of lack of material, a soundtrack was never released.  Goldsmith passed away in 2004 at the age of 75.<br /><br />Von Ryan's Express is a classic film that is very much indicative of a particular time, style, and genre of filmmaking.  Featuring a charismatic star, it sweeps you along and takes you on a tense and exciting journey.  This edition is certainly the one to get, but for those that already own the standard version of the film, unless you really love Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra, or perhaps Jerry Goldsmith, it may not justify a repeat purchase.
Ok here goes! (I'll review the movie and this new issue of it later).<br /><br />This release is part of 20th Century Fox's ongoing "CINEMA CLASSICS COLLECTION". Initially Fox's re-issues were called "STUDIO CLASSICS" (as they still are here in the UK), but they've been superseded with these. The CCC series is American, Region 1-only and will require multi-region players to play the titles on.<br /><br />In the UK, Fox's premier series is called CINEMA RESERVE (see my review of "The Day The Earth Stood Still" for the full UK list). Again - I mention all of this because, if you type in "Cinema Reserve" or "Cinema Classics Collection" into the Amazon database on either side of the pond - you don't get any real info on either series! (Fox's site has info - but not the Amazon database). Having just received 2 CCC titles in the post (Von Ryan's Express and Fantastic Voyage) and having enjoyed them so much and loved their shiny new transfers, I feel sure other movie buffs will want to know what's available/forthcoming.<br /><br />The CINEMA CLASSICS COLLECTION series houses most of their titles in card wrap covers clearly marked as such at the top of the box. The artwork usually reflects the original poster art of the movie (the Studio Classics series tended to reflect the old video covers of the 70's & 80's). The DVD inside has the same artwork in its jewel case. The card wrap is a nice touch and lends the issue a classy feel. Some of the titles are 2DVD sets, all are restored transfers in one way or another - many exemplary (some have been criticized in minor ways) and some of the sets (like this one) come with lovely Lobby Card Postcards reproducing the original promotional shots of the film. Some even have a poster.  The Card Wraps are NOT numbered or sequenced in any way (both the Studio Classics series and the Cinema Reserve series ARE numbered on their spines). Each CCC issue has a dedicated inlay - usually 2 or 3 pages - and each is full of great info about the shoot - the stars - the release - it's legacy etc. The discs themselves are loaded with fascinating extras, re-mastered soundtracks, archive material etc.... Fox has to be praised for this. The series is clearly building momentum in the States and is gaining the respect among collectors and lovers of film that say the WARNER BROTHERS SIGNATURE COLLECTION boxes have.<br /><br />As a lover of oldies and classics, I thought I'd compile a list of these for fans here in the UK; many of these tiles are obscure and are REGION 1 only. I've cobbled this list together from several sources and the obvious sites for Fox, but if there are inaccuracies/additions/substractions, then please feel free to point them out. Titles in the Series are listed as follows - Film Title (Principal Actors), Original Year of Release, DVD Year Of Release, No. of Discs and (Any Other Relevent Info). Also wih regard to the Artwork on Amazon USA and UK: some of these new re-issues display the artwork of older issues which of course is confusing; however, in some cases, customers have provided pictures of the new CCC packaging themselves - I've noted this in the list below wherever possible.<br /><br />20th Century Fox - CINEMA CLASSICS COLLECTION - The Series So Far In Alphabetical Order (USA REGION 1)<br />(Titles That Are Only Available As Part Of A Box Set Are Also Included)<br /><br />A-Haunting We Will Go (Laurel and Hardy), 1942 (available only as part of the Laurel & Hardy Collection Volume 2 box set)<br />(Hemingway's) Adventures Of A Young Man (Paul Newman), 1962 (available only as part the Hemingway Classics Collection box set)<br />The Agony & The Ecstasy (Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison), 1965, April 2005, 1 Disc (Old Artwork Shown on Amazon)<br />Ambassador Bill (Will Rogers), 1931 (available only as part of the Will Rogers Collection Volume 2 box set)<br />Anna Karenina (Vivien Leigh and Ralph Richardson), 1948, April 2007, 1 Disc<br />Bedazzled (Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Raquel Welch), 1967, April 2007, 1 Disc  (Old Artwork Shown on Amazon)<br />Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls (Russ Meyers), 1970, June 2006, 1 Disc (see also Valley Of The Dolls) (also available on the CINEMA RESERVE series in the UK)<br />The Bible...In The Beginning (Richard Harris and George C Scott), 1966, 1 Disc (Old Artwork Shown on Amazon)<br />The Big Noise (Laurel and Hardy), 1944 (only available as part of the Laurel & Hardy Collection Volume 1 box set)<br />The Black Camel (Warner Oland and Bela Lugosi), 1931, August 2007 (only available as part of the Charlie Chan Volume 3 box set)<br />The Black Rose (Tyrone Power, Orson Welles and Jack Hawkins), 1950, May 2007, 1 Disc (also available as part of the Tyrone Power Collection box set)<br />Blood And Sand (Tyrone Power and Rita Hayworth), 1941, May 2007, 1 Disc (also available as part of the Tyrone Power Collection box set)<br />Blue, White & Perfect (Lloyd Nolan), 1941 (only available as part of the Michael Shayne Mysteries Volume 1 box set)<br />The Bullfighters (Laurel and Hardy), 1945 (only available as part of the Laurel & Hardy Collection Volume 2 box set)<br />Call Of The Wild (Clark Gable and Loretta Young), 1935 (only available as part of the Clark Gable Collection box set)<br />Caprice (Doris Day and Richard Harris),1967, June 2007, 1 Disc<br />The Captain From Castile (Tyrone Power, Jean Peters and Cesar Romero), 1948, May 2007, 1 Disc (also available as part of the Tyrone Power Collection box set)<br />The Chairman (Gregory Peck and Anne Heywood), 1969, November 2006, 1 Disc<br />Charley's Aunt (Jack Benny and Kay Frances), 1941, June 2007, 1 Disc<br />Charlie Chan Collection Volume 1 (Warner Oland as Chan), (Box Set containing 5 films, Charlie Chan In London, Charlie Chan In Paris, Charlie Chan In Egypt, Charlie Chan In Shanghai and Eran Trece) (Titles Not Available Individually), June 2006<br />Charlie Chan Collection Volume 2  (Warner Oland as Chan) (Box Set containing 4 films, Charlie Chan At The Circus, Charlie Chan At The Olympics, Charlie Chan At The Opera, Charlie Chan At The Race Track) (Titles Not Available Individually), Dec 2006<br />Charlie Chan Collection Volume 3  (Warner Oland as Chan) (Box Set containing 4 films, Charlie Chan's Secret, Charlie Chan At Monte Carlo, Charlie Chan On Broadway, The Black Camel) (Titles Not Available Individually), August 2007<br />Cinderella Liberty (James Caan, Masha Mason and Eli Wallach) 1973, March 2007, 1 Disc<br />Clark Gable Collection Volume 1 (Box Set containing 3 films, Call Of The Wild, Soldier Of Fortune, The Tall Men) (Titles Not Available Individually), August 2006<br />The Dancing Masters (Laurel and Hardy), 1943 (only available as part of the Laurel & Hardy Collection Volume 2 box set)<br />David Harum (Will Rogers). 1934 (only available as part of the Will Rogers Collection Volume 1 box set)<br />Deadfall (Michael Caine and Nanette Newman), 1968, October 2006, 1 Disc<br />Demetrius & The Gladiators (Victor Mature, Susan Hayward and Michael Rennie), 1954, due October 2007, 1 Disc<br />Do Not Disturb (Doris Day and Rod Taylor), 1965, January 2007, 1 Disc<br />Doubting Thomas (Will Rogers), 1935 (only available as part of the Will Rogers Collection Volume 1 box set)<br />Eran Trece (Warner Oland as Charlie Chan), 1931 (only available as part of the Charlie Chan Volume 1 box set)<br />Fantastic Voyage (Edmond O'Brien, Donald Pleasence and Raquel Welch), 1966, June 2007, 1 Disc<br />Flint (James Coburn) -

That took me a few hours!<br /><br />Now back to this issue.<br />Disc 1 has the movie and the transfer and restoration is gorgeous - great colour - very little if any scratches - score in 5.1 - Isolated score Track with Commentary by three knowledge types.<br /><br />Disc 2: (a) Reliving The Adventure Of Von Ryan's Express, 2007 featurette with great on-set footage of Sinatra and Howard and filming in the mountains, rewrites of the script etc (about 30 minutes)<br />(b) Hollywood & The War, 2007 Featurette on War Movies in General (including Von Ryan) - a little superfluous to requirements, but interesting nonetheless (about 20-25 minutes)<br />(c) The Music Of Von Ryan's Express, 2007, probably the most pointless piece on it - it consists of Jerry Goldsmiths excellent score being highlighted as parts of the film are played - that's it - just bits of the film being played with his music in it - any fool could have made this and it smacks of filler. Far better is...<br />(d) Bringing Movies To Life: The Legacy Of Jerry Goldsmith, 2007 featurette on the legendary composer with superb family footage and interviews, clips from Planet Of The Apes and how he revolutionised how movie music was used - his drums and piano runs on Von Ryan literally carrying the action along.<br />(e) Original trailers and (f) TV Spots (g) Stills Gallery. Unfortunately, Disc 2 feels like it could easily have been fitted onto Disc 1.  Still, there is stuff here for lovers of Sinatra, Howard, Goldsmith and the movie itself.<br /><br />The booklet is very informative and the envelope of Lobby Cards an absolute treat (why don't they have these in ANY of the UK CINEMA RESERVE releases??)<br /><br />A Sunday Afternoon classic then - it's not The Great Escape or The Battle Of Britain for sure, but it is entertaining. I'll definitely be collecting more titles in this series. And the print was just superb - that's what I want most - good films presented to me - Joe Public - in a good way.
Gorgeously shot on location in Italy, Mark Robson's underrated 1965 war drama is clever, credible, and exceedingly suspenseful. The ensemble cast, including Sinatra as rugged Colonel Ryan and Trevor Howard as a rigid British officer, really clicks. Director Robson keeps the action brisk on this "Express," resulting in a breathless ride with a stunner of an ending.
Although not as thrilling as John Frankenheimer's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079284047X">The Train</a>, starring Burt Lancaster, who did his own stunts, "Von Ryan's Express" is still a mild diversion.<br /><br />The main problem with this film, as I see it, is that, unlike "The Train," there is no one particularly nasty adversary who embodies all the evil and stubbornness that stands in the way of the goal, in this case, an  escape by POWs. Instead, the escapees are merely trying to evade the German army rather than a monomaniacal officer.<br /><br />Wolfgang Preiss, who also appeared in "The Train," does his usual turn as a Nazi officer, but he is not a major figure. 'Von' Ryan (Frank Sinatra) is only mildly opposed by the British officer (Trevor Howard),  who questions his methods. As a result, the tension between the two personalities is rather tame.<br /><br />I suspect that Sinatra didn't want to share center stage with Howard, who is quite capable of portraying a nasty piece of work if given the opportunity.<br /><br />Disc One contains the movie and "An isolated track score with commentary," a confused affair that didn't live up to expectations. Disc Two has four modest featurettes and a few odds and ends.<br /><br />If you're looking for World War II excitement and don't already own "The Train," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGTQ7U">The Guns of Navarone (Collector's Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNME">Where Eagles Dare</a>, I'd skip "Von Ryan" and go for one of those.
There are two great 'behind enemy lines pow escape' movies and the great escape is one and so is this.  I don't like Sinatra's music but his ww2 movies were really good.
VON RYAN'S EXPRESS is a great WWII action film about allied soldiers who hijack a train to get POW's to saftey.  Frank Sinatra, in the title role, and an all-star cast are great as they try to outsmart the Germans as they drive the train through enemy territory. There are great action scenes and pulse pounding moments. However, the ending, depending on one's point of view is either classic or depressing.  Frank Sinatra was at the top of his game and popularity that he lets his character get killed in the final moments of the film practically imitated by James Brown in the DIRTY DOZEN.  Overall, a great movie!! Note: Look for James Brolin (aka Barbara Streisand's hubby) in a supporting role.
Mark robson has crafted a film of high suspense and cinematic excellence.  Sinatra's performance is on a par with his portrayal of the Korean War brain-washed captain in, "The Manchurian Candidate."  This DVD would be a welcome addition to any collector's action/suspense section of their library.
A great collection of World War II Movies. Great actors and great action. I highly recommend this set. And you can't beat the price.
I hadn't seen this movie since it came out in theaters, so it was just like seeing it for the first time. Well-acted, with an outstanding cast, "Von Ryan's Express" has many thrills, unexpected events, and humour. If you have not seen a Sinatra film, this would be a good place to begin. Get out the popcorn and soda!
Frank does a wonderful job in the film, as do all the supporting actors.It is a classic, and a good one!!! AA++ I am very pleased with the purchase!!
I've watched this film probably six or seven times, and it never really gets old. Is it the same as the book? No, but what movie is--and the book didn't feature the Chairman of the Board! :)<br />It is similar to a number of WWII escape films that were made around this time, but Sinatra's acting ability really makes this one stand out. Very much worth your time and money.<br />(Disclaimer: This review is of the movie itself, not the product as purchased from Amazon).
One of my fav films . I bought this on VHS years ago for my now late father. He loved it and I enjoyed it so much I also bought a copy .<br />Being from NJ many people knew Mr .Sinatra ( my ex father in law grew up with him ) his works are without compare .<br />I bought this again as it reminds me of the times dad and I would set and watch old sci fi films , Abbott and Costello and of course Mr Sinatra .<br />Tevor Howard is a fine English actor and has much to his credit , I do feel Edward Mulhare stole the show as he impersonated an arrogant  German officer .<br />If you like something thats actually light , yes a war movie , and enjoy rooting for the good guys this film is it!<br />we baby boomers must have good taste as my nephew has asked to borrow Von Ryans .....
But doesn't the trailer kind of ruin it for those of us that haven't seen all the classics? I'm not to sure I want to buy it anymore :(
Four really outstanding World War 2 movies. This set is worth every penny and more, buying them all individually would cost 4x as much. The DVDS are all top grade and the movies are totally remastered. Where else can you get 4 great movies together with so many great actors in them at such a low price.
I saw the movie a number of years ago and liked it. Wanted a copy for my "library". This is good WWII action film.
If you like World War II movies you will enjoy "Von Ryan's Express".  It is suspenseful until the very end.  It has an all star cast from the 1950-60's, but not in their usual "handsome devil" roles. It is a great movie because it shows the sacrifices real men and women made in order for us to live as we do today. This was before "Don't ask. Don't tell."  They didn't need that back then.
A fine movie.  I saw this one years ago, when it first came out.  (Yes, I've dated myself.)  This a quality recording, and if this is your genre, you will enjoy the movie.
Synopsis<br /> Colonel Ryan (Frank Sinatra) leads a daring escape attempt across Italy.  His men hate him, he faces constant opposition from a British Major (Trevor Howard), and from the German soldiers that are only a few steps behind him.  This thrilling chase film is an exciting cross of The Great Escape and The Train.<br /><br />Sexual Content<br /> Early on in the film, Ryan orders his soldiers to undress and burn their uniforms so that they will receive the new ones promised them by an Italian officer (we see a far out view from behind, and a few close-ups from the front above the waist).  Later, when Ryan captures the train, it is discovered that a German officer's mistress is on board.  We see her in a slightly low-cut nightgown.  Later, she tries to seduce Ryan (mild, and children probably won't notice this).  He resists and leaves her angered.<br />Violence<br /> Many shootings and explosions.  Some blood is visible in the aftermath, but none during the actual scenes.  Several German soldiers are strangled (mild) and a few POW's are seen caught on fire (also mild).  Several main characters are killed and (SPOILER WARNING) a woman is shot in the back to prevent her from escaping.<br />Language<br /> Scattered D-words, H-words, and a few B-words.  Surprising for the time, but mild by today's standards.<br />Morales<br /> Characters drink, smoke, and curse.  Killing innocent people is suggested in order to save the POW's escape attempt.  A main character shoots a woman in the back.  One of the main characters is a Catholic priest.  He is shown in a positive light, and not to be a fake, however the other characters often make jokes as his expense.<br />Conclusion<br /> Moderately exciting war film that falls short of The Great Escape, but is still far superior to most films of the genre.  Frank Sinatra gives a decent performance, but it is hard to picture the middle-aged actor as a "hot-shot flyboy".  The real excitement comes from the film's final action scene with planes chasing the train through mountain passes, in a scene that loses little in terms of modern special effects.  The ending is slightly surprising and fairly downbeat, but overall this is a good film for fans of old war movies.  Depends on your family whether the kids get to see it or not.
I'm not a big fan of fictional war movies.  I mean, come on, there were so many heroic events that took place that there should never really be a need to make a plot up.  But, Von Ryan's Express is fiction, and it's actually pretty well done.<br /><br />The plot is a little weak at times.  For the life of me I couldn't understand why, when only 6 miles from the coast the men all stopped and rested.  If I'd been a prisoner of war for years and was only a 2 hour march from my own troops and freedom I wouldn't have stopped for anything.<br /><br />Still, Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard do a nice job in their rolls.  In fact, I'd say solid acting all the way around with some supporting rolls being just outstanding.<br /><br />The uniforms, weapons, and other equipment appear to all be accurate and authentic.  This is a real import thing to me as we've all watched movies with American tanks painted desert yellow pretending to be Rommel's panzers.  The only glaring mistake is using three trainer aircraft to represent German fighter planes.  But, hey, how many actual German fighters still existed in 1965.  I'd bet very few so the use of trainers, while unfortunate, is understandable.<br /><br />For a movie made more than 40 years ago, it's still very much worth watching.
I think the cast of stars was exceptionl. The acting superb.The attire worn by the allies and Germans authentic. I would rate this film with the all time greats... Twelve Oclock High, Sahara,GI Joe,Casa Blanca,Purple Heart.Home of the brave.Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill,Judgement at Nuermberg,The Long Hot Summer...
This is a terrible movie version of a pretty exciting book. Frank Sinatra was and never could be Joseph Ryan. He was totally miscast in this role. I have a feeling he was a producer who acquired the rights for himself thinking that he could play the part. So wherever you are, Frankie, it didn't work!
It has been said of Sinatra, not a nice person off screen but on screen, always dependable and in charge of the situation. He even outshadowed the venerable Trevor Howard in this one. As a drama, very good and as a war movie, good again. Interesting locations like the old ruins. Back to Sinatra, seen many movies with him and never a bad one.
My apologies in advance to the legion of fans out there, but somehow the idea of a &quot;good&quot; Frank Sinatra film seems oxymoronic.  But this is a fine film, with Sinatra believable as the American martinet, and a simply outstanding supporting cast.  I must single out for special mention the wonderful performance by Edward Mulhare, a much underrated actor, who rarely had the opportunity to show what he could do.  His performance as Father Costanza is a gem, and one of the elements that makes this movie really work (and his German is excellent!).
