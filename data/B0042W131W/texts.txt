Early & I mean Early Jack nicholson !!! - Not a bad movie for It's Time But You can Find it The budget racks of Dollar Stores & Big Lt's For a Pitance !!!! I'm not Sure it may even be Public Domain ? in which case you can Download it For Free Legally ! I'd not pay much more than @ bucks for The Terror Personally FWIW ?
This is an absolutely terrible movie, but well worth having in the collection if only to see Jack Nicholson slim and with hair and young. Made in 5 days, yes only 5 days, on the sets used for The Raven, this is one of the best bad films ever made, and as such is hugely enjoyable. Consider it as part of Corman's Edgar Allen Poe series and you will know what you are getting.It's quite short too.....
