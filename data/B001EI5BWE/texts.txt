While I consider this the best of all the Dick Tracy serials I have to say it's not faithful to the comics. To begin with Tracy was changed from a police officer to a FBI agent for all four films. None of the characters from the comics except Tracy himself appear in all 4 serials. Even Tracy's sweetie Tess Trueheart had her name changed to Gwen for the first 3 serials. And Gwen was played by 3 different & very unattractive actresses to boot! The final serial saw this lady's name changed again this time to June Chandler. At least June is played by a very beautiful blonde actress named Jan Wiley. The Ghost wasn't a villain from the comics but he may as well have been. He's every bit as bizarre & deadly as the Mole Pruneface Flattop etc. His ability to make himself invisible makes him even more fascinating! The serial also has some of the best cliffhangers I've ever seen. Be sure to check this one out! It's the best of the batch!
Well, I think so anyway.  Bill Witney and John English directed the three sequels to the original and established themselves and Repulic studios as masters of the serial genre with the choreographed fights, well crafted chapter endings, and overall care in making these entertaining.I put this one above the other Dick Tracy serials because they really outdid themselves in packing it with continuous action and imaginatively crafted scenes including ones in the middle of chapters which rivaled the chapter endings.  This one does have a higher body count than most serials.  There are six suspects who may be the invisible "Ghost" at the beginning and only two still alive by the start of the final chapter.One very unusual thing to note is that unlike most of Republic's crime serials, there is no "economy chapter" in which we have flashbacks to scenes in previous chapters.If you enjoy serials, you should love this one.
"Dick Tracy vs. Crime Incorporated" is a 15 chapter Republic serial, the last of the four with Ralph Byrd as Dick Tracy, released in late December of 1941.  It is also the last of the 17 serials directed by the team of William Witney and John English.<br /><br />A mysterious criminal, known as "The Ghost" seeks revenge on members of the "Council of Eight" who helped send his brother, "Rackets" Regan, to the Chair.  They had planned to build a vast orgnization, called "Crime, Incorporated" which now The Ghost, secretly a member of the Council, will carry out alone, with the aid of an invisibility machine developed by his associate, Lucifer (John Davidson).  As the story begins, two members of the Council have already been killed, and Tracy arrives too late to save criminologist Dr. Stephen Chandler (Howard C. Hickman), killed at close range despite being heavily guarded.  While Tracy and the police are baffled, they had noticed an odd sound, caused by Lucifer's invisibility machine.  Tracy spends the next fourteen chapters tracking that sound, battling the Ghost's schemes and trying to learn his identity.<br /><br />For purposes of the serial the acting is fine, with Ralph Byrd as reliable as ever as the square-jawed detective/G-man, supported mostly by agent Bill Carr played by Michael Owen.  Instead of Gwen, the main female role is June (Jan Wiley), the daughter of the late Dr. Chambers, but she appears no more often than Gwen did in the other serials.  She finally gets to do something in Chapter Ten, analyzing the sound of Lucifer's machine.  Jan Wiley had better roles in Universal's 1945 serials "Secret Agent X-9" and "The Master Key."  The actors for the remaining members of the Council of Eight are Hooper Atchley, Robert Fiske, Robert Frazer, Ralph Morgan and John Dilson, all good at playing suspicious characters.  The Ghost is supported not only by John Davidson as Lucifer, but Anthony Warde as the main henchman John Corey.  A lot of familiar faces show up in smaller roles, including Edmund Cobb, C. Monague Shaw, Stanley Price, John Merton, Jack Mulhall and Edward Hearn, plus stunt men David Sharpe, Duke Taylor, Ken Terrell and Bud Wolfe.<br /><br />Those looking for a lot of action will not be disappointed, but little logic is used in solving the case, and Tracy seems to be waiting with the audience to see which Council member is left in the last chapter.  Screenplay writers Ronald Davidson, Norman S. Hall and Joseph Poland were also involved with the earlier "Adventures of Captain Marvel" which had a similar "Who Is.." plot, but here Tracy is supposed to be protecting those Council members.  While there are no "retrospective" chapters, there's a lot of recycled footage.  The first chapter ends with the destruction of New York City by tidal wave, taken from the 1933 film "Deluge," though the associated new footage doesn't quite look right.  Maybe the palm trees lining the streets were the wrong kind for New York.  Most chapters contain extra "cliffhangers" at the mid-point for added action, usually from an earlier serial, though often with a different resolution.  In the middle of Chapter Three the hero chases a runaway train in an army tank, from the second Dick Tracy serial.  Then we get a rerun of the first chapter cliffhanger from "Dick Tracy's G-Men" where a remote-controlled boat loaded with explosives is heading to destroy the canal locks.  To fit it into the story, a clumsy explanation is needed by Tracy, who is able to see from an airplane that dummies have been substituted for the people and that a remote-control unit is operating the boat.  Reuse of cliffhangers is not unusal in serials, but the amount of it is especially high for the time this one was made.  The "scientific" explanations related to The Ghost's invisibility don't enhance the credibility either, though there's entertainment in the rapid wearout of the tubes in Lucifer's machine.  Fortunately originality and plot aren't the only things that matter in serials, and Republic's production values are in top form, including the choreography of the fist fights and especially the musical score by Cy Feuer, the most pulse-pounding in the Dick Tracy serials.<br /><br />VCI's edtion on DVD, # 8526, is properly spread out on two discs, the first double-layer with chapters one through nine, the second disc having the remaining five chapters.  There is but one extra, an introduction by Max Allan Collins, who wrote the Dick Tracy comic strip from 1977 to 1993.  This is on the first disc but can only be accessed with the "play all" option; it does not appear on the main menu.  VCI's image is quite good, if from a reduction print, seen in the softness of focus toward the edges especially in the lower-right corner of the screen, with blurred words "fictitious" and "coincidental" in the disclaimer about the similarity to persons living or dead.  This is also the location of the MPPDA certificate numbers, and the one for Chapter Nine is quite blurry, though probably correct, like the ones for the other chapters.  But overall the sharpness, gray scale and lack of scratches and dirt are impressive.  The sound in Chapter One has some noise reduction artifacts causing the dialogue to be a little garbled, but VCI's videotape edition, # 1169 had the noise doing about the same thing.  The other chapters are better, clear enough if with some background hiss, a good compromise between noise and high-frequency enhancement.<br /><br />The other Dick Tracy serials are closer to the comic strip, with better atmosphere and plot development, and a lot less recycled footage.  Still, by Amazon's rating system "Dick Tracy vs. Crime, Inc." deserves five stars for the lively action and fine production values of the serial.  The blemishes are fairly minor, and this is the best-looking transfer of the four Dick Tracy serials on DVD.

this movie was made real well the story is a great one. ralph byrd is the best screen dick tracy but be on the look out for robert fiske as cabot he is also in the green archer and in the batman that came out 1943 so pick up those other movies too.
I know Republic had to be economy-minded, but this is ridiculous: Many of the cliffhangers are taken whole cloth from previous Dick Tracy serials.  I'm shocked that the great directors Witney and English would go along with such shoddiness, and surprised because until this one each Dick Tracy serial was better than the previous one.  Granted, it does have a completely new plot line, but too many scenes are stolen from the previous three Tracys for my taste.  Even when the cliffhangers aren't repeats they're not very good, certainly not typical of Witney and English's work.  There's one pretty good cliffhanger in Chapter 12, but the one in Chapter 14 is a non-event.<br /><br />Incidentally, this final Dick Tracy marks the longest running serial series in film history, with a total of 60 chapters.  Ralph Byrd was a fine actor, and he made his mark in serial history with this series.  Frankly, in this one he looks like he was getting a little tired of the role.<br /><br />Jan Wiley, who was quite good in "Secret Agent X-9" (1945), is pretty wooden in this one, just hanging around in the great tradition of Tracy's previous assistants.<br /><br />If I hadn't seen the previous three Tracys I probably would have rated this a little higher, but I can't get over the perfidy of adding all those scenes from previous serials.  It completely spoiled the whole movie for me.  Heck, even the title is a misnomer, as the plot isn't really about an organization called Crime, Inc., but rather a criminal called the Ghost who can make himself invisible.  Frankly, I guessed his identity pretty early on:  I recognized his voice both as the Ghost and from a previous serial with the same actor, and furthermore the credits give him away.
Its Dick Tracy, its a 1940's serial, its so unique and good (To Me) OK, could be a little less but still I bought it. Always easy doing business on Amazon. I love Amazon if it exists, they or their Partners have it. Shipping and delivery again great.
articles arrived quickley, and was securely packaged.<br />I feel very confident that I will order in the future and<br />will tell my friends about the quick and dependable way you do buisness.
Of the 4 Tracy serials this version is the best when it comes to plot and action. Many of the cliff hanging endings are original. A fine example of a serial of the period. Equal to the newly released Green Hornet/1940.
Just added this one to my collection. If your a Dick Tracy/Ralph Byrd fan get this one. VCI has done a truly remarkable job of digitally restoring this one. Not a flaw in any chapter, and the sound is excellent. Typical story line involving a single villain the "Ghost", and was similar to the 1937 edition with the "Spider" as the villain. In fact in Chapter 5 of this one they borrowed some footage from the 1937 serial. I'm referring to the harbor chase scene with the speedboat and the cabin cruiser and how they go between two large ships. The final escape was different though. Didn't think anyone would notice eh? I'm going to get more of these. Love Ralph Byrd as Dick Tracy.....I think he was Dick Tracy.
This is the 3rd of 4 Dick Tracy movie serials, as usual it features Ralph Byrd as Tracy, and that is pretty much where the similarity between the serials and the comic strip end.  And in typical serial fashion there are fights galore, lots of chasing, but it's all good fun, if you are interested in the Tracy serials, this wouldn't be the one to start with.  For some extra fun keep count of how many hats Dick loses throughout the 15 chapters!
