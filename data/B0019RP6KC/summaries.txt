Oh, Rats!
Great storytelling!
Rat salad anyone?
Rat zombies take control of NYC. Sure, why not?
After Dark is excellent, Kim Blair scintillates
Mulberry Street
Smart, Fun and Creepy
My favorite from last year's horrorfest
A surprisingly good indie-type film.
Rat-a-tat Fantastic
Forget that it was an After Dark Selection!
A solid Zombie film that isn't a Zombie Film, but really breaks the mold!
What's That Scratching Sound? AAAAAGHH!!!...
Could have been awesome. Doesn't quite get there.
Were-Rats? Freakin Sweet!
Rat-People!
And to think that we saw them die on Mulberry Street...
One of my favorites
A really decent film..
The Horror of the Rats
Surprisingly great
Welcome to the Rat Race
"Burn Hollywood Burn.......Long live the Independents!!!!!"

Mulberry Street

Mulberry Street - Another Horror Surprise
Don't expect a masterpiece and you will be happy.
So much potential.
A diamond in the rough!!

worst of the series
Another Crappy Zombie Film!!!
Rent it on NetFlix someday.
america's critic
Competent acting but weak execution
A Zombie film that breaks the mold.....NOT!
STUPID, STUPID RAT CREATURES!
Worst Movie Ever! Besides The Strangers
