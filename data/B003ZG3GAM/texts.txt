The Reaper is a fantastic show filled with wild scenarios on how Sam and friends have to catch the different souls that escaped from Hell.  The only downside of the show was it only lasted two seasons.  I already bought the show in HD via Xbox Live.  Glad to see it on Amazon.com VOD.  I would have bought from here first if it was available at the time.  Wish show would come out on Blu-ray.  Season 2 even got better when the guys move out and get their own apartment.  Kevin Smith directed the pilot episode. Enjoy.
