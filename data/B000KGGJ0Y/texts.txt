I remembered seeing this movie with my parents when I was a child. I always remembered Lew Ayres &amp; the final moments of the movie - powerful, but it brought tears to my eyes. Compared to todays war movies, it is dated, but it is a must if you want to know what movies were like back in the 1930's. Lew Ayres portrays the young soldier with conviction, and you are taken back to the 1st WW and what many of our fathers/grandfathers went through. There are scratches, even on the DVD version, yet you know it's part of the 1930's so you don't mind. A great movie for anyones collection.
Third quarter of Sophomore world cultures is devoted to WWI.  As a teacher, the high point of the entire school year is tying the book, events, and movie together.  The movie is so tightly scripted that it  becomes easy for my students to follow each chapter as we look at it  through the eyes of the camara.  Black and white and poor sound did not  take away from the incredible story; my students were pinned to their  seats.  All were awestruck when the French advanced on the German trenches,  and several cried when Paul died.  I've seen this movie dozens of times,  yet it still moves me.
I can only re-iterate the comments passed by most of your other reviewers,  a real master piece. Dated? maybe, the acting is of another age. but for all that the story and cine-matic quality reigns amongst the greatest of all time. The 1st world war is seen through a young, ordinary lad at first enthusiastic to serve his nation after a barrage of lecturing  led by his school master on how glorious to wear a uniform with the girls flocking at your feet, the pride of the nation,ect,ect. He and most of his school mates join up only to be confronted with the reality of trench warfare.The story is quite straight forward but interwoven are really great episodes eg: we digress from the characters  to follow a pair of boots as they are worn by various soldiers each one loosing them through death.<br />There are no glorious deaths no famous last words just the passing of a few  young men out of the 9,000,000 who's lives ended between 1914 and 1918.<br />The final scene is a classic in film history.<br />The anti war message is as strong now 73 years after its release as it was then.<br />For those who have not seen this film and are real art lovers<br />this is a must buy for any film collection.<br />For me i just think it,s in the top 5 best films of all time and definately the best war movie ever made.
This is a more realistic view of war, instead of the War Hero type movies you may be used to watching.  The reviewer below who wrote &quot;As always, the book is better&quot;(someone by the name of Claire) complained about the sound and the fact that it was in black and white.  I don't know if Claire knows it (let alone would care) but I believe this was the 1st movie with sound throughout the entire picture and no subtitles (the original Jazz Singer came out a year before Western Front, but even though it featured Al Jolson's vocals, all dialouge was in subtitles).  Not only that, the war scenes (used by a revolving crane) introduced a new form of cinematography.  A Cinema professor showed it in class when discussing the beginning of the sound era in movies.  Lew Aires (who was 22 during the filming of Western Front) plays Paul Baumer, a soldier during World War I on the side of Germany.  As the movie begins, a teacher over-enthusiastically exhorts his students to fight for their country.  So Paul enlists and leaves enthusiastically to serve in battle. However, while seeing many of his comrades die in battle and after killing an &quot;enemy&quot; doesn't seem to be all it's cracked up to be, Paul has a change of heart. The DVD version talks about the original book written by Erich Maria Remarque and some of what went on the set and features biographies of the cast members and director Lewis Milestone.
I am going through a phase where I want to see every movie that the so-called Academy granted &quot;Best Picture&quot;.  This film won in 1929 and I think was the third such feauture to receive this honor.  The quality of the DVD is good when you think of how old the film is.  The poor quality that arrives at times adds to the history of the film and film making in general.  I wouldn't watch it without it. <p>This is a war film that makes no claims to be anything else.  It brings to life the realistc brutality, comradeship and emotional strains involved with living on the battlefield.  The film makers did a tremendous job on recreating war in France while filming just outside Hollywood.  The explosives are real.  Turn up the volume.  The non-stop bombing might just begin to brush your nerves as if you were there.
AS A VIETNAM (HELICOPTER CREWCHIEF AND DOOR GUNNER) VETERAN, I ENCOURAGE ANY YOUNG OR ANY AGE MAN OR WOMAN FASCINATED WITH THE GLORY OF WAR TO SEE THIS MOVIE, THIS IS THE REALITY OF WAR AND IT'S TRUTH AND UGLINESS IN RAW FORM! EACH GENERATIONAL WAR IS FOUGHT DIFFERENTLY WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE WAYS IT IS FOUGHT TECHNICALLY, AND AS I WATCHED THIS MOVIE I COULD ONLY IMAGINE THE REALITY OF WHAT THESE WWI SOLDIERS MUST HAVE REALLY WENT THROUGH LIVING AND FIGHTING "IN AND OUT OF THE TRENCHES" IN EUROPE AT THIS TIME! THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THIS CLASSIC WWI WAR FILM IS CELEBRATED WITH THIS FIRST CLASS PRESENTATION OF A TWO DISC SET (BLU-RAY AND DVD) IN "BOOK" FORM. INCLUDED INSIDE IS A VERY INFORMATIVE BOOKLET ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT MOVIE WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY "LEONARD MALTIN", PLUS MOVIE FACTS AND HISTORY, BIO'S ON THE DIRECTOR AND THE STARS IN THIS MOVIE, ORIGINAL MOVIE POSTERS, SCENE PHOTOS AND MUCH MORE THAT I REALLY ENJOYED VIEWING! OVER THE YEARS I HAVE VIEWED THIS GREAT WWI MOVIE ON TV, AND HAVE PURCHASED THE VHS, AND REGULAR DVD, AND HAVE EXPERIENCED IT'S CINEMATIC FLAWS DUE TO IT'S AGE AND HANDLING, BUT THIS "BLU-RAY" PRESENTATION "MASTERFULLY RESTORED BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS" IS THE BEST YET! IT IS TOTALLY CLEANED UP, SHARP IN FOCUS AND RICHLY ENHANCED IN B&W SATURATION, A JOB VERY WELL DONE FOR THIS 1929/1930 ACADEMY AWARD WINNER(S) FOR "BEST PICTURE" AND "BEST DIRECTOR, LEWIS MILESTONE", AND THE FIRST "ALL TALKING" (NON-MUSICAL) FILM TO WIN THE ACADEMY AWARD. THE ONLY FLAW WITH THIS RESTORED BLU-RAY VERSION OF THIS WWI WAR MOVIE IS THE SOUND QUALITY, BUT AGAIN I CONSIDER THE AGE AND TECHNOLOGY OF WHEN THIS FILM WAS MADE. A GREAT BUY AND A VERY NICE ADDITION TO MY MOVIE COLLECTION!
I just watched this for the first time, and it really is a film that ages well. Sure the quality of the film and sound is somewhat hard to watch due to the extreme age, but the story still impresses today.<br /><br />I know this story is famous as an anti-war message, but I don't necessarily see that when watching the movie. If it is strictly viewed as anti-war, then I would not really agree with it politically. (I sure don't think war is good, but it is necessary at times.) And when I see this film, I see a story that points out the evil and ugliness of war. I think it's good to be reminded of that to keep our priorities straight.<br /><br />All told, this film is well-made, and it perfectly illustrates the ugly side of war. I would recommend this to anyone.
All Quiet On The Western Front won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1930 and it deserved to win. This movie is far and away the best "early talkie" I've ever seen. The plot moves along at a good pace and the action scenes could not have been better planned or filmed. We see the horrors of war and the film sends the clear message that war is very bad to say the least.<br /><br />When the action starts, we see German Professor Kantorek (Arnold Lucy) telling his class that it is an honor to fight; and he adds that there will be glory for them if they join the German army and fight in World War One. As he does this, troops marching off to war parade in front of the school as if war was all about impressing the young ladies. Practically the whole class of young men signs up to fight--and that's where the real action begins.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that this was a 1930s version of "Saving Private Ryan;" and they are right. The battle scenes that inevitably follow show the horrors of war with rampant death and destruction of cemeteries, villages and countryside. We see the very young men soon finding out that war is not some easy little game; they also learn just how fast they can die--and how they must kill without mercy if they are immediately confronted by an enemy soldier.<br /><br />In particular, we see much of the action through the eyes of a young German soldier named Paul B&auml;umer (Lew Ayres). Paul begs a French soldier for forgiveness after he mortally wounds him but it's too late--the soldier has died. Paul promises the dead soldier that he'll help his widowed wife and daughter; but that may be hard for Paul to actually do given the circumstances. We see war buddies breaking up in tears during their first "bombardment;" and they must kill huge colonies of rats infesting their bunkers which are barely holding back flying shrapnel and flying dirt as the bombs hit.<br /><br />Not all of the other characters are developed to the same degree as Paul; but one that is would be Kat Katczinsky (Louis Wolheim). On the surface, Kat seems to have a pretty tough hide but deeper down he's an amiable fellow who really wants the war to be over just as much as Paul does. We also get to know Franz Kemmerich (Ben Alexander) who suffers the fate of having his leg amputated after an injury, much to the horror of Paul and the other young men from their school. Another interesting character is Himmelstoss the mailman (John Wray) who becomes ridiculously obsessed with his "authority" as a Sergeant who is actually petrified of war and who eventually gets told by a soldier not to cry about "a scratch" that he gets. In addition, look for a good performance by Beryl Mercer who plays Paul's mother Mrs. B&auml;umer.<br /><br />The DVD doesn't come with many extras; we get an introduction by Robert Osbourne and there are subtitles. However, the movie is so well done and so well restored that I can overlook this.<br /><br />All Quiet On The Western Front sent home the message that war is full of horrors, death and destruction. We see soldiers on all sides trying desperately just to stay alive and of course there is no respect for one's fellow human being. I highly recommend this film; it would be quite a fine addition to your DVD collection.
All Quiet on the Western Front is an excellent adaptation of the Erich Maria Remarque novel about the horrors of war. It follows several German students from the classroom into the trenches as they die one by one. The story features many random stories depicting one boy, Paul Malvern's (Lew Ayres) experiences similarly to the way the book was organized. There are many powerful scenes, like boys going mad in the trenches, the sickening experience of the boys' first battle, and Paul killing a man up close.<br /><br />Because this film was made at the beginning of the "golden age of Hollywood," viewers might expect it to be highly sentimental and preachy. Although its anti-war message is blatant, it is surprisingly underplayed and straight-forward.<br /><br />The first few times I tried to watch this film I was put off almost immediately. The sound quality suffers because the film was made so early in the talkie era. The opening scene where the teacher preaches to the students about the glories of war is a bit long. However, after that scene, I soon found myself glued to the screen. Give the film a proper chance before condemning it.
A powerful indictment of the tragedy of WWI, as seen through the experience of a German squadron, drawn from an elite German school.  The bright-eyed enthusiasm and esprit de corps of the youthful recruits is relentlessly ground down under the weight of bombardments, starvation, grime, bloodshed and indifference.  As the film's hero, Paul, declares in his famous speech at the film's end, dying for one's country isn't glorious -- "it's dirty and it's painful."  Beautifully shot in black and white, this film slowly, mercilessly, artfully rachets up the tension, with battle scenes and psychological dramas that are literally and figuratively gut-wrenching.  This celebrated film, made a decade after the end of the First World War, summed up the disillusioning pall the war cast upon its generation with much the same cathartic power as the movie "Platoon" would, more than half a century later.  It's pretty strong stuff, surprisingly so for the time; an early talkie, it suffers soundwise in scenes with dialogue, but is crushingly powerful in its use of battlefield sound effects.  Lew Ayres, who plays Paul, is both magnetic and intense, as his Leonardo Decaprio baby face hardens into an anger-filled John Wayne-ish mask.  Although this film established many of the conventions of the war genre, it did so  unsentimentally, thus escaping the cliched feel of its many imitators.
I read the book and saw the movie years ago. Since then I have been studying WWI and have visited the battle field.<br /><br />The more I know, the more I cannot understand. The carnage! The ossouary at Duamont.<br /><br />I compare this story with "Under Fire," the French novel, as well as "Paths of Glory." I think All Quiet is grittier than "Paths," and even though "All Quiet" was a Hollywood production, it feels like you are with the Germans.<br /><br />I particularly liked the charge over no man's land and the scene just beforeLouis Wolheim died. "We have no more young men. Our guns are all shot out. We have lost."
I saw this movie when AMC was showing it and I absolutley love it. It really has a good message. You watch gungho young kids wanting glory from the war and soon get to be hardened veterans and aged men, scared by war. A  truely remarkable movie that was revolutionary for it's time, it is  defineatley not a flag waver.
The film lacks profanity but it's characters do somehow come off three-dimensional all the same for a special reason I won't mention here. Check the film out and see why for yourself. Hint: it's in the last quarter of the film. I see the obvious German-expressionist influences in the film (fitting the film is all about Germans)especially early in the film with the teacher and his students.
Amazon's ad shows the Classic 1930 version of ALL IS QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, they sent the much later version with John Boy from the Walton's. It is a poor version and not worth the materials used to make it. Having Amazon involved with the deal we assumed we would have NO PROBLEMS. That was our first mistake, these were to be gifts and now we have no gifts because the wrong movie was sent and Amazon is still showing the wrong version on this ad. Even this review page shows the Classic 1930 MOVIE AND NOT THE ONE THAT THEY ARE SENDING OUT. BEWARE AND ASK OR CALL TO CONFIRM YOU ARE GETTING THE RIGHT MOVIE.
Based on Erich Maria Remarque's famous pacifist novel, All Quiet on the Western Front explores the horror of WWI through the eyes of a young German soldier.<br /><br />Ideas of glory fuelled by patriotism are quickly drowned in the mud-filled trenches of the battlefield. Young lives are squandered cheaply for a few centimeters of ground.<br /><br />WWI was fought with traditional tactics - the mass charge, trenches - but combined with more efficient killings machines - machine guns, field artillery - led to horrific loss of life among the soldiers.<br /><br />The Germans learnt from these mistakes in WWII and employed the tactics of the Blitzkreig "lightening war" where speed of movement was paramount.<br /><br />Back to the film itself. It's really easy to tell this is a child of the early sound era - there is lots of overacting and it is very visual in its telling. Modern audiences will find it very heavy-going though.<br /><br />Still it has an ageless anti-war message. An important part of film history but very much an antique now.
I didn't think this was particularly well done... in comparison with the book it can't hold a candle. I was surprised at the good quality of the film, for being so old. I didn't think that most of the actors looked right for the parts, particularly Kat. And the movie dragged on and on and on....<p>I guess as I watched it I kept thinking of better ways this could have been filmed to coincide better with the powerful impact of the story. <p>See it if you like, but I really can't recommend it...
I read the book first, several times.  It's my favorite.  This movie is stagey, and hard for people used to modern sound and color to watch.  It's a great story, but so much more is in the book.  It's more about Paul's personal change during the course of fighting, not so much about action so I find you get so much more out of reading the book.  Much more emotional, and you get to envision the characters as you like (I hate having a picture in my head and then the movie is completely different!)  The 1979 version with Richard Thomas is better, if just for the improved cinematography.
Received DVD fairly quickly; however the DVD has several damaged places on it that would not play and I had a hard time getting past them.  I would have returned it, but I had already thrown the packaging away.
All Quiet on the Western Front has finally gotten the DVD that it deserves. After languishing for years in a stopgap DVD release that was difficult to hear and had terrible picture quality, this classic anti-war film has been restored by the Library of Congress and digitally remastered. The results are fantastic.<br /><br />Note: This review refers to the new Universal Cinema Classics release (black case with close-up of Lew Ayres), not some of the older releases (bluish monochrome case with a German helmet) which Amazon has seen fit to post this review on.<br /><br />Picture: Huge improvement. The previous release was dull, low-resolution, sometimes blurry, and reproduced lots and lots of distracting scratches and dirt from old reels. Now the picture is crisp, very sharp, and as clean as it has ever been.<br /><br />Sound: Another huge improvement. The 1930-vintage sound effects are still rather clunky and the dialogue is hard to understand once or twice, but overall the restoration is a phenomenal improvement. Very good.<br /><br />There are no special features to speak of, although the DVD does include a later, probably 1940s-era trailer and an introduction from Turner Classic Movies' resident film historian Robert Osborne. The restoration of the sound and image are the big selling points, here.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say is pretty trivial--there is no chapter menu. This is only a minor concern, though, and in no way detracts from the quality of the DVD or the film itself. If you've been waiting for a good release of All Quiet on the Western Front or have never seen it, this is the DVD and now is the time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
This reviewer give this move 5 stars.  It is actually 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Some people will say the movie's black and white color is distracting.  This the Great War we are watching.  Only the paintings were color.  Color photography was not invented yet.  So it actually enhances the feel of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a great.  It completely captures what trench warfare was like.  It was a muddy, miserable life with rats and little food.  Somebody was always shooting at you.  That is trench warfare.<br /><br />The basic plot is about a school student, Paul, who is convinced by his school teacher to join and fight with the army in 1915.  The class enlists in mass, goes through training together, and then march off to fight at the Western front.<br /><br />The movie is like chapters in a book.  Most Americans don't understand what old Germany was like.  Old Germany was a land of Christian values.  The Kaiser (translation:  the emperor) was seen as a direct official working under God's blessing.  The family of Germany was the center of society.  All students were good in school or properly learned their jobs.  They obeyed their parents and the Church.  Old Germany was quite highly though of in pre-WWI America.<br /><br />The fact that Paul was in high school (gymnasium)  proves he was an exceptional student.  In Germany the poorly performing students are sent to trade school.  Paul's being in gymnasium proves he is one of the more intellectually advanced students.<br /><br />Yes, this movie is shot in America.  However, the sets look like they were made in old Europe.  There are cobblestone roads, the signs are in German, the writing on the chalk board is in old German script, and the soldiers sing German folk tunes.  The movie is like a time machine to another age.  Even a graveyard looks like a European graveyard, not American.  The technical lenghts this movie goes through is nearly boundless.<br /><br />The shown German basic training was quite realistic.  Why?  An American army unit would band together people from all over the nation.  Strength through diversity and all that.  Germany was much more realistic.  They had training centers in every "state".  This had advantages in training because the Germans started with a much more heterogeneous group and later subordinated the unit to a greater good, such as their division.  In America there are racial, regional (like Texas vs New York), and religious problems which never were worked out in WWI or WWII.  Thus Paul and his group are much more worried about their Oberfreiter (sergeant) and conforming to the norms of their assigned army unit than a likewise American unit would be during that time period.  So, Paul's unit training as a cohort is quite correct.<br /><br />And Paul's unit joining the front lines is quite realistic.  They go from being a group of trainees to veterans very fast after being caught in an artillery bombardment.  The wire laying detail is quite correct. When Corporal Katczinsky is smoking his pipe watching the operation that's correct.  Pipes don't have the glow of a cigarette at night time, the walls of the pipe mask the burning.<br /><br />The technical details on this movie are fantastic.  The soldiers actually eat at a real German food kitchen.  The Soldier's equipment is what the Imperial German Army actually wore in the war.  The European villages are quite convincing sets.  The artillery bombardments look so good that out takes of the scenes are used in other war movies.  Take note of this, the German Army in WWI and WWII did not do a very good job of feeding their soldiers.  The German army felt a well fed soldier would not want to fight.  The logic was the famished German soldiers would at least raid the enemies lines for food.  In real life the underfed Germans had to loot the locals.  They were all starving.  This leads up to a very strong scene with some French girls.<br /><br />Another underrated scene is inside of the German Bier Garten (bar).  The sausage, pickles, and snacks the Germans ate was quite accurate.  The posters on the wall are all quite correct for the period.  The German soldiers are all singing a happy German beer drinking song.  I loved this snapshot of old Germany.<br /><br />The friendship between Paul and Katczinsky is quite believable.  Katczinsky is a working man from Eastern Germany.  Paul is a soon-to-be-playwright.  However, these two divergent characters soon develop a strong friendship almost immediately.<br /><br />This movie closely follows the book, but not exactly.  The movie didn't have the time.<br /><br />Now, as a child this reviewer was taught that the Great War, WWI, was not that significant.  Actually, it's the most significant war of the 20th Century.  It is the start of a 20 year period of warfare in Europe, with some minor breaks, that ends with Soviet troops standing in the pulverized rubble of Berlin.<br /><br />Everything is gone by 1945.  The royalty of Europe is destroyed (You think Prince Charles is in the same League as King George?).  The families are shattered by war.  The land is laid waste.  The Christian faith went from over 95% church attendance to less than 10% in less than 60 years:  the wars destroyed the faith in King, Country, and God.  Europe was the pearl of Western Civilization in 1910.  By 1945 millions were dead and Europe was reduced to a minor player in the world stage.<br /><br />The movie is an analog of real life.  The best that Western civilization can offer is destroyed and all that exists in the end is destruction and death.<br /><br />This is a must see movie.  It should be part of every military historians library.
Winner of the 1930 Oscars for Best Picture and Director, "All Quiet on the Western Front" remains a stunning and timely film.  Based on Erich Maria Remarque's classic anti-war novel, the movie follows a group of patriotic German schoolboys as they are urged to enlist in World War I, and shows how their initially idealistic spirits are forever changed by the brutal reality of death and dismemberment, suffering and sorrow.  Beautifully acted by its entire cast (with special kudos going to Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim, and Slim Summerville), the film also features some incredible special visual effects (those two detached hands clinging to the barbed wire fence never fail to shock) and some meticulously staged battle scenes that manage to put the viewer into the heart of the action.  Arthur Edeson's cinematography is often truly astonishing in its artistry; his visual choices are impeccable.  Worth a special note is the film's soundtrack; how incredible the terrible sounds of exploding ammunition must have seemed to audiences in 1930, who had first heard Al Jolson speak in 1927's part-talkie, "The Jazz Singer"!  The very last sound effect in the film, which abruptly and startlingly leads to the close of the movie, is superbly executed and remains an innovative use of sound technology.<br /><br />The Universal DVD release of this film features a great sound transfer: on my six-speaker system, the rumbling explosions, staccato machine guns, and whizzing bullets sounded remarkably nearby.  Sadly, the visual transfer was sorely lacking; the source was plagued by jumps, scratches, lines, and breaks throughout the film, and the contrast was sometimes out-of-balance.  This cinematic masterpiece demands and deserves to be fully restored, and then remastered and rereleased on DVD. (Are you listening, Universal Home Video?)  The DVD extras include production notes; cast and director biographies and filmographies; and a Theatrical Trailer from one of the film's many reissues.  Warts and all, this DVD edition is definitely worth a look - the film's brilliance is such that it shines above and beyond this rather shoddy presentation.<br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />*** 2011 UPDATE ***:  My original review was based on the first DVD release, which bears a 1999 copyright.  Apparently, the powers that be at Universal WERE listening to those of us that criticized this flawed DVD transfer.  I've recently purchased and watched the 2007 "Universal Cinema Classics" remastered version, which features an introduction by film historian and TCM host Robert Osborne, and was gratified to note that the video has been significantly improved.  Cheers to the team at Universal Studios for finally doing justice to this landmark film!  This newly restored edition, which in addition to Osborne's introduction also includes the Theatrical Trailer, is unquestionably the one you'll want to own.  It comes highly recommended, without reservations.
For a movie in the 1930's, Lewis Milestone's adaptation of All Quiet On The Western Front, based on Erich Maria Remarque's novel, follows the book reasonably well.  However, rather than starting with the soldiers lining up to get the cook Ginger's stew per the novel (that part comes later), it starts with Paul Baumer's school teacher telling him and his fellow students that they are the light of the Fatherland, the iron men of Germany, the brave heroes who will repulse the enemies when called to do so.  In other words, he's exhorting them to enlist, which they do, pressed into patriotism in what was initially thought to have been a quick war with small losses.<p>From the start, the recruits are eager to get into uniform and to the front, and are puzzled by the behaviour of burned-out experienced soldiers like Tjaden and Kat.  This latter, a large, pleasantly ugly man has a knack for scrounging for food and finding enough for the group, and soon, all the recruits stick with and respect this man, especially after their first bombardment.  When one of the recruits realizes he has wet his trousers, Kat tells him not to worry about it, as it's happened to better men.<p>The stages of attacking, the bombardment, attack, counterattack, and repulse, is presented in graphic detail for that period, with the shots of men dying by artillery shells, being bayoneted, or machine-gunned.  Some recruits go crazy waiting in the bunker during the bombardment, and one of them rushes outside, only to get cut down by bullets.  And the aftermath isn't pretty for some.  Franz Kemmerich ends up in the infirmary and has his leg amputated.  From the grueling experience of phantom limb pain to the realization that one has lost his limb, the greed of some like Muller who wants Franz's nice boots, to the unconcern of the doctors who see Franz's death as another free bed, war is hell.<p>War changes people's perspectives.  Paul fights and stabs a French soldier at close quarters in a foxhole, and he pleads and apologizes to the dying man, telling him that without these uniforms, they could be friends, and promising to write to his wife.  And on leave, Paul is clearly alienated from the older civilians who have no clue that war has burned out his soul, and just keep telling him to give those Frenchies a licking and push on to Paris.  I'd go for Tjaden's solution to war:  get the politicians and generals wearing just their underpants into a big field and fight it out with clubs.  But the discussion of the soldiers yields something still relevant:  manufacturers want a war to sell more arms.<p>The subplot involving the butterflies is new, but the shot of the soldier reaching for the butterfly before being shot by a sniper symbolizes a soldier's whose burned out soul is suddenly heartened as seeing something beautiful, and suddenly thus illuminated within, reaches toward it.<p>All Quiet On The Western Front deservedly went on to win four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, in the US.  However, Joseph Goebbels' antics in Berlin demonstrates how Germany was in a state of war denial.  The incident at a theatre of the second night showing of the movie involved Goebbels' men starting disturbances and yelling anti-Semitic epithets that resulted in the film's termination after ten minutes.  Goebbels hadn't even seen the film;  he merely wanted to demonstrate Nazi power in Berlin and discredit Albert Grzesinski, Prussia's Interior Minister who was a Social Democrat.  When the film was banned by the Board of Censors because it "endangered Germany's image abroad", the headlines of Goebbels' newspaper Der Angriff (German for The Attack) read "Grzesinski Defeated."<p>One of the few war films I'll watch due to its pacifist message, denouncing the glorification of war.  The prologue at the movie's beginning, taken from Remarque's book, says it all:  this story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all, an adventure.  For death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it.  It will try simply to tell of a generation of men, who even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.
The film begins with a group of German schoolboys, including the film&#65533;s main star Paul, listening to a statement by their teacher about why they should join the army. Outside, a group of soldiers are parading down the street to cheering crowds and parading music. Filled with images of the glory and honor of serving in the war, the boys decide to enlist. After their military training, they arrive at the front where they learn all there is for them is hunger, fear and death. They fight rats as well as the enemy and they watch the slaughter of soldiers from both sides and even kill some of them. In one moving moment, Paul kills a French soldier and stays in a blast crater with the dying soldier, asking for forgiveness.  <p>Among one of the other powerful scenes is when Paul goes on leave and returns to his town. There, he visits his former teacher, who is giving another lecture to another group of students about why they should join the army. When asked to talk about the war, Paul says &#65533;We live in the trenches and we fight. We try not to be killed. Sometimes we are-That&#65533;s all&#65533;. He is booed at by the boys who see him as a coward. Meanwhile, when he talks with a group of old-timers, he is told to push on to Paris. After fighting for too long, he fells that the only place he is conformable at is at the front. When he returns back to his unit, he finds that only a few remain and most of those are recruits who were once like him: Boys who found the front to be different from what they thought it would be. <p>It is obvious that this movie was made in 1930. &#65533;Talkies&#65533; had been around for only a few years, so silent-era acting was still widely present. The special effects in the film are also not as realistic as today. The scenes are filmed in black and white with scratches visible in some scenes. But All Quiet on the Western Front has not dated when it comes to its power. It is (Along with Platoon and Saving Private Ryan) the best anti-war movie ever made.
I have seen All Quiet on the Western Front a couple of times this past year (bless DVDs) and am amazed at how powerful it still through repeated viewings.  It is a bleak movie, to be sure, although there are a number of moments of humour, but it still is compulsively watchable.  The movie does not seem to have aged as badly as many other movies from the thirties and this is one movie that benefited greatly by being filmed before the Production Code crackdown a couple of years later.  It would be decades before a Hollywood movie was as truly honest about war as this one.  The performances are generally quite good, particularly considering the youth and inexperience of much of the cast notably the lead, Lew Ayres.  The DVD does not come with many extras and there is no commentary, which is unfortunate, but the film itself is still a masterpiece and one of the finest war movies made.
All Quiet On the Western Front is my all time favorite movie. Lew Ayres stars as Paul Baumer with Lewis Wolheim as Katczinsky or &quot;Kat&quot;. This has some pretty good battle scenes for 1930, but the sounds of the shells hitting the ground isn't that realistic, but like I said it's 1930. This film won 2 Academy Awards including Best Picture(1929-1930). When director Lewis Milestone went up on stage to receive the award, some guy (don't remember his name) told Milestone that the next award the film would win would be the Nobel Peace Prize, because the film is anti-war. This movie is also #54 on AFI'S 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. I have now seen this 17 times and still counting and I'm not one bit tired of it. Every single scene, even though I've seen it a million times, still holds my attention whenever I see it. I would recommend this on DVD over VHS, because the bonus features contain the original theatrical trailer, and has short bios about the stars who played in it, and production notes. I love this movie so much I could run down the streets telling everyone I see to go see this film. Well now that you know about it go buy it NOW.
This movie, based on the Remarque novel, is the quintissential anti-war film. Released shortly after sound was crawling its way through the art of motion pictures, it threw the whole world on its ear. Later on in the 1930's, Adolf Hitler decreed that the film not be shown in Nazi Germany, due to its &quot;defeatist&quot; and &quot;unpatriotic&quot; view of World War I, which Hitler fought in with some level of distinction. One could say that the dictator's dislike of the film ensures that it is a great film--and it is. Lew Ayres plays a young German man who is highly influenced by a teacher who sings the praises of the German military, which desperately needs young men to fight for &quot;the Fatherland.&quot; He finds out after extensive and grueling drilling by a haughty officer that glory in battle demands a high price. However, once in actual combat, he finds out the reality of war is so much different:it is actually undignified, uninspiring, frightening, and eventually demoralizing. For its time, the movie does a fantastic job of bringing across the horror of World War I, showing with heavy intensity the meat grinder battles in the slit trenches, the guilt that comes with killing your enemy in hand-to-hand combat, realizing he is a human being also; yet also displaying the boredom and fright of the beaten-down boys (who become men way too fast) in between battles. The end is very poignant and I will not play spoiler for those who haven't seen it, but it involves the butterfly you see on the cover of the tape/DVD. I take off points for the sorry condition of some of the scenes; occasionally, the dialogue is hard to hear and the scenes jump a bit. Still, these should not distract the viewer from taking in the message the film offers. I do not agree wholly with the message, but it presents a unique vision of war's cost in the lives of men in their prime. For the ways in which the film does this, it should remain a classic for all time.
This 1930 film, based upon the novel by Erich Maria Remarque - which was directed by Lewis Milestone - made 22 year-old Lew Ayres a star and was responsible for George Cukor's  screen career (it also gave director Milestone international recognition).  A passionate portrayal of the horror of war, which for the first time depicted the &quot;hun&quot; as simply a simply a scared boy, this movie can be actually divided into four distinct parts.  The first details the enlistment of the young recruits; the second, their arrival on the front; the third - the various incidents of war; and, finally, the hero Paul Baumer's return home and his hastened retreat back to the front and his death.  The film is faithful to the Remarque novel and this was the first sound film to use a giant mobile crane which was most effective -  particularly for filming the realistically staged battle sequences.  It was actually 31  year-old Cukor who rehearsed the actors and established a neutrality ot their accents which is of inestimable value in putting across the production's emotional message.  Louis Wolheim is splendid as the brusque yet sympathetic Katczinsky while Raymond Griffith is memorable as the French soldier killed by Baumer.  ZaSu Pitts (!) was originally cast as Baumer's mother but preview audiences snickered at the very sight of her (her performance in GREED proved she was an excellent serious actress); unfortunately, the role was given to the whiney, saccharine Beryl Mercer.  Initially released at 140 minutes.
Adapted from the 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a WW1 German soldier  who changed his name to sound French, this film was made way back in 1930.  It was the beginning of the Depression, the use of sound in movies was new, and the feeling in the country was the WW1 had been the war to end all wars.  Now, 71 years later, the black and white film is scratchy, the gestures of the actors are over-exaggerated as if it were a silent film,  and the special effects of the battle scenes seem crude by today's standards.  In spite of all of this, however, this classic film brings its message home loud and clear.<p>This is the story of the young German men who were recruited to serve in the war though tales of glory and patriotism.  What they find is death, fear, hunger and the meaningless slaughter of young men of the same generation who happen to be wearing different uniforms.  In spite of the technical constraints, the film manages to get it all.  We see the hospitals where overworked doctors amputate limbs, we see the men being attacked by rats as well as the enemy, we see the dirt in the trenches and are moved by the hand-to-hand combat which leaves a young German soldier, played by Lew Ayes, confined in a foxhole with a dying French soldier.<p>I understand that the film was banned in Germany until after WW2 and I can certainly understand that it would have been counter to everything that happened next.  Through a historical context, this film was great, and its antiwar message a forerunner others to come.  There's a famous quote from the lips of one of the disheartened and weary soldiers when he says it all. &quot;Take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants and let 'em fight it out with clubs. The best country wins&quot;.  Too bad the world didn't listen.
I was appalled to see that this great classic has garnered but a single review. This movie is at the very top of the league, right along with Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now. By modern standards it is overacted, but I am willing to accept that as part of the standards of the day. I was stunned by the accuracy of the battle scenes -- given the limitations of moviemaking in those days, this movie was unblinkingly honest about the mechanics of warfare in World War One.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie to a viewer just looking for thrills. This is, by modern standards, a slow movie. Think of it as an exotic piece to be savored by the aficionado whose tastes have been refined by watching a broad range of movies.<br /><br />The movie is loaded with iconic moments that stick to your emotional ribs long after seeing it: the desperation with which the French girls tear into the food given them in exchange for their favors; the callousness of the orderly who tells Paul that Kat is dead; the desperate ferocity of hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches; the boots moving from owner to owner. But the final scene, almost maudlin by cynical modern standards, can still bring a lump to my throat.
Long before Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, a pacifist antiwar film dedicated to the soldier's point of view had them queuing round the block. An enormous critical and financial success, All Quiet On The Western Front was made in 1930 for the then enormous sum of $1.25m. The story of the inglorious fate of young German soldiers in the trenches of the Great War, it was made at a time when the actors and the public could remember the panic and the enormous numbers of dead. Thoroughly sensible and honest, this story claims to be 'neither an accusation, nor a confession, and least of all an adventure'. How many other war films have the guts to wear such a broken heart on their sleeve?
This review refers to the Universal DVD edition of "All Quiet on the Western Front"(1930)....<br /><br />I feel privileged that we are still able to view this beautiful film from 1930. It is a moving story of soldiers bonding through the horrors of war. The soldiers are German, the war is WWI, but it doesn't really matter what country they are from or which war it is, it is baby faced boys, going off to kill or be killed, and the physical and emotional scars they are left with.<br /><br />"All Quiet on the Western Front" won the Academy Award(1929/1930) for Best Picture and it was well deserved. Everything about it is amazing. The acting, the story, the photography, all combined for a film that will stand the test of time and will continue to mesmerize audiences always. Even without all the graphic effects used in today's war movies,Director Lewis Milestone and photographer Arthur Edeson, manage to convey a chilling look at the atrocities these soldiers must endure.The film's stars, Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim, John Wray and Slim Summerville are all exquiste in their portrayals, making us feel the emotions and anguish they are going through. They are characters you will really care about.Some of the immortal scenes, will touch you and stay with you for quite a while after the view.<br /><br />The film does show it's age. Although the picture itself is fairly sharp, there are many scratches and lines throughout.<br />I found myself so caught up in the story though, that these things didn't really bother me,The sound in DD2.0(MONO) is at times a bit muffled but very decent. I think the DVD is absolutely worth having for anyone who appreciates fine filmmaking, or any lover of good war(or anti-war) stories.The price now is more than reasonable for this classic treasure.<br />There are very informative production notes included on the making of the film, and the author(Erich Maria Remarque) of the book the film was based on. There are some biographical notes on a few of the stars as well. The DVD includes subtitles in English, French and Spanish.Universal has done a nice job in bringing this important piece of ciematic historty to DVD for all to enjoy.<br /><br />A must have for your classic film collection and one to view during the up coming Oscar season....Experience this beautiful film for yourself...Laurie<br /><br />also recommended is Milestone's look at the Korean War: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792841662">Pork Chop Hill</a><br />and more on war:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PR6">A Bridge Too Far</a> - wwii<br />and<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792853784">Windtalkers</a>(not one of the greatest, but good and historically important film)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078843361X">Into the DMZ A Battle History of Operation Hickory, May 1967, Vietnam</a>
I was just a young boy when I saw this.  I was into playing 'war' with the boys in my neighborhood.  I thought it was cool.  After seeing this movie, and subsequantly reading Erick Maria Remarque's book, I realized there is no glorious death in war.  There is only death.  The acting may be stiff, but the message is increasinly chilling.  I only wish our leaders could understand....
I am really sorry some people out there hated this film but it says more about them than the movie. I suggest they go back, get the latest Bond movie out and stop annoying people with their 'whining'. If you don't have  the attention span of a gnat and can make allowances for when the film was  made then buy it now.
It would be a mistake to think of this movie as a war movie rather it is the only true anti-war movie I've ever seen. Unlike most so-called anti-war movies there is no glory, no heroics and no over-dramatized deaths in this movie, it is perhaps the most realistic movie I've seen about war, or to put it more aptly, the most likely depiction of war. Put that doesn't mean this movie is boring or an escapade of Art, no this movie is both entertaining and chilling and it is definitely a movie you should see before you die, otherwise you'll regret it, as it will probably be one of Gods favorites, lousy hippie.
One of the most important war films ever made is this excellent adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's fine novel, directed by Lewis Milestone.  A group of eager German students enlist for service in World War I, heedless of  warnings from their professors and families.  These guys are just itching  to be heroes, and the army propaganda has promised them that they will be.  The cinematic ballet of war scenes is unlike anything cinema had seen  before, and the realism of war in this film is completely at odds with the  candy-coloured beauty of propaganda films made a decade later.  To make  sure World War II hopeful soldiers wouldn't be deterred by the gruesome  images seen here, this film was banned in America not only for its pacifism  but also because it presented German soldiers as sympathetic protagonists.
Director Lewis Milestone weaves a powerful tapestry of loss, defeat, and the meaninglessness of war in this, one of the great anti-war tracts on  film. Unfortunately, it may not have the same grip and impact on today's  audiences because much of the handling is dated (acting is very  early-talkie style; individual scenes are occasionally rather maudlin;  naivety is rampant); and the narrative is somewhat choppy. However, a  considerable amount of the power is in the visuals, and these are just as  impressive and striking today. Milestone's deployment of camera motion,  choreography of the battle scenes, and the sharp, gritty look, as well as  the well-spent budget create an emotional force that carries the picture  with smashing success through many of it's rough spots. Indeed, the grammar  of his film-making  seems to contain an expressionism perfectly augmenting  the story's spirit; and moments achieve a stunning texture that haunt the  mind (take the opening scene in the classroom; or the final shot as the  boys look right into our souls). Some have even compared its style to  Eisenstein and Lang! Patience and understanding will reward the viewer with  a deeply-felt appreciation of what it is like experiencing the  ever-continuing suicide of the human race, and a high regard for one of the  cinema's classics.
This is one of my favourite films of all time and it is certainly one of the best anti-meaningless war films ever.  If ever a film makes a strong case for war only as a very last resort, this one certainly ranks very highly indeed.  I had this on standard dvd and both the picture and sound qualities were terrible but I was able to forgive that at the time considering that it was released only 3 years after the very first talkie "The Jazz Singer" was released.  And so you can imagine my anticipation when I learned that a remastered version on 1080p Blu ray was going to be released and so I couldn't wait to pop the blu ray disc into my player when I first got this.<br /><br />Overall, this release is a mixed bag for me.  I like the digibook which is something I have always liked about blu rays and helps me to decide to double dip but I don't like the redundant standard dvd which makes the package unnecessarily bulky and is a waste as since I've upgraded to a Blu ray player, why the heck would I want a dvd?  The picture quality is a vast improvement over my previous standard dvd version but the sound quality is extremely noisy with tons of hiss which does distract a lot.  The BD-Live is useless because it really is just a vehicle for the studios to show you trailers of other films and this feature clearly has a lot of potential yet to be exploited.  The silent version of the film is a nice bonus.  Too bad the DTS 2 Channel Mono MA is so hissy during the spoken scenes and is certainly an area to be addressed before the inevitable next release.<br /><br />Still, on the strength of the vastly improved picture quality and the silent film bonus, this is probably the best version of the film that is currently out there.  Don't expect much from the spoken dialogue parts though.
There's really nothing else to say about this film. It's a CLASSIC. But I own an older copy on dvd and I can say that this restoration is nothing short of miraculous. The picture is great. This is really worth having.
This movie is quite good and I have to say the Blu Ray is amazing, I was totally shocked how good this movie looked and sounded (Mono).  For anyone interested in WW1 I would highly recommend this movie.
Chris got it right in his review, but I got a copy to re-re-watch it because the new Dietrich Bonnhoeffer bio suggests that watching the film in NYC was central to his pacifism and perhaps a broader road to Damascus conversion.  He saw it with a French fellow student, and the audience of American kids were cheering for the Germans, almost certainly utter ignorance and programming from all the other war movies, not post-modern irony or subversive humor.<br /><br />You can glimpse, if you try hard enough, what got under the skin of a corporal with Iron Cross, first class, recovering from a gassing when the armistice and Spartacist rising happened, who helped ban the film in then-contemporary Germany, taking it so personally that Remarque (the author) was on a very short enemies list.  Myself, I am wondering if a fox hunting man named Sassoon read the book or saw the film.
.<br />...Rather than repeat all of the excellent reviews... I am going to address just one aspect of this brilliant film... the special effects...<br /><br />...Having been in two wars, I know what real explosions look like.  I know that grenades do not throw men thirty feet into the air... when you throw one into a bamboo hut it does not look like a 55 gallon drum of gasoline was just detonated...<br />Take... say... a 60 mm mortar round... the explosion is mostly explosive and dirt... only the briefest glimpse of flame...<br /><br />...But some hack special effects types started using insane amounts of gasoline... then directors decided that they liked it and forced good special effects men to go for larger and larger amounts of gasoline...<br /><br />...But All Quiet on the Western Front... does not prostitute itself that way.  Many of the special effects crew had been in the trenches and knew exactly what it looked like... If you know what to look for you can spot effects from a French 75 up to a major seige gun... and no gasoline...<br /><br />...The greatest special effect is during the French charge almost to the lip of the German trenches... and the German siege guns (battleship type weapons and larger) lay down a "barrage" (original meaning... barrier) between the trenches and the charging infantry.<br /><br />...While some license is taken... guns that heavy never deliberately targeted within a hundred meters of friendly lines... the effect is staggering... Up to that moment the charging troops are throwing their bodies against metal... chopped down in endless rows by machine guns... torn asunder and made part of the soil by artillery...  But the explosions from the "heavies" between the French and the Germans... are gigantic... they tower over the battlefield like nothing from the hand of man... but rather more like titanic explosions delivered from the sky by iron gods...  Mere flesh... no matter how insanely brave... has to draw the line there...<br /><br />...These days when I see the sloppy special effects work demanded by directors... I want to lock them in a room with a copy of that scene and not let them out until they understand just how much they have been shoving drek on us...<br />.
Viewed: 1/08<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />1/08: All Quiet on the Western Front has now replaced Citizen Kane for being the second most powerfully made picture of all time, right behind the immortal Casablanca. The photography of the shots during All Quiet on the Western Front is unbelievably and visually stunning. Thinking of the scenes, I may consider about discrediting Saving Private Ryan from Best Films list. On the other hand, I truly believe that All Quiet on the Western Front contains nearly every emotion possible, and when I saw the film, I just felt them all. Lewis Ayres (Paul Baumer) and Louis Wolheim (Kat Katczinsky) were excellent, and Lewis Ayres gave one of the best performances ever in screen history. The journey with him was endearing and heartbreaking. How the story behind the film was constructed made me to find All Quiet on the Western Front much more preferable over Grand Illusion. I could understand why the Nazis forced the bonfire of the book All Quiet on the Western Front because of its defeating message that war is useless and trivially pointless. Had the Germans saw the film and took it personal, World War II would have never happened. Sadly, that's not the case. All Quiet on the Western Front carries so much relevance as it does today, and an ounce of it will never be shed off as time wears on. I don't think I can add any more except for the fact that it's just a brilliant, brilliant...absolutely brilliant film. All credit goes to Lewis Milestone.
"All Quiet On The Western Front" is one of the movies I love so much,it shows what war is and how it is. War is hell,there's no winner in death. Old men send young men to die.In the movie,one follows our young star to the end,to death.There's no beauty in war.As last look at are young star, who goes to touch a butterfly,that had landed close by him.A shot finds him and death is his end.Why do men kill each other?
The country is at war and Paul B&auml;umer (Lew Ayres) is in school. His instructor is proud that he is volunteering to protect his country. He and his classmates are off on an adventure. This adventure will challenge the way they look at life and in the process change our life outlook.<br /><br />On the surface this looks like a pacifist or anti war movie. One may think this has something to do with an enemy's view of war. Also there is a tendency pick the film apart because it is not the book.<br /><br />In reality this story is more of a, don't get over zealous movie. At least don't let some one mesmerize you. It even happened in a contemporary film "Private Benjamin" (1980). She was promised the army with the private condos. Again we see the zealous ones in "Starship Troopers" (1997) where the movie shows the romantic side of war.<br /><br />As far as the rating it is ridicules to compare a movie that has to pass censors and only has 130 minutes with the book. Naturally the book is going to be more thorough and descriptive. What we can compare it to is the original movie "Westfront 1918" (1930) directed by George Wilhelm Pabst (1885-1967) and "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1979). Check them all out including the audiocassette of the book.<br /><br />The points are made much clearer in "Westfront 1918" even though is shorter it is the 5 star movie. Especially when we return to the schoolroom to see the teacher inspiring the next generation of students to become soldiers. "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930) however is easier to understand then "West Front". You can spend more time in the message and less on the translation from German. In either film the actual down time (between actions) drove me crazy as I remembered the time that we were not fighting or planning something in Viet Nam was when I got antsy. The 1979 movie is a boring TV type movie with "Johnboy" Richard Thomas, playing the part of Paul Baumer. The only good part is when he got shot.<br /><br />The film was shot in black and white but is still pretty graphic. It deserves to be seen on a big screen. At one point they also sing "Watch on the Rein."<br /><br />"Im Western Nichts Neues" By Remarque: "He fell in October 1918, on a day that was so quiet and still on the whole front, that the army report confined itself to the single sentence: All quiet on the western Front."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099496941">All Quiet on the Western Front</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160413402X">Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)</a>
I have to confess that I'm just stunned after watching All Quiet on the Western Front for the first time. I was expecting a good, perhaps even a great, war film. What I didn't expect was one of the first talkie films in history making such a profound statement about the sheer horror and pointlessness of war, without appearing naive in terms of filmmaking, in the process.<br /><br />I previously thought that no war film could make a greater impact than the D-Day landing scene in Saving Private Ryan. Now I stand corrected. I am confident that many extras were injured while filming the battle scenes for AQOTWF. Apart from all explosions taking place a fair distance away from actors, and a couple of very effective special effects, this film relied on excruciating physical exertion to make it's point. It didn't look choreographed; it looked like a truly brutal free-for-all that could easily have ended tragically for anyone being filmed. Disbelief was easily suspended; I thought I was watching soldiers, not actors. In fact, until I read other reviews afterwards, I suspected that the director had recruited real World War I veterans to star in this film. They were that convincing. You could see it in their eyes, and their faces.<br /><br />Case in point: watch the soldiers pile into the trenches to the point of suffocation, with bayonettes at the end of each rifle. I just can't imagine that scene being filmed safely, and along with some fantastic sound effects this is what made it seem even more real than Saving Private Ryan, where modern audiences were always aware that the only army Stephen Spielberg had at his disposal was comprised of choreographers, stunt men, make-up artists, special effects experts, doctors, and of course, lawyers.<br /><br />Despite a small amount of overacting, the only "silliness" in this film is the montage of exuberant, wild-eyed youths responding to their professor's call to waste their lives. And even then, it only seemed silly because the ludicrous anti-drug film Reefer Madness used a similar technique six years later, to show that pot instantly drives people to insanity. At the time AQOTWF was released, however, this scene probably had a much more serious impact, made even more sobering by the emergence of the Nazis, only a few years later.<br /><br />For such an early film, I was often reminded of Citizen Kane, for all of its attention to detail and inclusion of subtleties. For example, in the beginning, veterans don't even flinch as shells fall around them, while the new recruits immediately descend into hysteria. There was also a surprising degree of sexual innuendo for the day. The story and its impact would have suffered greatly if this had been restricted even further by puritans. In reality, trench soldiers were deprived for months or years, in many ways, and this film demonstrates that fact with authority. Just watch those soldiers make love to the pinup girl on the wall, and feel their loneliness and isolation, despite the camaraderie they shared amongst themselves.<br /><br />I also came away from this with an even greater appreciation for one of my favorite films of all time, Starship Troopers, which clearly borrowed heavily from AQOTWF. As a matter of fact, each film basically tells the same story, with a space age Johnny Rico in ST replacing a Victorian age Paul Baumer in AQOTWF.<br /><br />And although it's not necessary to repeat what so many others have said, I just can't neglect mentioning the unforgettable scene with the German soldier and the dying Allied soldier inside a shell crater. This was one of the most heart-wrenching things I have ever witnessed on film. When I saw the dead soldier's name on his papers, and the photo of his family... my God.... THIS is what a life wasted for the benefit of a handful of powerful people looks like. Suddenly it becomes clear why the Bush Administration prohibited the news media from filming American soldiers who returned home in coffins. After watching the crater scene, I could only ask myself, why did humans ever go to war again after this film was made?<br /><br />Without hesitation I recommend AQOTWF as a magnificent example of what film is capable of accomplishing when it's at its best. Indeed, the only thing that made me feel more grief for the human condition was later learning that AQOTWF is ranked as only the 215th greatest film of all time on the Internet Movie Database, with such vapid classics as Back to the Future (#97), Forrest Gump (#42), and Pulp Fiction (#5) beating it out by a long shot.<br /><br />That's when I realized, once again, why humans still go to war.
I have read the story both in English and in German. It is a classic tale describing the uselessness of warfare from the viewpoint of the soldier who is caught in the middle between two warring nations and/or cultures. He, as does most everyone, wants to be a hero, but what is heroic when you are cold, wet, and hungry. His death came, although the movie doesn't make this clear, after World War I is over. In reply to a dispatch from Berlin asking how things were came the answer: "All (is) quiet on the Western Front." The movie does a fairly good bringing out Remarque's intent. Very similar in theme to "The Red Badge of Courage."
This is a 1930 film production, faithfully based on Eric Marie Remarque's WWI novel by the same title.  Considering the infancy of talkie film making when this was created, it is an absolutely remarkable piece.  Many of the battle scene techniques have been recycled to this day.<br /><br />I read the novel 3 or 4 years ago, and had forgotten that it was told from the German viewpoint (such is the universality of the war experience).  The story is critical of war - though I personally believe that at times it becomes a necessity, when greedy/evil people want to force their will onto other nations.  Still, the film powerfully makes the point regarding comfortable old men fighting armchair battles, while teenagers die in the mud.  The WWI trench warfare battlefields were a particularly grim environment.  I thought this was one area in which the movie, though making a gallant effort, could not convey the reality as well as the book does.<br /><br />Filmed only a decade after WWI, this movie has huge historical value.  Aside from the moral implications, it is a rare glimpse into the homes, hospitals, streets, and battlefields of almost a century ago.<br /><br />A very important historical piece that is worth the time.
There's a reason that Lewis Milestone's All Quiet On the Western Front is still the best remembered of all the many films about the horrors of the First World War despite rarely being revived on television: it really IS a great and often very moving film that plants itself firmly in the memory. While WW1 movies had been gradually moving into darker territory as the silent era came to an end, perhaps only J'Accuse had dealt with the bitter disillusionment so many felt at the time quite so graphically. In that, All Quiet was aided at the time by having its lost generation on the losing side - British, French and American films would deal with the horrors of trench life but would still regard them as a price worth paying for victory. It would not be until the 1960s that futility on both sides would become the cinematic norm.<br /><br />Filmed on a truly epic scale with a striking visual fluidity that was still unusual for an early talkie thanks to Arthur Edeson's pioneering cinematography, after the initial establishing scenes there's no real story, simply a succession of incidents as its group of schoolboy recruits are gradually killed off. As impressive as these incidents are, the film wouldn't be nearly as effective if the characters didn't convince, and the film is anchored by a superb lead performance from Lew Ayres as the idealistic young schoolboy who gradually becomes a shell of his former self, with excellent support from Louis Wolheim as the old soldier who takes him and his friends under his wing. Wisely replacing the flashback structure of Erich Maria Remarque's book with a chronological narrative, rather than introducing the characters as the cynical survivors they become, the film gradually shows their idealism worn away. While the attack and counter-attack sequences are still incredibly vivid, breathtakingly edited and surprisingly violent - in one memorable shot an explosion leaves only a pair of severed hands clinging to barbed wire - the real horror almost seems to be the way the characters adapt to their dehumanising conditions at the front to such an extent that they no longer fit in at home when they do get leave. It becomes impossible to imagine a life after the war so completely have they been consumed by it.<br /><br />Ironically the film's most famous scene is nowhere to be found in the novel. Remarque never describes the final death: his body is simply discovered, appearing to be at peace. Milestone opted for something more explicitly powerful, but not without much trial and error. After at least seven scripted versions had been rejected, another ending of Paul hallucinating of French and German troops marching into the same grave and crying out in anguish before being shot by a sniper had been filmed but satisfied no-one - the studio wanted a happy ending (Milestone jokingly suggested having the Germans win!) while Milestone hated the rushes: it was cinematographer Karl Freund who suggested that the ending should be `as simple as a butterfly.' Hastily shot by Freund with Milestone's own hand standing in for Ayres, the iconic scene would become one of cinema's most enduring moments. Yet perhaps even more moving is the film's closing shot of the boys marching up the line to death, their faces superimposed over their graves as they look back at the camera and the audience without life and without hope. It still packs an incredible emotional punch more than three-quarters of a century later.<br /><br />It's a shame there isn't a documentary to accompany the film on DVD, as the film's history is fascinating (Andrew Kelly's book Filming All Quiet On the Western Front gives an excellent account). Numerous scenes were reshot with different cast members - ZaSu Pitts' scenes as Paul's mother were reshot with Beryl Mercer because Pitts had just had a comedy on release and the studio were afraid audiences would laugh when they saw her - while the film was exhibited in both sound and silent versions. Future directors Fred Zinnemann and Robert Parrish were extras in the film while an uncredited George Cukor was the film's dialogue coach. The film was banned in several countries in Europe before WW2 (New Zealand was the first country to ban it, on the bizarre grounds that it was `not entertainment' and therefore `unsuitable for public exhibition'!) and attacked by McCarthy as Communist propaganda after it when he included the Russian-born Milestone in his list of the 19 most `dangerous' subversives in the film industry.<br /><br />The film's German premiere was disrupted by the Nazis, who even released mice in the theatre and organized several days of riots that successfully got the film banned in Germany to `preserve public order.' Over the subsequent years music was added to some scenes and the film was heavily cut with each reissue, even turned into an anti-Nazi pro-war propaganda film in 1939 by the judicious deletion of certain scenes and the addition of newsreel footage of Nazi rallies and book-burnings. Yet ironically the film's restoration was largely based on the longest surviving print, which had been found in Joseph Goebbels private collection - while he publicly attacked the film, he genuinely admired its artistry. The version here is still missing a few minutes of footage, some of which has been subsequently restored to 35mm prints, but it's still well worth picking up.
Generally I prefer the most recent version of movies for my students, as I feel they can relate more to the action onscreen if they get the sense that it is something current, relevant to modern times.  Black and White movies are a tough sell for the teenagers in my class (as I found out today while airing "Twelve Angry Men"), because they feel as if they're watching some exhibit in a museum, rather than an interpretation of the literature they have just read.  I know there is a more modern version of "All Quiet" starring Richard Thomas (and I actually remember watching it as a high school freshman), but given the choice between the original and the remake, I would opt for this (Lew Ayres) version.<br /><br />It's not that the remake is bad (In fact, it is quiet good);  it's just that the original is a classic, a masterpiece.  The cinematography is excellent.  Many scenes (No Man's Land; Bauer's teacher's recruitment lecture; the raw recruits marching off to the front; the ending) will remain etched into the memory of the viewer.  Just beautifully shot.  Great artistic feel to the movie.<br /><br />The acting is a bit flat by today's standards but that does not draw from the power or impact of the film.  In fact, a nice feature of the film is that all the actors are roughly the age of the characters they play (19-21) so their ordeal is that much more believable.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, this DVD does not contain any bonus features other than a small filmography.  Notwithstanding, this is a great film and definitely worth the money.  If kids can get past the B&W, I think they'd like it too.
It's a shame this American-made film portrayal of a WWI German unit trapped in the vanity of trench warfare didn't have currency in 1930's Germany. It might have made a dent in the German people's hunger for the bellicose rhetoric happily supplied by the young National Socialist movement.<br /><br />Alas, we forget too soon.<br /><br />The acting and cinematography, advanced seventy-seven years ago, seem primitive to the modern eye. Yet the whole production prepares the viewer gradually for the gut-wrenching final scene. A war-weary 'Paul' reaches out from the mire of his entrenched position to pick up a butterfly, the most unlikely provider of color in the flattened landscape of France. Meanwhile, a French sniper draws a bead. After the shot is fired, we see the hand of this most poignant of veterans - returned to the front with just days left on his tour - go limp.<br /><br />This film remains an important paragraph in cinema's long conversation regarding warfare and the craftmanship employed, ineffectively, to ward it off.<br /><br />Somehow, amid the washed-out grays on the screen, humanity and its deep, repeating tragedy, come persuasively to life. And then die.
I saw a 1930 version on VHS, loaned from a public library.  The whole movie is in English, spoken in US style.  German is heard only when the soldiers are singing.  The French women speak French.  Keeping in mind that this movie was made in 1930, I still think it's a good movie.  You might want to watch the more recent productions of it, if you don't want to tune off younger people with low interest in the subject.  For example, in the scene with the French women, you assume and know that they made out, versus Hollywood movies these days, you'll see gratuitous nudity.  This movie has all the elements of a good movie plot.  It is an anti war film.  The movie also plays out more like a play than what you would used to in a movie of current times.
This is a fine adaptation, capturing the loss of innocence of wide-eyed, fasinated school boys going off on a grand journey, who get lost in the horrors of war.  A fine lesson about WWI, it's sad to think that such memories would soon be forced upon a new generation.<br /><br />This is also a fine example about our earlier cinema.  With fewer special effects, great story telling is at a premium.  But for this period, the effects are quite nice.
Every time you see a good war movie, you can rest assured that one aspect or another of it was derived from this film.  It ranks as one of the classics of all time, and is a stunning display of the horrors of war.  The story is told from an interesting aspect--that of World War I Germany.  It tells of a young group of school boys who, through the efforts of their over-zealous teacher and other 'patriots', are persuaded to enlist in the army.  Once the group gets to the field however, they quickly learn that it is nothing like they imagined.<br />The film is very effective in showing that war is not a solution to any problem.  The main character, Paul (played by Lew Ayres) is especially affected, as he watches his fellow classmates fall to the brutality of conflict.  After he spends a night in a hole with a dying Frenchman (whose mortal wound was inflicted by Paul), he begins to realize that soldiers are just pawns, tools in an intense political campaign.<br />One of the most moving aspects of the film is to see the desensitization of Paul, and his subsequent alienation from those at home.  When Paul is sent home because of an injury, he finds no peace, and, in a state of unrest, yearns to return to the front.  He becomes disgusted with his former teacher, as well as a group of men in a bar, who promote the war and give their opinions of it's outcome, all the while talking of the immense 'sacrifices' they are called upon to make to support it.  Paul, who sees their hypocrisy, yearns to be back among his comrades of the war.<br />This movie is a very effective stand against war.  The message it gives is as potent now as it was over 70 years ago.
This is the third film to win the best picture Academy Award, and, despite its age, it holds up remarkably well.  Its message is as relevant and vivid  today as it was 70 years ago.  The final butterfly scene is still one of  the most poignant ever.  The first time I saw it, it left me with my mouth  open even after the film had ended.
This movie is so dated I had trouble sitting through certain parts of it, but the epic battle scene made it worth it. The "war to end all wars" was particularly horrifying in that it became a war of assembly-line production--a race for more troops, more bullets, more guns, more artillery, more destruction and death. Entire armies were raised, trained, and then maneuvered into senseless anhiilation and for what--a few meters of muddy, shell-pocked terrain. This was truly one of the most grotesque and stupid conflicts of all time and this movie captures it. During the major battlescene, there is something automatic, assembly-line like the way the waves of hapless French soldiers move forward over shellholes, into the mouth of a German artillery barrage, then mercilessly cut down by German machine gun fire. Then the trenches are stormed, the German defenders bayoneted in rows, clubbed to death, hand-to-hand combat with trench shovels, fists and gun butts. The Germans flee, regroup, launch their own human wave assault, are shot down in swathes by machine guns, take the trenches back. In the end, the landscape of trenches is filled with dead bodies, destruction and carnage, yet nothing has been achieved, just death and killing. It goes on again, until everybody is finally killed. Truly senseless and without glory--a good solid antiwar movie.
The book is a classic and this 1930 film adaptation is as good as the book but maybe even better, because any film is easier and faster to consume than any book.  I read the book first.  THe book is great but if you are short on time or reading skill then by all means just watch the movie and you will get 98% of the story in 10% of the time.<br /><br />Now about the story:<br /><br />All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), Original black and white film adaptation, of the book by the German writer Erich Remarque.  This is a fictional story about World War One, told from an ordinary German soldier's perspective -- "a worm's eye view of the battlefield."  Notably, in 1930s Nazi Germany, theater goers who watched this film frequently were sacked afterward by Hitler's Brownshirts who were spying on the theater audiences.  All Quiet was later officially banned from viewing by the German Nazi government, and Nazis also targeted this book for their infamous book burnings.  When an infamous historical figure is known to have hated some literature or film, then it is automatically an excellent thing to go read or watch directly and enjoy, it seems to me.<br /><br />The story telling technique has some similarities to M. Night Shyamalan's style of plot development such as seen in The Sixth Sense, and I'll call it "everything comes together."  All Quiet seems to wander aimlessly at first.  The final scene makes the plot clear if you haven't figured it out.<br /><br />Part of what makes certain literature a classic is that there is an abundance of ties to grim reality in the fiction, or in the production of the work, or after its production.  This film for example, demonstrates some of the propaganda techniques that were used by Nazis and the jingoist school faculty on the students at their schools, to motivate them to join the military.<br /><br />This is an American-produced film, and is actually Hollywood's first full-length non-silent film.  Other films had talking by this time also, but not for the full length of the film.  Remarque was attacked by Hitler's German government for writing this story.  Remarque successfully avoided capture and escaped to America, but unfortunately Remarque's sister was caught and murdered by the German government in retaliation for writing this great war novel.
This film still retains much of the power of the story of this miserable trench warfare. Although I am not sure how digital restoration works with this film,<br /><br />I wish it had a little more crispness to some of the sequences. Overall I enjoyed<br /><br />(almost an oxymoron) it immensely and will share it with friends and family<br /><br />for years to come. I consider it a great asset to my historical film library and would recommend it without hesitation. The fact that the main character played by Lew Ayres became a pacifist during WW II is a statement of the impact that it made on his life.
Perhaps the greatest war movie, and certainly the greatest anti-war movie, of all time. Told from the German perspective, it is the harshly realistic account of what life was like in the trenches of WW I. Lew Ayres enlists with the rest of his school class, and one by one they're knocked off until he's the only one left. Just before 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, while sitting in a trench, he sees a butterfly; he reaches out to touch it and is gunned down - all we see is his hand going limp as the movie ends. It's one of the great scenes in screen history.<br /><br />The picture contains many powerful scenes depicting the horrors of war, but perhaps most horrible of all is how dehumanized Ayres becomes, especially in the scene in which he goes home on leave to visit his mother: all his sensibilities have been so shattered that it's like he's visiting another planet. He can hardly recognize the old neighborhood. (The Nazis, not too surprisingly, banned the movie from Germany, though Universal Studios defended the film all the way to the League of Nations.) Definitely worth a watch.
What makes this movie so remarkable is that the story is told through a man as human being and not a soldier. It shows that they wanted to treat the opponents as human to human and not as enemy to enemy.
The video downloaded efficiently enough, but the sound quality was poor, probably due to the age of the movie. As a teacher, I purchased the movie to show to my students, since Blockbuster did not have it. It's an excellent movie, but when you teach in a hut and your air conditioner is loud, it was hard for students to hear at times.
I had gotten the movie for a friend, but watched it before I gave it to him. (Bad, me...) Seriously though, NICE DVD mastering!
another dvd for my collection of academy award movies.<br />It came really quick after ordering it too.<br /><br />very good service
Kudos on the digital restoration. Video is really quite good considering what they were working with. Sound is vastly better (though some scenes still have more hiss than I was expecting). Past VHS or DVD versions of this movie were so flawed visually and audibly that it was difficult to appreciate the film.<br /><br />The enclosed booklet has some interesting tidbits that they somehow managed to dredge up (like the telegraph from Howard Hughes complimenting the director on the film). And including the silent version was an excellent addition. But what about a commentary track? Or a documentary to put the film into perspective with other anti-war films? I'm guessing they blew the budget on the restoration. So it goes.<br /><br />Excellent film... now in a presentation that is very watchable.
As a high school social science teacher, this movie is a great tool to use in the study of WW1 for our sophomores.
I purchased the 1930 B&W version of Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front to use with my History of Modern Europe class. The film was a hit! Students do need to be "prepped" for black and white and the pacing of the film, but they really found it to be marvelous!
This is a movie about WWI, filmed in English - but made prior to WWII's start, and one of the first to win an Academy Award for BEST FILM. Lew Ayers in a wonderful performance. My Great Great Uncle was in WWI, and NEVER spoke about it. After watching this movie - you get a lot of insight into why. People sleeping days in the trenches standing in the rain. What is really good is how it shows the way Germany got the school "kids" into the war. Even though there were promising students, they were meant to feel bad if they did not fight for their "fatherland". It also helps to show how Hitler took what the Kaiser did a couple steps further, and how out of control it got. Also, how propaganda and press can really destroy a country, and create a war.<br />I highly recommend this movie - not really violent, but very educational, interesting and a "piece" of history. "we" in the US know more about WWII, but not WWI:this will help to show both and how destroying war is. perhaps if enough of these older movies which were made with people who REALLY DID gp into the military, peace will become more important. The most important is that other countries see it - not only our allies.
That's not, definitely not, Lew Ayres on the cover of the latest DVD or the previous one. It's Walter Rogers, who played Behm, the reluctant recruit who was blinded and killed early in the movie. Why they didn't use Ayres photo I'll never know, but the Rogers' artwork is nonetheless haunting. Incidentally, Rogers/Behm never wore the steel helmet in the movie.<br /><br />Yes, the remastered DVD is much better quality than the former. What a movie! The end still moves me. Ever notice how much the French sniper, who kills Baumer, looks like Duval, the soldier Baumer killed in the crater? I'll have to take a closer look to determine if it is indeed Raymond Griffith, who played Duval, as the sniper. Looks a lot like him.<br /><br /> I also love Milestone's picture-in-picture -- or whatever you call the technique. For example:Paul's class and the view through the window of all the activity outside. Milestone uses this technique frequently. Same as Citizen Kane in which we see young Kane through the window sledding outside. Is that rear/back projection, mise-en-scene or what? Thanks. And when Paul et al are hunkered down during the bombardment in the shack there's a lot of activity in the trench or street in the rear. And when Paul's mother says goodbye to him, we see her reflection in the dresser mirror as she exits the scene. These are no accidents but a great movie-maker's art.<br /><br />Not so incidentally, Lew Ayres' WWII experience is also a great story. Pacifist (nothing wrong with that) who refused to take arms against fellow man yet served as a corpsman in the South Pacific and was decorated. Also, not so incidentally, medics and corpsman were prized targets of the enemy. Louis B. Mayer and others thought Ayres was a coward. Mr. Ayres was, in my opinion, as great a vet and soldier as Audie Murphy, my father, perhaps your father,grandfather,uncle and so many others who did their duty in the war.<br /><br />Ayres claimed conscientious objector status and asked for medical corps duty but was instead sent to a labor camp and his movie career came to a halt. I think, from all I've read, that yes, indeed, Mr. Ayres was affected by his experience making AQOTWF, but he was also deeply religious and of a philosophical bent.<br /><br />Again, I don't have statistics (I can get them) but Ayres served in one of the most dangerous occupations there was in WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War or any other war, anytime, anywhere: corpsman. Check it out. And his reluctance to bear arms and yet serve his country in combat was and is a remarkable thing.
If you've seen this film on television in its butchered, edited version (when I saw it on television years ago, it was 75 minutes long! The original movie was 130 minutes!), you owe it to yourself to get this restored version that was magnificently restored by the Library of Congress. What I saw on television made no sense whatsoever and was in horrible condition (scratches, clumsy editing, atrocious sound, etc.). After seeing this complete version, I have to put AQOTWF on my top ten list of best films of all time. Director Lewis Milestone made a masterpiece. Everything about this film is first-rate: the camerawork, acting (including Lew Ayres in a role that actors would kill for), script, sets, etc. It's realistic, brutal, raw, and political. It's also poetic, tender, beautiful, and heartbreaking. This is a deeply affecting movie that works brilliantly as a plea for an end to war (something that will never happen, in my opinion) but it also works simply because it is one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever to come out of the USA. If you haven't seen AQOTWF, you haven't seen all the great films. Be sure to get this restored version. The treatment that this film received on television for decades was criminal.
The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A compelling adaptation of Remarque's classic novel, All Quiet on the Western Front offers striking images--including battle scenes that look great today--and a wonderful ending that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the book.
True. The blood and gore of modern war films are absent, but so are the orchestrated scores, the heroes, and with them, the implicit glory of combat. The trench warfare and Maschinengewehr machine guns might be dated (along with the black and white format and by-modern-standards-poor sound), but the nationalist pride and civilian attitudes complicit in warfare are not. A film for every generation.<br /><br />Of note: this format is the only I've seen, so I cannot vouch for any so-called remastering or improvements over earlier releases, only the film itself. That being said, I would consider $10 a fair bargain for a good DVD of a great film.
I probably saw "All Quiet on the Western Front" for the first time in the mid 50's. I was a young boy at the time and saw it as an adventure film. I later saw it several times and, of course, its powerful anti-war atmosphere really struck home during the Vietnam era. I am now in the process of re-reading books and re-watching films from my younger days. The idea is to see the effect they have on me now. Both the book and the movie of "All Quiet on the Western Front" have more than held up. Set aside any prejudices you have against black and white movies. Set aside any prejudices you have against a slightly old-fashioned theatrical style of acting. This is a very powerful film about human beings trapped in the horror of war. What is going on Iraq now is exactly what these young men experienced in WWI.
All Quiet on the Western Front is a masterpiece of cinema. The movie released in 1930 is I think is the greatest movie made in a generation of movies that were making the transition from silent to talkies.<br /><br />Several things make this a movie not to be missed.<br /><br />1.  The movie deals with WWI, and not to many movies portray this epic war, and those that do all fall behind this one.<br /><br />2.  The movie, like the book, show the war from a German point-of-view, which doesn't happen very often.  Typically the victors of the wars write the history, but here we see that the "other side" struggled with some of the same issues as we did.<br /><br />3.  The acting is great, The men in the platoon with Lew Ayers are exceptional and you really see the fear and terror of war in their eyes.<br /><br />4.  The overall message.  Many people define this movie as anti-war and to a large degree it is, but it's more than just anti-war, I think it's a lot like the M*A*S*H series on TV, it's not just anti-war, but a realistic portrayal of war with all the romanticism gone.<br /><br />This movie is not just a movie to watch once, but one to watch over and over.  For the avid movie collector this is a MUST!!<br /><br />The special features are also cool, with Robert Osborne introducing the movie.
Based on the best selling novel of the same title by Erich Maria Remarque, it is based on his personal experience during WWI. But it is a story for all time, all nations and all wars. Just a reminder, that though the U.S. entered the war late, we still lost 120,000 soldiers in the waning months of the war. The film begins with German soldiers marching triumphantly through a German city with dozens of young women running up to hug and kiss the young men. As the camera pans back you see that you are looking through the windows of a university classroom out onto the streets. The older professor lecturing to the all male class begins to talk of patriotism and giving one's life for the Fatherland. Before long, the entire class (except one who reluctantly joins in later) is shouting and singing patriotic slogans and songs. They all march down to enlist thinking among other things that this will be a great way to avoid class for awhile, that this is just a matter of having some fun and picking up where they left off down the road. The first rude awakening is reporting to their quarters and discovering their CO is the postman in their area who has just been called up. Thinking he's there for fun, also, they quickly learn he's as mean and tough as any CO. It goes downhill from there as they go through basic training and are assigned to that earthly version of hell called trench warfare. Long periods of boredom in a bunker followed by intense bursts of violent combat and dealing with the injuries and psychological wounds incurred. The movie is not about WHY they went to war, it is simply showing the incredible horror of war and when it is waged that the lives of those involved are forever changed. It is said that some countries would prohibit the showing of this when they were preparing for war because of the impact it made on people's thinking about war. A classic. WWW.LUSREVIEWS.BLOGSPOT.COM
Young men go to war and face their mortality. They learn that life does not have poetic justice. The film is a study of madness with innovative and original ideas to portray those intense moments that spiral these young men to that madness. Milestone's depiction of the brutality and rawness of war is the blueprint for any great war movie ever made since this awesome film's release. It is a canvas as large as cinema can be, with spectacular editing and at the same time captures the most intimate thoughts of our doomed heroes. The film is a genuine art of images and the images speak volumes!
I loved this movie, especially because it is from a different point of view, the so-called "enemy". Well acted!
The Thin Red Line comes in 2nd, and Saving Private Ryan is 3rd; but AQOTWF is better in many ways. The acting is somewhat stilted in a few scenes (after all the film WAS made in 1930), but overall the acting is superb.  The direction and effects are monumental; the story is as moving and gripping as any modern film.  Unlike most films of this period the soldiers don't do out like light bulbs when shot - they crawl, cry and suffer first.  There is one scene where the troops are moving through a quiet village that suddenly gets bombarded that has to be seen to believed.  It was made in 1930!!!  How did they do that???<br /><br />Saving Private Ryan is a memorial film, while The Thin Red Line is metaphysical essay; neither are anti-war war films as is AQOTWF.  That's one reason why it's the best.  Catch 22 is in the same category, but not in the same league.  Don't get me wrong; RYAN and REDLINE are great films but I saw this film recently on TCM, and I was simply amazed.  I HAD to buy it afterwards.<br /><br />We keep making the same mistakes...
Such a cinematagraphically sophisticated portrayal of the Great War's horrors and heroes.
I was young when I first saw this movie.  I couldn't understand why wars had to happen, why the profesor was encouraging the students to fight for their country.<br /><br />Later, I studied the First World War and understood.  But this movie made me realize that war IS all hell and should be avoided.  But also sometimes they are necessary.<br /><br />I read the book, saw the 1979 remake but still enjoyed the original better.<br /><br />I had this DVD on my wish list for a long time, but nevr received it.  So, I bought it myself.  I have enjoyed watching it twice since it arrived.<br /><br />My younger son is a commissioned officer from ROTC and I was one also.  We both support a strong defense, but hate war.  This movie illustrates how horrible war is.  I recommend it to all.
This is a much better adaptation than the later (70's?) version.  I show it to my Sophomore English class.  <p>It's interesting to cross over our discussion of the novel to the film adaptation, and discuss why the story is re-ordered in the film.<p>It's also interesting to compare to more current war films and discuss differences in film-making.<p>It is my understanding that many of the extras in this film were actual WWI soldiers helping to re-create battle scenes. I feel that many of the best battle scenes ever captured on film were done in this movie. (With very few 'special' effects!)
