...It is scary - Dink and friends are often being chased by T-Rex, who roars like a lion - and yet my son really wants/needs to watch it. The animation is done by the Hanna-Barbera studios of my childhood. The video contains 5 or so stories about Dink and his friends' adventures as little dinosaurs. The stories teach simple lessons about helping others and the dangers of practical jokes. Although, I basically think this video is fine, I would have preferred something less intense. That's not to say my son would prefer that though!
