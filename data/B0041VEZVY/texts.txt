This just isn't fair.  There are certain parameters, guidelines, preconceived notions, or understood rules that any sensible polite filmmaker should adhere to. Psycho stud director Chad Ferrin (Easter Bunny Kill! Kill!) goes on a bareback'n mental rampage by violating both eye sockets and pummeling your ear canal with this disgustingly bizarre nightmare of a film, Someone's Knocking at the Door.  For all you cute kids that enjoyed Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead, I'd think twice before you come walking in this neighborhood.  For all you so-called seasoned gorehounds, go ahead and answer the door but be prepared to mentally grab your ankles.<br /><br />Follow, if you dare, the drug-induced delirium of a group of med students that cross the line of reality and have their equilibrium shattered into tiny little worthless pieces.  They all become targets for a couple of deranged serial rapists/murderers that somehow have returned from the 70's.  Time to party, and it's BYOB (Bring Your Own Blood).<br /><br />WARNING--Being horrificly raped to death is no way to go.<br /><br />Someone's Knocking at the Door is a grindhouse throwback, a surreal headtrip that sets new standards for cinematic psychosis.  It's one brutal, dirty, mind-infesting pathogen transferring sick elements of dark comedy, sex, flesh, blood, gore, super schlong nightmarish profanity insanity deep inside your vulnerable little wacked-out brains.  Be careful.
It's funny cause it's true.<br /><br />When I bought this film there was only two existing reviews, and both of those reviewers had rated it 5 stars and where raving about it. I thought that maybe this might be a modern exploitation gem. A day or so after I had already purchased the feature online I noticed that the 5 star rating that it once had, had suddenly and dramatically dropped sharply. Now there was four reviews about this film, only now these next two reviewers where rating it 1 star and warning people to stay away from it, while calling it a peice of dreck. If only I had waited an extra day or two, then I might of done the smart thing and researched this film a bit further before I committed to buying it. Still, it is pretty funny when you make a mistake of this kind in which there is a lesson to be learned about being too impulsive. Now I found myself stuck waiting for this product to arrive on my doorstep just to see which set of reviewers where going to be right. I guess at the very least, there was still some hope remaining at this point.<br />Well, I'm very sad to report to you, that all that remaining hope had melted away like a glob of icecream in a hot gutter, once the DVD did arrive, and I put it in the tray and pushed play.<br /><br />What I will never understand about modern low budget exploitation movie makers is their complete utter lack of common sense. It just seems so obvious to me that if you want to make an exploitation film that actually works, and you don't have much of a budget or a professional production team backing you up, then you need to keep the story as concise and simple as possible. Some zany screw ball idea about some duel sexed wacky door to door demon with a huge wee wee that rapes MEN in the rear end over a pop song sound track, is only good for pointing your finger at and teasing. Worse still, is the waiting in between these corny assaults. It is then that you are stuck listening to the banter of a pack of unlikable next victim idiots who can't act, and are reading the dialogue of a person who can't write. This film doesn't fallow a blue print for success, it only fallows a blue print to expose every single weakness of its amateur production team.<br /><br />Shades of Evil Dead and The Shining. No shades of glory.<br /><br />Basically you have these young med students who horse play with a bad drug and this evil arcane taped hypnosis session that one of them had found in some corner of the med school warehouse. This taped session is like the translation tapes in Evil Dead that invoke demons when you play it. In this case, a mad doctor seemed to have accidentally conjured up Satan and got two of his patients, ( a man and a women ) possessed in the process. At least I think they where patients of his, they sure looked crazy, but it's hard to tell. My mind body and soul where already checked out of this stink bomb by this point. So now, after this arcane taped session gets played, this door to door silly Satan shows up as a naked chick and starts to make out with one of the unlikable male next victim idiots who can't act, and then like the pretty naked woman in room 239 of The Shining who before your eyes, turns into an old fossil covered in pizza cheese, our silly Satan turns into the male mental patient from the said arcane evil tape session, only now he is sporting a giant rubber willy. So, as the silly Satan attacks and chases people down freshly mopped hallways, the director plays one of his personal favorite pop songs as the back ground soundtrack rather then something that would of been actually menacing to back up the action. That's it in a nut shell, that's the high jinks you will be getting if you buy this DVD. A man raping another man like it is some prison shower scene. It's like falling asleep and waking up a moment later only to find yourself in the pokey.<br /><br />The question is, now that I own this DVD, what do I use if for. I sure as heck won't be watching it again. I suppose if I find a short leg on a piece of furnature in my house, I can use this DVD to prop it up and even it out. Then again, this DVD is so absolutely wretched that maybe I should just break out the saw and get it over with by shorting a leg on something myself. I can always do what I did with the Sick Girl DVD that I wanted to get rid of last year, and stuff it into one of my coworkers stockings at Christmas time. The problem with that idea is, is that I don't know anyone who's been naughty enough all year round to deserve having to sit through this monstrosity. Maybe I will take the title of this DVD to heart, and turn it into a ninja star just in case someone creepy ends up knocking on my door. All I can tell you is that if you want to see a low budget oddity that is actually a good watch, then get a copy of Evil Aliens. And if you want to get a modern grizzly low budget exploitation shocker that doesn't mess around and delivers the goods, then find yourself the South American gem I'll Never Die Alone. If you do anything else in life, stay clear of this loser, it's not worth the price of the disc that it's printed on.<br />This has been a Krakatoa 1883 public service announcement.
I gave this one 2/5 because it does have some original ideas, otherwise I would have given it lower. The movie has a great idea going...it's just not implemented well...or should I say, in a horror fashion. I know a lot of people in reviews like to say "the ideas weren't implemented well" but that's really the only thing I could think. Bulbous, protruding phallus members belonging to homicidal maniacs? Bring it on, I said. Unfortunately, this one has the vulgarity and nudity typical to most of my favorite horror movies, but not enough gore and too many alterations to make the reader try to feel the effects of whatever drugs these kids were on. So, while the film didn't "bring it on," per se, it'll definitely be one I'll be thinking about in the near future...so I'll know what to avoid.
This falls into the "rubber reality" category which I tend to like. "The Machinist", "The Jacket" and "Stay" are amongst my favorite movies, but this outing is terrible. It is one of the ugliest, most stupid, most mean spirited movies I've ever seen. Had it clocked in at one second more than its 78 minute running time I might have ended up sticking knitting needles through my eyes.<br /><br />The story revolves around a close knit group of college students. All but one takes a particular drug used in some infamous psychology experiment that went south. Weird things happen and people start dieing.<br /><br />This is gruesome and depraved. These are some of the most unlikeable people I've ever seen in film. Why would anyone want to watch a movie where only one character is even mildly likable. They are almost all terrible actors as well. The one actor playing Sebastian is the best of the bunch but he's such a disgusting individual I didn't care. And then there's Vernon Wells. He was one of the chief bad guys in "Road Warrior". Now, when he's your "draw" name in a movie, and you can only afford him for two scenes, you know you're in deep kimchi.<br /><br /> Unless you're an extreme masochist I wouldn't bother with this one.
Please, Please listen to me, this movie promises everything and delivers absolutely NOTHING, if you want to be bored to tears and cry because you were tricked into buying this movie by a company that peddles out crap and calls it a movie as I was, then make the same mistake I did. I simply cannot believe how deeply disappointed I was in this ( MOVIE ? ). If i ever see another movie with " a film by Chad Ferrin, you can bet your butt i won't be tricked again, or the words  " Vicious Circle Films. Seriously they advertised " Graphic sex " there was absolutely NOT one scene that was " Graphic Sex " If you want to watch someone with an obvious strap-on that was his mutant penis chase someone down a hallway then ignore my warnings and buy this piece of dreck. The only review i can give this movie is it's a terrible waste of time and money. I'm hard pressed to give it one star. Oh yes Breakingglasspictures.com had it's name on it too, beware the lies and hype, oh wait, there was one or two scenes of full frontal female nudity. I always look for some redeeming value in a movie this one has 0% redeeming value!!!
3 words: Raped to Death<br />Interested yet?<br />4 more words: YOU NEED THIS MOVIE!!!<br /><br />I LOVE it when independent horror filmmakers (In this case Chad Ferrin, director of Easter Bunny Kill Kill, The Ghouls, & Unspeakable; who climbed the Troma ranks) grace us with something that, not only puts Hollywood horror to shame, but kicks it's face in, and urinates in the pulpy cavity where its skull used to be.<br />The director, in an effort to obtain actors said, and I quote, "I wanna make a movie that *fornicates* the facebook generation in the face".<br />And by the love of whatever dark deity you worship he did just that.<br />Creepy villains, excellent acting (Noah Segan & Timothy Muskatell are always a pleasure),<br />brilliant direction & editing, mind-bending audio technique, psychedelic rock'n'lullaby soundtrack,<br />and a set of weapons that will drop your jaw between your knees.<br /><br />If you haven't already starting nailing the "add to cart button", here's the plot.<br />A group of drug-addled sex-smitten med. students come across a pair of serial killers who rape their victims to death<br />with a giant mutant bozak (15 inches long, 4 inches in diameter), and a man-eating bajingo.<br />Serial killers who have traveled from beyond the grave via astral projection due to an experimental drug.<br />Sound up your alley?!<br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY:<br />When opportunity knocks.... bolt the door, & board the windows.<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED:<br />Easter Bunny Kill Kill, The Ghouls, Unspeakable, Bad Biology, Red Velvet, Teeth.
Its funny just beacuase a director puts out a film that everyone in the genre loves (Easter bunny kill kill) then they think all of a sudden the guys a genius and everything he does is gold, I thought easter bunny was ok but it wasnt great, and it sickens me that directors like this get so much praise, i mean this movies about a mutated penis creature that haunts dreams it has no class, you may like this movie if you like penis..? but as a horror fan raised on Vincent price ect id appreciate that if someone is to be praised i dont have to see monster peninses in their films..This is John waters class.
This is the product of someone's own twisted hellish nightmare. It's a collaboration of fear and total anxiety. The premise of the movie is a play on reality; some scenes are shot like a bad acid trip. The plot is intricate, creative, and doesn't disappoint true horror fans. Overall if you're a gore fan and enjoy broader line snuff films than you'll get your rocks off watching this indie soon to be cult horror film.
SOMEONE'S KNOCKING AT THE DOOR, and he's got a battering ram! Dear Lord, this is one crazy movie! A group of med students experiment w/ a mind-altering drug, resulting in a nightmare of rape, murder, and hallucinations. Nothing can possibly prepare you for the purplish, hydrant-sized "murder weapon"! Viewing this film may cause uncontrollable fits of laughter, mixed w/ projectile vomiting! Must be seen at least once before you die...
The opening of the film gets right down to the nitty gritty. It's all about sex, drugs & the problems to follow. Is it a commentary on what could come from these sinful deeds? Hardly. It reminds me of the original "Last House on the Left' & 'I spit on your grave'; with a sense of humor. This movie is a tongue in cheek, 70's style horror movie. Don't take it too seriously or you will miss the joke. I found it funny & gross. I actually got a kick out of it. The plot was over the top & the ending was a twist that truly, I didn't see coming. I love horror, & I love Noah Segan. It was great for me, but if you are too much of a movie snob, you won't like it. It's a great Saturday night drinking beer with your buddies movie. It is not a date movie. Chances are she won't be feeling very amorous afterward.
Holly Mother of Mitra is this a big steaming pile of drug induced excrement or what?<br />How I set through this is beyond me, I just keep thinking it would get better, after all there is plenty of sex and gore and more sex you don't want to see all mixed up in a big sorry pitiful excuse for a movie. Save your time or fast forward to the good parts because this movie sucks.
It's so obvious that someone's trying to make a statement about the use of drugs,that I wondered if the movie was financed by the DEA.<br />Two minutes of alright gore&shock,but that's it.<br />It's something you could show in schools to scare the little kids but it's NOT A GOOD MOVIE.<br />Big regrets I bought this one.
*Knock Knock*<br /><br />I first heard about this movie in Fangoria and it immediately piqued my interest.  One, because Noah Segan is in it and I adore him, and two, because I enjoy sick and twisted low budget films that have lots of blood and gore.<br /><br />Now I will admit, this was a bit over the top and didn't really have a great plot, but I did enjoy every second of this.  It made me laugh and cringe at the same time.<br /><br />SKATD is about a group of college kids, all of whom(except one)take drugs.  They also discuss the story of two serial killers who, back in 1973, raped people to death.  Yes, that sounds insane and it definitely is.<br /><br />Anyway, crazy things start to happen soon after.  Every time there's a knock on a door, one of the kids answers and dies.  Their deaths are always completely f**ked up and strange.<br /><br />The ending is actually pretty entertaining, but if you really think about it, you'll be able to figure out what's really going on.<br /><br />I rated SKATD 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the display of madness and campiness all rolled into one.  That may make me a disturbed person, but I really don't care.  :)
Captivating from the first knock. It's difficult to not be both stimulated and mortified by the raw terror that stalks a group of med students in "Someone's Knocking At The Door." This 70s style horror film creatively takes you through a disturbing drug-induced ordeal that masterfully interlaces sexually charged suspense with a little comedy. Unlike many of today's horror films, this movie features an excellent soundtrack that plays with your emotions. Several scenes still stick with me weeks after watching. This is a refreshingly original film with an ending that will both surprise you and leave you wanting to watch it again.
THERE SEEMS TO BE I LOVE OR HATE THIS MOVIE.PERSONALLY I LIKED IT.
Dont believe the hype.<br />As a person who has always been bored with mainstream entertainment.<br />I've always sought out taboo subjects and titles.<br />THIS is just garbage,plain and simple.<br />A bunch of idiots running around,tryin to make something out of nothing.<br />Kinda reminds me of another wasteful title..."The heart is deceitful above all things".<br />If your really looking for something,"out there",thats actually gonna take you for a ride that you'll probably remember for the rest of your life.<br />I totally recommend: Richard Kern's "The Hardcore Collection",or G.G. Allen's "Hated",DVD.(NOT FOR THE FAINT!)<br />If neither one of these titles satisfy your hunger for the extreme off-beat of things,then try theropy.lol!!!<br />Because your gone....(Too funny)
