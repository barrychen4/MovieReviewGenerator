"Electra Glide In Blue" is easily one of my favourite "unknown" films of the 1970's. This was the first (and only) movie directed by rock producer James William Guercio, and in my book it is a top class effort.<br /><br />Robert Blake ( from TV's "Baretta" ) plays ex-Marine now Arizona motorcycle cop, John Wintergreen, desperate to trade his Harley Davidson Electra Glide police motorbike in for four wheels and join the Stockman Motors detectives division. That opportunity presents itself soon enough, when Wintergreen comes across a gunned down corpse in an dilapidated shack and the puzzle of was it just suicide, or was it murder. Blinded by the supposed granduer of the detective's role, Wintergreen becomes sorely disheartened to find out that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the hill. Exposed to bigotry, hate and injustice, his lofty opinions of his police superiors quickly crumble as he realises the brutal and impersonal nature of their personalities.<br /><br />The talented and versatile cast is what makes "Electra Glide in Blue" really crackle....Billy Green Bush plays Wintergreen's partner "Zipper" Davis...an abusive and arrogant police officer who is ultimately so insecure and lonely. The talented actor Mitchell Ryan plays head of detectives Harve Poole, another bombastic and narcisstic man seething with resentment and insecurities wracking his life. Jeannine Riley is the lonely, heartbroken waitress ?Joelene"....seeking warmth and affection in the arms of the local police officers....and the wonderful character actor, Royal Dano, is the tired and irritable Coroner. Plus, I can't leave out veteran character actor, Elisha Cook Jr., as the half witted desert loner, Willy. In the early 1970's, Guercio had produced several albums for rock group "Chicago" and he cast several band members in minor roles in "Electra Glide"....trumpeter Lee Loughnane is "Pig Man", singer/bassist Peter Cetera plays biker "Bob Zemko", guitarist Terry Kath is "Killer" ( Kath died tragically in Jan. 1978 from a gun accident ) and session musician David "Hawk" Wolinski as the harassed VW minibus driver.<br /><br />Add to this fine cast some spectacular cinematography of the stunning Arizona landscape and a haunting and somewhat foreboding soundtrack...and you have an interesting, thought provoking and powerful film that keep's surprising you right up until the final frames.<br /><br />A worthy addition to your collection of great 1970's films.....
Robert Blake as &quot;Big John&quot; Wintergreen is the important part of this film.<p>Not to say that the motorcycle chase setpiece isn't worth watching.<p>Not that the end of the film isn't ironic and powerful.<p>But Bobby Blake simply *owns* this film.<p>As Arizona motorcycle patrolman John Wintergreen, Blake gives  an excellent portrayal of a man who remains idealisticdespite the cynicism that his job normally engenders.<p>As other reviewers have mentioned, this film forms an almost certainly unintended (and somewhat tenuous, but nonetheless real) stylistic trilogy with &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, examining issues and aspects of the counterculture of the 70s through the lens of America's addiction to gasoline. <p>Of particular ironic (and iconic) interest to myself and other Viet Nam veterans is the scene betwen Big John and the truck driver...<p>And the poignance of the ending is unquestionable, reflecting the cynical view that &quot;No good deed goes unpunished.&quot;<p>((Why was a still from this film displayed with other photos, awards and trophies on Captain Furillo's office wall on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;?))<p>((Incidentally, while director Guercio was, as has been mentioned, horn band Chicago's producer, before that he played bass for Frank Zappa in the Mothers of Invention...))
is the film's best line, rattled off by Robert Blake with dead seriousness.  But did Alan Ladd ever mount a Harley in the Arizona dessert?  Blake does in what is undeniably a lost small classic.  ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was unique for it's time:  it's a police story with a brain, foregoing the more popular chase and gunfight romps that filled the celluloid landscape in the early 1970's.  It also takes place in the AZ dessert, so it's nice seeing some landscape not cluttered in concrete.  Billy Green Bush and Mitchell Ryan give Blake the back-up he deserves and Jeannie Riley almost steals the film with her truth in booze revelation to Ryan (Blake getting dressed to The Marcels "Most Of All" is a close second).  Another gem that needs to get to DVD.
This review is for the blu-ray import.  Movie is 112 minutes, widescreen, no subtitles, only special features are a trailer and a ten minute intro by James Guercio.  Picture quality is excellent except for some occasional sprinkles in the middle.  Great movie, waited for a blu-ray release, and despite the high price I am satisfied with it, at least until something better comes along.  The widescreen hi-def picture really brings out the beauty of the desert in the outdoor vista scenes.  Another scene is in the beginning when John sneaks up on Zipper with his magnum, you can make out the lettering on the gun barrel, try that with VHS tape or a standard DVD.  The colors are vibrant, no apparent fading.  The sound is great, didn't notice any defects.  Love the music, bought the soundtrack separately on CD.  What can I say about this movie except that if you saw this in your youth, it must of made quite an impression for you to try to find it again.  Motorcycles, good and bad cops, hippies, bike chases, great acting by most of the stars, and iconic 70's jazz/rock music that make this a very enjoyable film.  Guercio in his intro talks a little about the making of this movie and what he had to do to keep it under budget.  Maybe in retrospect it was a labor of love for him to put up with all the constraints and to persevere and try to create an important American film (his words).  A very 70's movie touching on the social changes America was going through for better or worse.
Electra Glide in Blue is my favorite of the early-1970s, existential "highway movies." It has a plot, so it's better than Two-Lane Blacktop. Also, it seems less dated than Easy Rider. Electra Glide is a look into America's dark heart that is wrapped inside a murder mystery.<br /><br />Robert Blake plays an Arizona motorcycle cop named John Wintergreen. People mock Wintergreen as "Big John" and "Little Chief" due to his small size. Wintergreen desperately wants to prove himself worthy of moving out of writing traffic tickets and into investigating homicides.<br /><br />Wintergreen's "big chance" comes when he finds a "bum" dead inside a desert shack Everyone else is convinced that the death is a suicide, but Wintergreen knows better. Investigating the murder provides Wintergreen with the chance he craves. The murder mystery, however, is just a subplot. The film's true purpose is examining American culture and values. If Electra Glide sounds like a strange film, it should.<br /><br />The cast is excellent. Before Blake became notorious in the Bonnie Bakley case, he was a first-rate actor. Billy "Green" Bush (as Blake's dumb partner, Zipper) and Mitch Ryan (as the tough homicide cop, Harve) are also excellent. I particularly liked Jeannine Riley (of "Harper Valley PTA"-fame) as Jolene, an angst-filled honky-tonk waitress.<br /><br />There are some "added rewards" for watching Electra Glide. The cinematography is gorgeous; the blue skies and washed-out colors of the American desert make a great backdrop. The 1970s cars, hair, and clothes also catch the viewer's eyes.<br /><br />Viewers who like daring cinema with a hard edge will enjoy Electra Glide in Blue.
This film was released back in 1973, but in 2011, 38 years later it is still sooooo Arizona. Robert Blake nails the role, and director Guercio nails the ending. The cinematography isn't fancy but it definitely works. I generally find it hard to watch older movies because new styles and new technologies have changed film making so much. But this is one oldie that still works. Now, if only Billy Jack had lived in Arizona instead of in New Mexico (Just kidding, this is NOT a Billy Jack movie!)
...desert, but roust hippies, chase women, get drunk, shoot off their guns, and ride their gorgeous Harley ElectraGlides (complete with saddlebags and that special saddle seat). This film has several things going for it: some gorgeous tracking shots of the desert scenery, good noirish dialogue, and two great performances from Robert Blake and Billy Ray Bush.<br /><br />This was a special breed of film: low budget but every penny shows up on the screen, shot on time and on schedule, with B list actors who deliver A-list performances. Similar movies: the Billy Jack series, JOE (starring the late, great Peter Boyle), Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry; and Sam Peckinpah's character study, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.<br /><br />Best scene is a tie: the first is when Robert Blake's character, standing at the bar, watches as the girl approaches him (pure, unadulterated sexual heat)and second is the masterful final shot, slow and lingering which you likely won't forget. If you've never seen it and you like the other movies I've mentioned above, OR if you are too young to recognize any of them, then you should really give it a try.......
The first hour of the film is spot-on, totally worthy of its "minor cult classic" status. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is a bit of a let-down, for various reasons, including a rather preposterous resolution of the crime -and perp (excluding, of course, the oft-discussed final five minutes, which are as good as any in the film).<br /><br />As a murder mystery (which it is only in part) it starts out well,but then doesn't seem to know what to do with itself (unlike, for instance,"Bullit" a film that has an urban setting but an equally fascinating lead performance/character)<br /><br />But Robert Blake's acting is excellent and the cinematography is fully appreciated, especially on wide-screen DVD.
This is a beautifully photographed movie set in Arizona in 1973. The story has a few slow moments , but stay with it. There is an amazing pay-off at the end. The soundtrack features music from the members of Chicago ( who also appear as extras in several scenes). This is an anti-"Easy-Rider" film. Just watch and enjoy!
I loved this film when I first saw it... and still find it marvelous. It is a character study of superb proportions. Each person being fully developed and fascinating. It is also one of the very few films that touch on the fetish of policemen and the uniform they wear, especially in the opening sequence when our short hero John Wintergreen dons his boots, badge and gleaming black and white helmet... and in the character of "Jolene" (played perfectly by Jeannine Riley), who says "John Wintergreen, you were not my first policeman... no way, no way."<br /><br />Part of the reason this film did so poorly in 1973 was the advertising posters and soundtrack record cover, which showed Robert Blake in uniform next to other men clearly a foot taller and the movie quote "Did you know me and Alan Ladd are the same height?", which led many to think this was a comedy. It clearly is not. It is at once a fine murder mystery, action film and, perhaps most importantly, a character study.
I just saw this movie on late-night TV. Here's my take with no references or research. I'm stunned that anyone could love this movie except as pure camp or 70s relic. Stilted acting, odd editing, novice cinematography, simple direction, cheaply made. One star. As a campy b-movie: Three stars. It's almost like a euro art movie, even Fellini-esque, except I don't think that was the intent. Are you reading this review to make a purchase/rent decision or to validate your opinion of the movie? Hmm. If you like "normal" movies and just want a good normal movie to entertain you, then skip this one. Too weird. If you are alone, like "Repo Man", and it's late at night and nothing else is on, then, sure, give it a try. Bizarre and entertaining. Archeological. Baretta as a simpleton. Disagree with any of this? Great. I'm going to sleep now...
The definition of a cult film must be that it is hard to find. And that many of your friends don't know it. Both of those are true here. In fact, there is no current Region 1 release, so I had to purchase it from amazon UK. It was worth the extra work and cost.<br /><br />While the moral ambiguity in this film is timeless, it is in other ways a time capsule piece. A Neo Western that is essentially an anti-Easy Rider. Some of the acting (by the supporting cast) is, how should I say, heavy-handed, but it never approaches camp.<br /><br />For serious fans of the movie, there are still a few frames missing from the end. These were reportedly cut from the U.S. theatrical release in order to get the rating down to a PG. Supposedly the original UK version was more graphic (I'm trying not to spoil anything). But this new release by Optimum, while R2, still does not include the 17 frames either. Presumably they used the US master?<br /><br />In any case it's a great DVD: Beautiful transfer, great soundtrack, and a career performance by Robert Blake.<br /><br />The biggest question of course is why Jim Guercio never directed another film. Unfortunately he doesn't really address this on either the Introduction or in the Director's commentary. The former is very good and full of insight, the latter is more sparse; invariably Mr. Guercio seems uncomfortable talking over the film and down to the viewer, preferring to let his work speak for itself.
Simply outstanding, shame this movie does not get mentioned<br /><br />and is overshadowed by films like "Dirty Harry" or "Die Hard".<br /><br />Robert Blake is simply outstanding as an eager young, moral<br /><br />cop trying to clean up the streets and vermin in a corrupt<br /><br />world. Everyone is corrupt, his partner is publicly<br /><br />abused as is his boss Harvey.<br /><br />Blake plays Weathergreen a young cop who stumbles onto<br /><br />a crime scene. Weathergreen actually does his own detective<br /><br />work and is able to deduct that this isn't your regular<br /><br />crime scene. It looks like a suicide but Weathergreen<br /><br />knows it's a murder. As Weathergreen carries his investigatinn,<br /><br />he sees how his corrupt workers abuse the name of the law:<br /><br />Intimidating witness, having sex with town sluts,<br /><br />planting evidence, etc.<br /><br />Weathergreen eventually solves the murder but a heavy<br /><br />price. This is just a top notch cop movie. The acting<br /><br />is superb on all levels.
I haven't see this DVD release yet, but with MGM releasing this DVD it should be good. Don't expect much, if any, Specials though. I have seen this movie and I believe it is the best thing that Robert Blake ever did. Good preformances all around. Too Violent for small kids. Leonard Maltin gives it a 3 out of 4 Stars. Take a look!
An excellent character study (unfortunately not reasonably priced here) of a good hearted law enforcement officer trying to make good and compassionate choices . Trying to do the right thing . And the people who surround and hinder him in those efforts . Magnificently shot for the screen by Conrad Hall and directed with great skill by a film maker i do not recognize (but i may well have seen other films by him) . Great character development , writing and acting abound . Stream it , if you have the ability , just like i did . I'd never even heard of it .
I saw this movie as a kid and later when it was released on VHS picked up a copy of it. The movie is visually impressive and its style is more like what you would see years later in music videos. Robert Blake is excellent in this quirky yet dark story about a pint sized motorcycle cop whose ambition sees him investigating a murder case. Hippies, pigs, nymphos and detectives with erectile dysfunction are abound.<br /><br />I liked the movie and just remember it as being something different and not what you normally expected at the time.
This movie is very good...Yes there are members of the group CHICAGO in the film..Especially roles played by Peter Cetera and the late Terry Kath. I still have the LP Soundtrack which featured members of Chicago on it. When it first came out I would play the eight track in my car and people would say...Hey is that Chicagos new album? Its still a good movie
I had seen parts of this before, but watched the whole thing through today.  I must say, as great as parts of this film are, it nevertheless disappoints on many crucial levels.  The acting, (while largely cheesy) is enjoyable in a pic like this.  I do enjoy Robert Blake's performance though, even though Detective Harvey is WAAAY over the top!!  (the coroner guy was very good also). I definitely see a link to "Easy Rider", and indeed, both films represent a (then) new wave of modern western, even maybe similar in some ways to Peckinpah's "Wild Bunch" and "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia". Actually, as powerful a film as Easy Rider is, I don't think it's a very good film either. But like Elecra Glide, it does invoke that new "take to the highway" consciousness of the counterculture of the early 70's.  And as in Easy Rider, the cinematography in Electra Glide is fantastic!  The amazing Conrad Hall (the original Outer Limits, and tons of other shows and movies), shows Arizona in all its beautiful glory, this film really looks great!!  And it is such fun to see late guitar great Terry Kath and former bassist Peter Cetera from the group Chicago, after all, this was a James William Guercio film).  But the pacing, acting, story, and editing are, umm...flawed IMO. Mild recommendation.  Great soundtrack, including guitar great Larry Carlton!
The freedom afforded young American directors in the seventies heralded some of the most adventurous and terrific films in the history of cinema.  It also produced alot of self-indulgent claptrap.  Unfortunately, "Electra Glide in Blue" falls more in the latter category than the former.  Director James William Guercio would like to invoke comparisons to John Ford(hence, the Monument Valley locales) and "Easy Rider".  Instead his film seems like a wacky episode of "CHiPs".  I have nothing against a filmmaker who tries to pace his film deliberately.  Guercio's direction, however, feels hamhanded and labored.  Not that he's helped by a script that contains any number of preposterous scenes.  One that comes to my mind is the long one involving a barmaid (Jeannine Riley) who dresses down a detective(Mitchell Ryan) for his inadequacies.  The film is redeemed by some terrific acting by Robert Blake as the highway patrolman who has big dreams that are undermined by his integrity, Billy "Green" Bush as a fellow patrolman who isn't working with a full deck, Elisha Cook as a mentally challenged man, and Royal Dano as the Coroner.  It goes without saying that Conrad Hall offers up terrific camerawork.  Look close for a young Nick Nolte as an extra in the commune scene.
In this overly-ironic age, no one would consider producing such an earnest and moral movie. This was not the case in the early 70s and this film, a directorial debut, shows a little slice of life in 1973 Arizona. The photography is wonderful, making one ache for the wide open spaces of the desert. All of the performances are acceptable and some are most memorable, including those of Robert Blake as the central character and Mitchell Ryan as a bigoted, heartless and useless detective. Take off your 21st century spectacles and enjoy.
Acquitted murderer Robert Blake plays by-the-book hardon of a motorcycle officer who dreams for big status and plain clothes as a detective. Determined and not-so-bright, Blake is perfectly believable as a half-wit over his head.<br />The murder plot is not so interesting, but the soundtrack, scenic shots of the American Southwest and a superb job by Blake make it all worth a look. A must for fans of 70's cinema.
This is one of my husbands favorites.  And not to let him know, I love it too.  You have to watch it to the end, paying special attention to the ending to understand it all, but a great film.
Here's an odd little movie with a languid pace and a very short officer who dreams of becoming a detective until he sees just how corrupt one can become when one has such power.  You get a glimpse into the 1970s system vs. the common man theme here, with a detective and even regular motorcycle cops being unfair to the hippies who are just zipping along  the Arizona highways, for the most part.<br /><br />Tragedies ensue as Robert Blake and his hair-trigger partner try to chase down a criminal. Slo-mo crashes happen. The film ends on the same lonely stretch of highway we see at the start.<br /><br />Interesting look into the recent past.
This one of many many very good u.s. movies in the 70ties. Very well photografed and acted. A classic!<br /><br />A. Pal
All in all it's not a great movie.  I found the plot somewhat convoluted.  The acting is awful at times.  Most of the main characters are people I would not associate with but John Wintergreen (a young Robert Blake) was all right.  He had an overdeveloped sense of fairness, right and wrong that would eventually do him in.  The movie has a quirky personality.  At times it's intentionally funny but some of the great scenes are when it's unintentionally funny.  I liked the background music.  More than a few times it was perfectly suited as background for the associated scene.  The chase scenes were well done, at times overdone.  The raw, seedy side of the Southwest was the perfect backdrop for this movie.  I could almost smell the stale cigarette smoke, beer and urine.  The scenery was at times Kodak perfect.  Twenty-five years ago I really liked the last song - the one that plays over the credits. Today, I find it preachy and very 60's.  I'm surprised the movie has not achieved cult status.
