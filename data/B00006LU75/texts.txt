The DVD contains everything that the editorial review promises but in really poor quality. The DVD disc is a DVD-R that the manufacturer reproduced very cheaply and although the cover says that it is digitally remastered, the quality of the DVD is really quite appalling, being very amateurish and in some parts, simply not watchable. Although the content will make me watch it again, I'm really disappointed that I've had to pay so much for something of such poor quality.
I have been searching for a dvd with all of the Goju Ryu kata on it so that I could learn and practice them and this dvd not only has them all on it but many of them are done by Gogen Yamaguchi himself. I couldn't be more excited about this dvd. It is amazing.
The quality of this DVD is appalling, and virtually unwatchable. Althought I understand that the footage is old, I had no idea that it would be so bad that it makes most amateur videos look like award-winning examples of cinematography!<p>It is difficult to see the kata being performed clearly, and due to the absence of audio in the clips (the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end), the breathing cannot be heard.<p>The video is blurry, dark and visually &quot;noisy&quot;.  The funeral scene at the end is so dark, it is difficult to see anything at all.<p>Don't waste your money
THIS IS A GREAT HISTORICAL ABOUT THE MASTER GOGEN "THE CAT" YAMAGUCHI. IT SHOWS BASICS,KIHON, KATAS- "EVEN THE MOST ADVANCED" NOT LEARNED BY MANY.<br />GOOD QUALITY. GOOD FOR REVIEW, COLLECTION, LEARNING.  FRANKLIN PUELLO- SANDAN
I once as a child saw a documentary showing Gogen Yamaguchi training; as we age, childhood memories tend to make people and events grow in stature, after watching this dvd I now know that Gogen was as good as I ever remembered seeing him when he inspired me to take up karate.
