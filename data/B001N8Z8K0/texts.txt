Not to be confused with 1958's Night of the Blood Beast, Blood of the Beast is a low-budget, independent horror film that dares to be different.  The result, in my opinion, is an artistic mish-mash that proves tedious in its over-pursuit of the avant-garde.  Not content to develop a unifying vision for the whole, director Georg Koszulinski employs different visual techniques as the movie evolves.  I just think he tried too hard, and the resulting lack of consistency diminishes the viewing experience.<br /><br />The 67-minute film opens up with about ten minutes of stock footage from the two World Wars as the narrator brings us up to speed on the Third World War and the devastating impact it had on humanity.  With chemical weapons unleashed by both sides, the resulting draw reduced the globe's human population by a cool three billion souls and left 98% of Earth's surviving males sterile.  In order to propagate the species, scientists turned to cloning and seemed to enjoy remarkable success with their efforts.  Until, that is, the first strands reached the age of nineteen and a little flaw in their genetic code began turning them into, for lack of a better word, zombies.  The film basically centers on two different groups of people.  First, we have a trio of teenagers who were out hiking when the first strand mutation kicked in; they don't understand why a stranger ran up and sank his teeth into one guy's arm until they manage to be rescued by some of their friends.  This whole group of people ends up running for their lives as the night closes in.  On the flip side, we have a father and teenaged daughter holed up in a farmhouse with the Reverend, who has plenty to say on the subject of the unnatural clones and the apocalyptic scenario their creation has now wrought.<br /><br />The story itself, as you can see, is rather pedestrian (with obvious similarities to Night of the Living Dead).  The cinematography, on the other hand, is anything but pedestrian.  Whenever anything actually happens to a character, the viewer's senses are bombarded with constantly fleeting images, including plenty of negatives (as in black and white turned inside out), all of it layered with murky visuals and artificial film defects (such as you would see at the start of old-timey film reels) - needless to say, it's very difficult to actually see whatever is taking place on the screen.  This lasts up until the last fifteen minutes or so of the film.  Those final segments are shot in the style of ye olde silent film, complete with place cards rather than actual dialogue by the actors.  Things really turn artsy-fartsy here, with symbology coming to the forefront.  We see, for example, a number of shots of cows staring at the camera - personally, I have no idea what that meant, but I can only assume it meant something.  I can't help but think Koszulinski must have watched The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari right before filming began, as this final portion of the film seemed quite evocative of early German impressionism.  I, frankly, got tired of it before the end.  The cinematography as a whole just didn't work for me because the director's efforts in this regard seemed too obvious.  Certainly, one must credit Koszulinski for his attempt to present the viewer with something different, but this film just lacks the subtlety to pull the whole thing off.  In other words, it looks and feels at all times like a student film.  Blood of the Beast is this director's first effort, however.  As he further develops his talents and refines his own true vision, Koszulinski has the potential to give us a film that will make him the talk of the town - or, at the very least, the underground.
One of the worst zombie films made. As is so often the case with "no budget" films, the film makers had some good ideas, but not enough money to pull them off. Might be real instructive for aspiring film makers. I did not hate it, but don't predict you won't.
Wow.  Three previous reviews... all 5 stars.  Hmmm.  One reveiwer was in it, and one knows one of the people in it.  Can't blame them for wanting the best, but....<br /><br />  Well, it isn't quite that good.  Now it's no where near as bad as some of the indie zombie flicks that have come out lately, but we have a long way to go before we hit "great" territory.<br /><br />  It's a nice premise, a cautionary tale about cloning and religion and war.  But even allowing for the lack of budget and experience in the cast and crew, there are a few things which really hampered my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />  First, there is more stock footage used here (mostly of war) then in any movie outside of Ed Wood's collection.  The movie is only a little over an hour long, and literally a good quarter of that is stock footage.<br /><br />  Then there are the action scenes.  Especially for the first 2/3's of the film, whenever someone is attacked by one of the zombie/clones, the footage rapidly (and I do mean rapidly) jumps between different shots.  The cuts are so jarring that it is nearly impossible to get a sense of what is happening.  Afterwards, the characters will say something like "Stevie was dragged into the woods!"  Well I'm glad they told me that, because I sure didn't see it.  Maybe it was done because it's very hard to make a fight scene look realistic, and this effect would cover it up.  Or maybe they just thought it looked cool.  I didn't.<br /><br />  Finally, with about 15 minutes left, the movie switches to a silent movie format.  No dialogue, just people occasionally mouthing words while caption cards appear and distorted music plays.  Why?  I don't know.  It's a seemingly random ploy that comes out of nowhere.<br /><br />  But at least this movie ... tries.  Unlike certain other low budget recent releases which I won't name(cough cough "Zombiez" cough "Corpses are Forever" cough).  If it didn't try to be so quirky and arbitrary in it's presentation, I might have gone up as high as 3 1/2 stars.  Give it a look if you like, just don't expect 5 stars.
I saw this movie with the one of the main characters. Sharon Chudnow is amazing. She is my Drama Teacher/Musical Theatre teacher and I've learned so much from her about theatre. This movie was really good. I thouroughly enjoyed watching it.
I was part of the cast and crew of this little gem, and I have never worked so hard or had so much fun as I did working on this movie. If you want to see a truly independent, no-budget film this is it! The reason I worked with Georg and want to work with him again is that I saw what he had done before. And the reason I want to work with him again is because this movie is wonderfully shot and masterfully edited. There is also some fantastic acting. Georg Koszulinski does the festival tour so keep eyes open for his next picture, shot in 16mm.
A remarkable feat.  This is an encredible film done by a truely talented writer/director Georg Koszulinski.  Set in the future, Georg takes a mininalist approach to film making which grabs you by the gut and creates a feeling of horror without the shock and gratuitous violence often associated with such films.<br /><br />If you are a film buff or just curious, Blood of the Beast is one film you should not miss.<br /><br />Warning....do not venture in with the idea that this will be a slick, made to order Hollywood adventure.  Rather, set back, relax and enjoy a great film.  You will be pleasently surprised<br /><br />as I was, and looking forward to Georg's next film.<br /><br />Look for him in the future, Georg  is one that will make an even greater name for himself.  If I am wrong, then let Blood of the Beast be a lasting memory to the Zombie legacy.<br /><br />Great Film! Even Greater Director!
