I like Asian films, don't get me wrong. Nearly all of them, I have, are horror movies, unfortunately. What in the world would possess me to pick up CJ7? Well, someone very dear to me asked me if I had seen it. Seeing as I hadn't, I said no. Then, they went on to tell me what it was about. A movie about a man who desperately struggles to keep his son fed, clothed, and educated despite his struggle to stay employed. When his son asks for a toy that he can't afford, he sets out to find a suitable substitute that's cheaper(i.e. that doesn't cost anything). He returns from the garbage with CJ7, who is no more than a green ball at first. When his son activates this new ball, his son discovers that his new toy is much more than a toy but a magical solution to his family's struggles. Needless to say, I still wasn't sold on it so they went and rented it out. We watched it and, I got to admit, it is one of the best Asian films I've seen in awhile.  I ended up purchasing it for my very own. It is one of the most hilarious, imaginative, and smart films to come out in quite a long time. Definitely one I'd recommend for families to watch.<br /><br />However, be forwarned-parents, there are a few scenes that you might want to see first before letting your kids watch that involve..um, how can we say this...poo. They're not that offensive, mind you. In fact, they are downright funny. Yet, in all fairness, you might want to scope the scenes out before letting them watch. Chow's movies, as you may have seen before with Kung Fu Hustle, are not immediately for everyone.<br /><br />DVD features include: "The Story of CJ7 " - A behind the scenes look at the making of the film, Anatomy of a Scene" - an in-depth look at how a scene with the adorable "CJ7" was shot, "How to Bully a Bully" - A lesson on how to stand your own ground against the school bully, "Make Your Own Giant Lollipop" - A how-to on making your very own lollipop prop,"The Making of CJ7" International Television Special - A more technical behind the scenes look at the making of the film and visual effects, CJ7 Mission Control Game - See how far you can launch "CJ7" into space!, CJ7 Profiles - Learn more about your favorite CJ7 characters!, and Cast and Crew commentary.<br /><br />CJ7 is, literally, the star of the movie. He's Asian's version of ET. Again, I highly recommend this movie to all. It's an endearing tale that families will love for years to come.
i already imported this from hong kong and it is a great transfer, actually looks better than it did at the theater i saw it at.<br /><br />if you like any of stephen chow's other movies (shaolin soccer, kung foo hustle) you will like this one as well. some of the same actors, the same goofy style of acting and over the top theatrics. but this time there is an alien and a nice story. think of a chinese version of E.T. sort of. the part of the little boy in the movie is actually played by a girl and she does a great job.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and at least rent it, it shouldn't be missed (besides its only 87 minutes long). when i went to the theater, there were only 6 other people in there with me. it really deserved better publicity than it got.<br /><br />by far it was the best movie the first 6 months of this year until the summer blockbusters started coming out.
This amusing Chinese import appeals at many levels. Dicky (the boy's name in the subtitles, at least) lives with his widowed father. The father struggles to make ends meet, while sending Dicky to the best school that he can afford, determined that Dicky will have all the chances in life that the father never had. Dicky struggles too. Poverty makes him odd kid out at school, and small size makes him an easy target for the school bullies. Almost everything more than essentials in Dicky's life comes from his father's knack for salvage - including an odd little toy ...<br /><br />It would be easy to say too much about this charming movie's plot, especially if you've seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783232047">*Batteries Not Included</a>. I leave it to you to watch this self-consciously cute story unfold, all the way to the smiles-all-around ending. The movie's style seems heavy handed, by western standards. Acting and character stereotypes come across as blunt instruments, and the "flying warriors" idiom makes an improbable appearance in the schoolyard. A few things might grate on Western sensibilities, too, like what constitutes good parenting - although generally kid safe, a few scenes might not work for very young or very skittish children. If you can take it in its own terms and ignore a bit of saccharine, you'll find some charming fun in this one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
I stumbled across this movie as a pay-per-view rental while looking for something for my family to watch on a Friday night.  My kids were a little put off by the notion of subtitles, but that concern was gone within the first 90 seconds of the movie.  I went into the movie with no preconceptions (never heard of Stephen Chow) and was pleasantly surprised by the movie.  I laughed so hard I cried, and I just plain cried.  It is the little details in this movie that are surprising, funny, and touching.  Just see it, with an open mind.  Your kids have to be at least old enough to read the subtitles, and probably should be a bit older to really get the most out of the movie.  It is NOT primarily about the cute little character, CJ7.  It is more about the relationships between Dicky and his father and classmates, and how they are affected by what happens after CJ7 arrives.  I am here to buy many copies for friends.
This is a fabulous movie for Dad's to watch with their kids.  But make sure you do not buy the version with subtitles. The English version is so much better.<br /><br />  I give it the maximum number of stars.
I just finished watching CJ7 (Blu-ray) And it is just another great Stephen Chow Film. It is what they say ; but the style is something else.  No complaints, only praise. Sound: Louder than you think! Picture: Demo quality! This disc is very good.
I don't normally write reviews, but I was shocked by the few (and I do mean few) negative reviews of this film. It inspired me to write a positive review, if for no other reason than to give this film its worth.<br /><br />I'll say from the start that I am biased. I have seen a number of Stephen Chow's films (including the boring Justic Is My Foot). I am a fan. I find his humor a combination of wit and slapstick. There is a strong level of intelligence and appreciatiation for the absurd (think Looney Tunes).<br /><br />While Stephen Chow is known for his slapstick adult humor, it was less surprising to me that HE had made a childrens' film than to hear that Takashi Miike had made a children's film ("The Great Yokai War"). None the less, I was skeptical. Could Stephen Chow transcend the greatest folly of childrens' films? The greatest folly is, of course, the over-simplifying of the world to a point where it has no relevance in reality, except as a delusional acid trip. Adults of all kinds tend to fall into the chasm of under-estimation. They all think that children can not handle the real world. While I agree that some things are worth waiting to tell a child until she/he has matured, other things, being natural to life and the human condition, should be confronted in a respectful and meaningful fashion. This film does that.<br /><br />This film does not skirt around the consequences of one's actions. This film faces them bold-facedly. *SPOILER* Even though the film has a happy family ending, it does not pretend that jealousy does not happen; that rage does not motivate actions; that death does not exist. The normal kids' emotions are not just explored but dealt with as if Stephen Chow were writing about his kids.<br /><br />This film is a testament to what kids films should be like.<br />I give this film the highest rating!!<br />(also because there are some great acting preformances and some hilarious moments!)
The best, over looked family film EVER. Not only is Cj7 the cutest little thing, but it has a sweet story line with lots of humor for the whole family. My Four year old watches this movie from begining to end several times a week. We love this movie.
Got this very quickly and was impressed with the movie! Loved Kung Fu Hustle so thought I'd give it a try. Great movie for kids and adults!

It might sound unlikely, but "CJ7" is a family picture, directed by Stephen Chow who is probably best known for his two recent comedies "Shaolin Soccer" and "Kung Fu Hustle." Chinese-made "CJ7" is also a comedy, and a very well-made one, but if you expect the same kind of comedy Stephen Chow had done before, you might be disappointed.<br /><br />First, though Stephen Chow plays an important role, his role is a supporting one in "CJ7." "CJ7" follows the story of a boy named Dicky (Xu Jiao), son of Ti (Stephen Chow), a laborer working at a construction site. The work is hard and Ti is not rich (actually, very poor), but the father spends every money he earns to send Dicky to a prestigious elementary school. But Dicky is not very happy as he is picked on by other rich kids at school.<br /><br />One night Ti finds a strange green thing in the junkyard. He brings it home and gives it to his son as a present without knowing a UFO (yes, a big flying saucer) had left the thing behind. But it is a great present for the boy because Dicky finds a new friend in a new "toy" - CJ7 - a tiny puppy-like creature (?) which, it seems, has special powers - or maybe not.<br /><br />It is hard to explain the charms of Stephen Chow's latest film. In "CJ7" a familiar theme of love and friendship (like "E.T." of course) is developed to make a heart-felt comedy through a convincing portrait of a father-and-son / son-and-creature relationship, but the plot also contains slapsticks, spoofs (from "MI2" to Japanese popular manga "Doraemon"), comic fight scenes created by special effects and one toilet joke.<br /><br />You may take the film as satire targeting modern fast-changing society of China, and believe me or not, "CJ7" is also a serious drama (or melodrama) with tearjerking moments. The film will be criticized for its storytelling, which some may call whimsical or even slack, but others may think Chow as director is only making his film subversive, avoiding the pitfalls of comedies and family pictures, especially predictability.<br /><br />[THIS PARAGRAPH HAS MILD SPOILERS] Speaking of subversive, please watch the faces of the supporting actors/actresses closely and you may notice an interesting thing. Xu Jiao, who plays the boy Dicky, is really a girl (she had to have her long hair cut for the role); Han Yong Wua, Dicky's "love interest" is actually a male; and two bullying boys of the school, Johnny and his "bodyguard," are played by Huang Lei and 23-year-old Yao Wen Xue, both females.<br /><br />"CJ7" is less like other over-the-top comedies Stephen Chow did in "Shaolin Soccer" and his films made in the 90s (such as "Forbidden City Cop," a must for any Stephen Chow fans). In his latest film Stephen Chow takes the backseat to flesh out the characters Dicky and "CJ7" in particular and develop their stories. "CJ7" is a nice comedy, funny, and sometimes eccentric and surreal, and it also has a dramatic story driven by the characters you identify with.
CJ7 is an amazing children's movie. It's not a Disney production, so don't expect everyone to be blonde, beautiful, rich and stupid. This movie was produced in China, for a Chinese audience. It presents a culture and principles that are very un-American because it was not produced for Americans. Some of the reviewers of this wonderful film seem to ignore those basic facts.<br /><br />I can't recall many movies that have tugged on so many emotions in such a short span of time - I laughed, I cried, and I walked away from the movie feeling hopeful about tomorrow. This movie is suitable for children of any age - I'm in my 30s and watched it by myself - but as with ANY movie, younger children should watch it with a parent or adult who can explain things to them they might not understand.
An excellent film, very little known, for the whole family and very entertaining. The price is very low and is an ideal opportunity to enjoy this product. I am Spanish and I bought it because I did not find anywhere else. Undoubtedly a +10 on this product
I picked up a copy of this movie from Netflix a couple of months ago for my 3rd grade son thinking it would be something to kill a rainy afternoon with.  Turns out that it is much better than that.  My son loved it so much that I had to get him his own copy.  My wife and I watched it. too, and really enjoyed it.  Besides the story, we enjoyed the look at a different culture from the everyday aspects of going to school and work.<br /><br />The copy of the movie itself is great and was shipped very quickly.
Stephen Chow is a brilliant actor, writer, and movie maker. This is a touching movie that our family watches over and over.<br /><br />I appreciate how he infuses his personal ideals(no stealing, swearing, or fighting) into a beautifully crafted script.<br /><br />There is too much to say about this movie. Buy it!
i'm learning chinese so i thought i'd watch this movie to help me with my pronunciation- about 4 minutes into the movie i was laughing hysterically and went running to get my sister to make her watch it with me too. we both ended up loving the movie, we were laughing and crying through the whole thing, and i didn't even realize until after the movie that the director/writer is the main actor too-- really impressive! if you enjoy family films, chinese films, comedy films, you will love this movie. it is just a good movie. i hate that everyone is comparing it to E.T...it has a similar story line (kid and alien) but E.T. in my opinion was kind of creepy and not a comedy. i don't think they're anything alike.. this movie is more of a feel-good-film with good music, effects, and acting. i highly recommend!
There must be some fairy tale or long time story told in China. I have recently viewed two movies that are so very much the same story, told in very different ways. One, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JRB17Y">The Secret of the Magic Gourd</a>, is told in all the glossiness you would expect from Disney, or a huge film production. And the other is told all gritty and more visceral, this film CJ7.<br /><br />Both films are the story of a young boy who is mistreated at school and misunderstood by the world. He is given this magic thing (in this case it's a little sort of dog like creature from outerspace, in the Magic Gourd - it's a gourd). The magic gives the boy pretty much whatever he wants until he becomes exactly like the children that were abusing him in the first place. The magic wears off and the boy is forced to work for what he wants. Once he's worked hard, he is rewarded with one last major magic thing that makes his life wonderful.<br /><br />Where this film, CJ7, deviates is in the grittiness. Young childern might just want to avoid this, or be warned about some of the events. The boy's father actually dies in a construction site accident - he is pulled down about 5 stories with a welding tank. His body flys to the ground with the thud of the tank. The actual impact is hidden by the big boss in the foreground. There is also a ton of scat humor. At one point the boy goes to the bathroom and tells CJ7 to give him the magic beads. We get to witness the dog grunting and grimmacing to deliver a turd on the boys hand. The boy carries that as a good luck charm duing a test. When he discovers it was just a turd, and he yells at the dog, the dog then machine gun fires little turds all over the boy. He is then hosed down by the janitors in full view of the whole school. There's also some pretty harsh language translated in the subtitles.<br /><br />Is this film any good? Well, it's pretty typical Asian story telling - foreign to westerners, tons of excruciating details and then huge gaps in the story line. It's a process that is very hard to follow for westerners. The little boy can be very cute sometimes. The little alien dog is kind of cute. The CG effects are blended pretty nicely with "real" puppets and humans. So that all works well. At an hour and a half it is about 20 minutes too long.<br /><br />There is a wonderful moral the dad repeats over and over - we may be poor, but we never lie, we never fight, and we never take things that don't belong to us. It's a great message. And that alone is worthwhile.<br /><br />Be careful with younger children with this film. If they can handle the more pshychological terror or drama, wonderful. If they are a bit sensitive, this might be reserved for slightly older children. In theory this is rated PG, although that might be a bit low.<br /><br />Both The Gourd and CJ7 are interesting films. They are an insight into a culture that westerners don't know very well. As such, they are both equally worth watching.
Not many Americans bother to watch foreign language films, but CJ7 is a rare treasure for any age or culture.  It is a clear descendant of ET, with a touch of The Little Rascals and the Dead End Kids thrown in. Director Steven Chow (who also stars) presents a view of life seen mostly from the perspective of his son, a 10 year old. Chow plays a poor but hardworking father who struggles to keep his son in a fancy school somewhere in China.  The boy faces some tough obstacles, not the least of which is his excessive poverty which causes him to wear clothes that are strictly second rate.  His lowly financial status causes him instant conflict with a group of bullies who torment him unmercifully. Through it all he has little more than his father's exhortations to lead the clean and honest life. But the boy does have the support of one of his teachers, a Miss Yuen (Kitty Chang), who is impossibly sweet and breathtaking much along the lines of Miss Crabtree from the Little Rascals of the 1930s. She is there to be his mother surrogate. Life, however, is more demanding than what his father and Miss Yuen can counter. The class bullies plus a totally insensitive and gross male teacher combine to make him miserable.  Enter the world of a Spielberg-type fantasy. The boy's father finds a remnant of a flying saucer that when he presents it to his son, turns out to be a cute and fluffy life force, capable of matter transformation. When the boy and his new alien friend interact, the movie begins to shift from one tone to another. There are several truly funny scenes of anti-gravity machinations that defy logic.  There are several others that demand that the boy face the harsh reality of bullies who want his new friend for themselves.  There are still others that come perilously close to stark death and tragedy that seem out of place in a light comedy. Yet, I see these tonal fluctuations as an integral part of the plot which requires the boy to grow up in a hurry. He must make decisions about how to use his friend, with "use" being the operative word. He must watch his words and promises since words spoken in haste are often a precursor to a crunching reality. And finally, he must recenter himself as to what really counts in his life. The cute and fluffy alien is seen ultimately as no more than a key by which the boy can make some hard choices in a world that promises easy solutions when the only lasting ones are the type that you can fashion yourself out of your inner core. CJ7 is a movie that deftly balances several themes that never manage to go astray. Highly recommended.
okay, the movie is aimed for kids, but I loved it too.  There is a great moral underlying this movie and we forget sometimes that there are a lot of people in this world that are just getting by and are trying to make sure their kids have just enough.  The love of a parent and their kid is so well portrayed in this movie and the lesson learnt by the child sure bought the tears out.  Enough said, rent it, borrow it, buy it - you are sure to have a 87 minutes of laugther, tears and reflective moments.  A very heart warming movie for all ages.  Even the extra material on the making of the movie is worth watching!!<br /><br />this is my first experience of a Stephen Chow movie, and I am sure to see more of his movies now.
The movie is spoken chinese with english sub-titles. A story of a poor family whose father is putting his son thru private school so his son won't struggle in life like he did. The movie covers themes of bullying at school, struggles between kids and parents, and death (kind-of). Very heart warming I highly recommend this movie. Has quite a few funny scenes. This is a very good family movie.
CJ7 worked for my 12 year old boy and for me.  This film is a lot of fun.
First off the negative reviews surrounding this title seem a little unfair.  After reading them, I suspected that this film contained something completely awful.  Such was not the case... though it does deal with themes that are a little mature I wouldn't say that this film is for the entire family and that is it's misconception.  The film is geared more towards adolecents and adults more so than children.  the film is quiky and what you would expect from Chow.  but it's humor is somewhat dark at times.  Either way, should you sit your 8 year old next to you and view the film? I would say it's probably not the best idea.  but it is worth watching for yourself.  CJ7 is quirky and sweet.
Very well presented tale about a poor laborer and his child who'se lives<br />are changed when they encounter a little alien. This movie could have gone both ways but with a experience director that wanted to make this<br />film we end up with a pretty good little movie...good for kids and adults.
This movie was really enjoyable. It's a family kind of movie, but that shouldn't turn you off from watching it if you think that means it won't be as good as Chow's other recent films. His great sense of humor is throughout the movie, and it even has a parody of Kung Fu Hustle in it.<br /><br />It is in Chinese, and I highly recommend you don't watch it dubbed if that's an option. There's a specific gag that would probably be a lot less funny if you aren't listening to the original audio track.
CJ7 is a wonderful little family film from Stephen Chow.  Our family has been long time fans of his work.  This movie was no exception.<br />It is not as violent or action-oriented as his other movies, but still keeps the quirky, silly sense of humor that makes a Stephen Chow movie.<br />It is a darling gem of a family movie.  There are plenty of moments of hilarity, and a few sweet moments, too.<br />Definately worth a watch.
This movie is a riot!  If you like Saolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle then you'll love this movie.  Laughing one minute and crying the next, this movie keeps you watching wondering what could happen next. Yet another masterpiece from Stephen Chow.  XD
I was skeptical at first about purchasing a used video online. But I had searched every pawn shop in town & couldn't find this movie. Service was fast & it doesn't seem to be any scratches Products is really in like new condition. My mom said even though she cant set her DVD to make the audio english she just reads the subtitles & she has still watched it about 10 times.
I'm not sure I could've loved this movie more! Maybe if the ending had more detail but that's my only (super minor) complaint.  ok that and Stephen Chow gets top billing when Xu Jiao (Dicky) is the true star of this movie and SHE is an amazing little actress!
This movie is amazing, i urge anyone to watch it. It arrived relatively fast and was exactly as described! I would totally buy this movie again!
There really isn't much Stephen Chow in 'CJ7', so don't bother watching it for his appearances. Most of the screen time is taken up following a young boy who's poor father (Chow) works very hard to send to a private school. The boy does not fit in with the affluent and aggressive students, and his problems become complicated by the arrival of an alien pet his father finds in the dump.<br /><br />Fans of Chow's films may greatly enjoy the scenes where the young boy dreams of the miraculous things his new pet might accomplish for him at his school. One of these scenes features a hilarious homage to 'Kung Fu Hustle' that was worth the price of the movie for me, but which would be lost on someone unfamiliar with that film.<br /><br />Overall: the plot is painfully predictable, the peril the alien pet is placed in is too intense for very young viewers, the romantic sub-plot is underdeveloped, and there is just too little Stephen Chow. If you are a fan of Chow's films, you will want to see it for completeness. Otherwise, pass.
My family and I loved this movie. The movie is mostly for kids but my husband and I had a great time watching it. Everything about it is hilarious. Stephen Chow is one of my favorite asian actor and director. You won't be disappointed with this one.
It is just what you expected it to be lots of laughs and a decent family movie even educational depending on the age :)
I have been a big Stphen Chow fan, I recently watched the Warrior's Way , which reminded me of his films. IMDB gave CJ7 great reviews, so I purchased the dvd. It's wonderful, we enjoyed it immensely. The service and quality of product are great! Thanks!
The story was not quite what we expected.  It started out slow but DID get more interesting and eventually captivating.
I really liked this film, which can be watched with English subtitles and original Mandarin Chinese or With English language in the audio.  If watching with the audio words in  English, it is actually really good (as many films aren't).<br /><br />Suitable for children and adults, it portrays a boy who is always bullied and how an "alien dog" helps him overcome the bullies--is the dog real?/imaginary?--We never really find out which adds to the magic of the film..
Youngsters will get a real kick out of "CJ7," a delightful sci-fi comedy from China that should satisfy any child's requirements for a wish-fulfillment fantasy.<br /><br />Dicky is a grade school boy who lives in an abandoned, dilapidated and roach-infested building with his father, an uneducated laborer who works construction jobs during the day so he can afford to send his boy to a posh private school, and then scavenges the local dumpsites for throw-away items (worn-out shoes, a busted fan) at night.  Due to his low class upbringing and background, as reflected in his unkempt mien and disheveled appearance, Dicky has become a constant target of bullying and ridicule at school - until, that is, he comes into possession of a mysterious "toy," or possibly an alien from outer space, that gives the lad the ability to perform feats of astonishing physical and mental dexterity, to the great amazement and amusement of his fellow students.  Yet, could this little creature (whom Dicky dubs CJ7, after a similar toy made here on earth) wind up causing the boy more trouble than it saves him in the long run?<br /><br />Although the sci-fi aspects can become a bit cutesy and cheesy at times, the real strength of the film lies in its beautifully observed relationship between a down-on-his-luck father who's doing all he can to instill the values of hard work and honesty into his boy, and a son who'd rather spend his time devising ways to get out of doing his schoolwork so he can spend all his time playing with his new-found friend from outer space.  It's that father/son relationship that keeps the story grounded in reality and that gives plausibility and weight to the more fantastical elements of the tale.  Xu Jiao (who is actually a girl in real life) and Stephen Chow (who also co-wrote and directed the film) are utterly charming, winning and appealing as Dicky and his dad, respectively, and they are matched by a whole host of wonderful supporting players, both of the full-sized and the pint-sized variety.<br /><br />Like all good stories aimed at kids, "CJ7" is just chock-full of rock-solid values like tolerance, acceptance, discipline and hard work, yet it never feels the need to preach or talk down to its audience.  Instead, the values filter their way through a well-told story - which, of course, is as it should be.<br /><br />Sentimental in the best sense of that term - with a hint of "The Kid" here, a touch of "E.T." there - "CJ7" provides near-perfect entertainment for the young, as well as those still young enough to remember what it was like to be young.
I ordered the CJ7 movie for my grandson, and it arrived within 3 or 4 days.  The price was great and the condition was like new.  Thanks again....
Great seller, Shipped and arrived on time as described, doing business was a pleasure and I dont say this just because...I say it because you are a great person to buy from.
Cute little subtitled foreign film that the whole family will get a good laugh and a cry from before the bright ending. A coolie construction worker finds an unusual toy ball at the dump and brings it home to placate his son for not getting him a CJ1 robotic dog. It turns out it is much more than a ball and although all his dreams don't come true, he learns a valuable lesson about getting along with others. The cute little alien should enchant children and adults in this often comical look at a Chinese boys life at a prep school. Good quality DVD with a few extras and fair replayability. If you enjoyed this catch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RNY">Shaolin Soccer</a>.<br /><br />WARNING: You will see lots of cockroaches during one scene and they kill several. I found this funny as it was obviously overly exaggerated as many things in the movie. Some people find killing anything disturbing whether imaginary or not. This movie may be taken literally by some teachers and adults and impair their logical thinking. They may become incoherent in blathering attempts to critique it. Do not watch this movie if you hate comedies, poking fun at the poor, the rich, bullies, large students, and strict teachers.<br /><br />CA Luster
I purchased this with only having seen the trailer.<br /><br />Having seen Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle I had no hesitation in buying this.<br /><br />This movie has the same theme running through like his previous movies someone poor just trying to get by.<br />In this case a father just trying to all he can for his son by sending him to a private school while living in an abandoned building, and scraping by.<br />UFO sightings start to appear in his area, but seem like a hoax.<br />While rummaging through a waste dump looking for shoes or anything useful he finds a strange ball, which he presents his son.<br />The ball turns out to be more than what he expected and will change their life.<br /><br />Do not expect to see as much crazy cgi visuals as in the previous movies, they are there but not nearly as much.<br />This is more of a story about a father and his son, how they love each other, fight over his school work and the father wanting only the best for his son.<br /><br />It has some great moments and well worth purchasing.
This is unlike his other movies but viewing it in the proper context makes it still o.k. After all it is highlighting the misery of poverty and prejudice. Parts of it made me cry but over all it made me laugh. Also its something the entire family can view together.
I rented this first and then HAD to buy it.  It was incredibly hard to find so I was thrilled it was available through Amazon.<br />It's great for pretty much all ages.<br />It's touching and funny and surprising and a great slice of life movie... granted the slice of life is chinese and not wholly familiar, but I don't know of anyone who hasn't loved it and I've watched it with many people multiple times!
While I don't always get to see the wide range of movies thanks to shoddy stores, I've always loved many of the films that come from Asia from the horror of Ringu and Ju-On to animated ones like Millennium Actress or the quirky awesomeness of the Host. So I like to check out films that most otherwise would bypass but I've heard of Stephen Chow and his films "Kung Fu Hustle" and "Shaolin Soccer" but never have actually seen them but when his new film, a family film called "CJ7" was out, I thought I'd check it out. Ultimately what I got was a cute and time-tested idea ruined by some bad script decisions and humor.<br /><br />Ti is a hard-working man with a job at the construction site but he's so poor that he has to work extra hours just to buy an electric fan and good luck finding decent food as well. His son Dicky is enrolled into a school so he can realize his full potential if only it weren't for his ratty clothes and constant picking-on by classmates and even teachers. So when Ti brings home a ball hoping to give the kid a new, impressive toy, Dicky's surprised that it's actually an alien from outer space and the 2 become friends and help deal with their family problems.<br /><br />That last part I have to admit was a little hard to write since it doesn't really do that all that much, or well. Think back to the film this got compared to: Steven Spielberg's utterly classic "E.T" and think how Elliot was so down and friendless that when the titular character shows up, the 2 become inseparable because the idea of friendship and love wasn't being filled in by anything else. The alien CJ7 is basically a punching bag and he becomes more something to be used than something integral and needed to the 2 men. In fact, one could make a case that they didn't even need the alien since they come to grips with problems on their own. I will admit though the alien is kind of adorable and with the head of "Chicken Little" and the body of those things from "Flubber" of all things, he almost steals the show.<br /><br />As far as the comedy is concerned, it's going more for slapstick and heart. Like in most comedies with dancing cats, chipmunks, dogs etc, there's got to be the requisite dance and you know the director of "Kung Fu Hustle" won't end the film without at least putting in some martial arts business. But tonally it feels wrong personally and I'm not saying this is a bad movie by any means since it did have its moments and it's kind of hard not to at least crack a smile or chuckle but the feel of the movie wants to be something affecting and touching yet it feels more like comedy straight through with only some family scenes to put that part in so it's there.<br /><br />I usually don't run into these kind of films a lot but this is a love it/hate it kind of film where some will love it and get it while others didn't like myself. Guess I wanted more heart in this one; I mean look, the alien literally goes #2 on the kid's hand...who doesn't have the common sense to know when he was literally crapped on. Sidenote: 2 reviews of this writing and they're both 5 stars and then there's mine; it's tough being the oddman out.
The version I received was a Taiwanese version dubbed in Mandarin and not in Cantonese. There are commentaries in Cantonese but the movie is dubbed in Mandarin.<br />I like the movie but I wanted it in Cantonese.
I found this to be an entertaining movie but not one of Chow's best. There were many references to Kung Fu Hustle as well as Shaolin Soccer which were funny but overall the story was lacking. It's a fun movie but not the greatest. I'd say rent it.
I previously had taken a Mandarin Chinese class in high school, and was influenced to buy this ASAP. Then, college started and I never had focused to buy this DVD any time sooner. Then, I decided to buy it on Amazon because I doubt I could get it anywhere locally in the stores. The DVD had came in a decent packaging, no sign of scratches and watched it a few times after it came already. I figured the price was decent and was well worth the investment. Thanks.
I appreciate other reviewers here cautioning us as to the content of this movie, and I think that caution should be heeded.  This movie vastly presents itself as a whimsical almost light-hearted morality tale for youngsters, but there are definitely a half a dozen scenes so different as to be glaringly out of place, if not downright unsuitable for young children.  For instance, in one scene the father thinks the boy is lying and begins to whip him with escalating frustration, to the point of being what in this country would definitively be called abuse.  I was so stunned by this scene that I thought for a moment that the movie must have skipped to an "extra features" section.  Then there is the boy stabbing his toy.  The point here is not that children never project their frustration through acting out violently.  The point here is that this movie is so predominantly a child oriented fantasy that this scene of violence is completely out of place.  There are several other scenes that fall into this category.<br /><br />I like some of Steven Chow's other movie's (I'm a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle).  And though there are many things I liked about this film, its construction seems poor compared to his previous work.  These out of place sequences disturb me enough that I am forced to rate this movie much lower than it could possibly have been.
Different from Stephen Chow's other films (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), CJ7 is an alright, fun one and a half hour family friendly experience.<br /><br />It takes some getting used to, however since it's a family film and on top of that, Chow doesn't really play the main character. Plus not a whole lot of kung-fu action...<br /><br />Yeah the CGI effects are cheesy but all in all a light-hearted somewhat touching film. It's not a must-see Stephen Chow film but if you're looking for something to watch when you're bored - CJ7 will suffice.
I like Stephen Chow's work.  Especially Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.  (I have Kung Fu Hustle on DVD, Blu-Ray and UMD.)<br /><br />I pre-ordered this DVD without seeing it first.  I wish I had seen the movie in the theater first.  It is not what I expected.  Yes, it is probably intended to be a "family film."  That's perfectly fine.  However, I cannot imagine sitting down and watching this with any young kids.  Unless of course it's pouring raining outside and they just watched "Bambi" and "Old Yeller" back to back.  That will prepare them for what is to come in this movie.<br /><br />There is some cute stuff in the movie.  But there is also some content that might be difficult or emotional for some kids.<br /><br />The brief homages to Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle and Mission: Impossible II were nice.<br /><br />I never would have bought this DVD if I had seen the movie first.  I will definitely have to watch Stephen Chow's next movie before buying the DVD.<br /><br />You can buy this DVD, but keep tissues nearby while watching.
