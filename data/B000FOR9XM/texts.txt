The Takacs Quartet here performs three famous String quartets:<br /><br />Haydn's "The Bird", Schubert's "Death and the Maiden", and Beethoven's "Razumovsky," in various rooms of Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, Scotland.  The atmosphere is one of intimacy and beauty, and with beautiful lighting and acoustics in these large rooms, very satisfying.<br /><br />Before each Quartet is played, the Takacs' members talk about the composer, and features of the work to be played.  They are all candid and very down to earth in their presentation.  I can tell they really believe the gospel they are preaching, and want the listener to enjoy it just as they do!  You can also tell by watching this DVD that the Takacs Quartet members enjoy working together, and smile a bit as they toss phrases and motifs back and forth from instrument to instrument.<br /><br />As for the performances, everything I hear is excellent.  Contrasts are great, but never overdone.  Allegros always sizzle with excitement, and the climaxes in slow movements are savored until exactly the right moment.  I won't go into movement by movement comparisons, but cannot imagine anyone not being delighted by this disc.<br /><br />Format is widescreen TV, but there are enough close shots, and the picture is good and clear, even on a small 13 inch TV, like mine.<br /><br />The Takacs players all appear so friendly and warm in their interviews and are so committed in their playing, I feel like I'm right there with them.  Delightful.
I love the Takacs Quartet. They are technically brilliant, and have a good understanding of the music. The violist Roger Tapping is my favorite element of this group. He is an outstanding player as are the others, but he really stands out. These are not the cleanest performances, in terms of intonation and ensemble clarity, but satisfying nonetheless.<br /><br />What really irked me was their ridiculous pouffy pirate shirt getup. They are very distracting. It really takes some getting used to. Oh well, I guess we all have an inner pirate. Yarrrr. I hope Mr. Tapping didn't leave the group over their choice of costume.
