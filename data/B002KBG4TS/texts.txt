I saw this documentary by the History Channel mentioned in a story about the Crystal Cathedral, as that is one that is included. I did not know about it,it aired several years ago. I was able to find this used copy, which was in perfect condition.  I had been to see the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, CA and the news about the Crystal Ministry demise and the sale of this magnificent structure was of interest.  It tells about how the design of this building came to be, (to let in the light) and how it was constructed.  There are 4 other Cathedrals (European) on this DVD which are interesting as well, one being St. Peter's in the Vatican.  I enjoyed the DVD and passed it on to a friend.
