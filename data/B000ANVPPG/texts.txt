This odd, mid-period Western may not be at the top of everyone's John Wayne list, but it is worth seeking out for Wayne fans.  Geraldine Page gives an Oscar-winning performance.
they never play this one on the western channel so I bought it.  I recommend it to those of you who are John wayne fans
I have been looking for this DVD for some time and was delighted to find it. The movie follows the book fairly well and is a delight to watch.
I am an avid fan of Louis LaMour's writing, and I was disappointed in this film's inaccuracy to the book.  (What movie has ever followed a book accurately?)  Someone please tell me.  John Wayne plays his part well, and Geraldine Page is OK, but if anything, Ward Bond as Buffalo Baker might have been the most true-to-life performance of the film.<p>As a huge John Wayne fan, I automatically have to rank this movie higher than it probably deserves.  I mean, who does westerns better than the Duke?  Nobody.  It's just too bad the western didn't hang around longer.  I don't suppose it's coincedence that when the Duke died, for all intents and purposes so did the western.  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; are really the only two exceptions.<p>In short, if you're a John Wayne fan, this movie is for you.  If you're not, I really don't think you'd like it.  For the Duke it's worth seeing (hey, isn't any movie with the Duke in it?), but other than him, no.
I have certainly seen much worse Western movies all ready out on DVD. I wish this great one was available on DVD (When I wrote this it wasn't). I caught it on TV this weekend during a John Wayne marathon of movies. The acting, sets, directing, scenery, and music all stand out on this one. Many critics think "The Searchers" is great but although I think it is a wonderfully shot movie I don't think the interaction is as believable as "Hondo". The cast here does a wonderful job of making me believe what is happening and that I'm with them in that time period. John Furrow must have worked hard directing to get such results.<br /><br />The attitude towards Indians is much more appropriate as well. The camera work is excellent. Especially good with wide scenic shots and close-ups of the actors. The directing as I said before is excellent, and the scope of acting in this movie is some of the best I have seen in a John Wayne movie or any Western for that matter. Geraldine Page is great as the Duke's love interest. She does a magnificent job portraying a pioneer woman. Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness, and the rest the cast do a fine job supporting. I hope you get the opportunity to see it. I'm sure you will agree it is a top notch Western and it should be on DVD.<br /><br />As an addendum I want to thank the studio for finally releasing a wonderful quality DVD with several extras. This is a personal favorite and I want to thank those of you nice enough to vote for my review. It is people like you showing an interest in these classics that prompts the studios to do a proper job of restoring the movies and releasing them on DVD.
John Wayne stars as Hondo Lane, a half-Indian message carrier and gunslinger in New Mexico. He first shows up at the ranch of Mrs. Angie Lowe after getting away from Apache attackers. This takes place in the ending days of the "Indian round-up" years, when only a few bands of Apache were left. Hondo takes a liking to Angie and her young son, but soon heads out to deliver the message.<br /><br />In the meantime, the Apache have always been fond of Mrs. Lowe and had a good relationship with her - and the chief takes a personal interest in her son. He tries to convince Angie to choose a new husband from amongst his braves. She insists that her husband will be back soon to stay on the remote ranch with her.<br /><br />Hondo runs into the wayward husband in a bar, only learning his name after punching him out. In an attempt to get the husband back to his wife, Hondo takes the man's horse and says that Mr. Lowe can retrieve it at the ranch. Angry, Lowe pays a guy to go with him after Hondo. Apaches attack and kill the paid bodyguard, and Hondo shoots an Apache to save Lowe's life. Lowe repays Hondo by attempting to shoot him in the back. Hondo is forced to kill him. He takes Lowe's tintype of Lowe's son to bring back to the mom.<br /><br />Along the way, the Apaches find Hondo and are about to torture him to death when the Apache chief recognizes the tintype. Hondo still has to fight - and triumph over - the brother of the Apache he killed. The Apache chief brings Hondo back to Mrs. Lowe, who claims Hondo as her husband in order to get him in away from the Apaches. Hondo tries several times to tell Angie what happened, but each time she doesn't want to hear it. She does end up hearing the truth from someone else, but when Hondo then attempts to tell the boy, Angie refuses to let him do it. She scolds Hondo that his need for the truth is so great that he'd damage the boy's sense of well being and security to achieve it.<br /><br />The movie is a rather complex story, based almost exactly on the story by Louis L'Amour. John Wayne loved the story so much that he specifically hired a favorite script writer to adapt it into a movie for him. It was filmed to be watched in 3D, so there are several scenes with knives poking at the screen and people standing in the foreground. You might think this would make the movie look cheesy, but really you're normally lost in the storyline or the gorgeous landscapes.<br /><br />This movie came out in 1953 and for an era that saw many "slaughter the Indians" movies, it's pretty impressive in its even handedness. Angie likes the Apaches and has been friends with them since childhood. Hondo is a half Indian, and had an Apache wife while he lived with them for 5 years. You get treated to many scenes with Apaches speaking in their native Apache tongue. Hondo makes it pretty clear that the only reason that the Apache are rising up are that the US government has been actively deceiving them and betraying them. He explains that the Apache are very much against lying, and that he is the same way.<br /><br />Compared to many other westerns, this does a reasonably good job of showing shades of grey, not just 'Good' and 'Bad'. The Apaches were pushed into the war, but they're prepared to kill an innocent woman who has lived on this land from birth. The settlers are sometimes obnoxious about their desire to get rid of the "natives". In the end, Hondo says that he imagines this will be the end of the Apache way of life, and that it's a shame.
HONDO is a solid Western in the best tradition of the genre. Based on the story "The Gift of Cochise" by Louis L'Amour, John Wayne brings the character Hondo Lane to the screen juxtaposed with his familiar screen presence yet true to L'Amour's spirit of the literary "Western." James Edward Grant's script is impressively sympathetic to the American Indian given the period when this film was produced. Geraldine Page as Angie is perfectly naïve as the homesteader living alone with her son in the open wilderness of rock and dust (artistically captured by Robert Burks' cinematography). However, it is John Wayne's portrayal as the enigmatically tough yet unemotionally tender survivor of this barren country that is the strength of this film. The music for HONDO is credited to both Emil Newman and Hugo Friedhofer and their impressive melody for HONDO majestically reflects the honorable and brave stature of the man.
I was going to wait until this was available on widescreen until I did some research on the web and found out that this DVD is in the original aspect radio of the film, so this is "as good as it gets".<br /><br />I couldn't find anywhere, where Amazon indicates this.
I supposed to any John Wayne fan, this movie have to be one of his best ever. To an non-John Wayne fan and you haven't seen this movie, you will be very pleasantly surprise. It proves to be a finely crafted film, well directed, scripted and fill with interesting characters. John Farrow directed this film and he did a good job. The movie was based on Louis L'Amour novel and having read the book, I thought the movie did great justice to it.<br /><br />John Wayne played his role well although most people will never believed him to be "half-Indian". His support of Indians' position proves to be quite enlightening considering when this movie was made. Wayne managed to bring out his character with skills which often belied many critics who only believed that Wayne can only be Wayne. Geraldine Page is perfect as Wayne's love interest. She's supposed to be "homely" looking and I supposed she had to "downgrade" her looks to play the part. The movie proves to be well supported by a good cast such as Ward Bond, James Arness and Michael Pate.<br /><br />The movie initially came in 3-D effect and the VHS tape I owned is in that effect. So everytime I played the movie, I have to put on those silly 3D glasses which create some eyestrain after a while. Good thing the movie is only 84 minutes long. The 3D effects isn't that bad but I thought the movie could have gone without it. Some of the scenes were made for the 3D like the knife coming toward you and such things you see when you go and watch Terminator 3D at Universal Studios. Without the 3D, these scenes looked pretty awkward and weak.<br /><br />Despite of that, Hondo Lane would be one of the greatest characters played by Wayne. Its too bad that DVD release on this movie haven't been done yet and if it does come out someday, it should be release in its original 3D format with the 3D glasses enclosed inside the DVD container.<br /><br />Movie come highly recommended for anyone who likes western.
Hondo is a mighty impressive film. It is that rare western that greatly succeeds on on a technical level, as well as an emotional level.<br /><br />John Wayne and co-star Geraldine Page have amazing chemistry, and child actor Lee Aaker is wonderful and believable as the little boy. (unlike the many phony child actors that were common in the 50s)<br /><br />The story closely follows the Louis L'Amour novel it was based on, and that is a big plus. It's a very mature and complex tale that is handled with confidence and grace by a great cast, crew and director.<br /><br />This wonderful film is yet more proof that John Wayne wasn't just an iconic "movie star," but this man was a superb actor in all regards.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
WOW...<br /><br />I can't believe that for $10 ...we get a great version of  a classic John Wayne movie..HONDO!  That isn't all though...a fabulous "Making Of" with some of the main players from the movie and a couple of featurettes on  the screenwriter and Ward Bond...an  incredible package for the money.  I hope this company is going to do all the Wayne re-issues...I believe they did McLintock, High and the Mighty and Island in the Sky...all fabulous transfers and great extras...truly make the movie more enjoyable to  learn about how it came about....<br /><br />PLEASE buy this...if you are a Wayne fan you'll love it and encourage further grade  A treatments of the Dukes movies instead of the crappy transfers with no  extras we are used to ..<br /><br />buy it now ..PILGRIM!
If you've seen "The Searchers," then John Wayne's portrayal of Hondo Lane will remind you in some ways of Ethan Edwards, the angry, "racist" lead character in his later, better-known movie.<br /><br /> But they're different -- "Hondo" gives its own spin on life in the Old West, unlike the latter movie of Wayne's. Ethan Edwards of "The Searchers" is an enraged, hating man; Hondo Lane is calmer, more observant of life in general, given to wise, laconic comments about how to survive as a loner in the West to Geraldine Page's well-meaning but often flighty ranch wife, who is ultimately his love interest in the film.<br /><br /> Ethan Edwards knew the Indians and their ways, and hated them. Hondo Lane knows the Indians and their ways -- he is candid about being part-Indian himself -- and makes no secret of his respect for them. As a result, the Apaches who menace the settlers and fight the Cavalry in "Hondo" are portrayed more sympathetically, and with more nuances, than Edwards' despised Comanches. On the other hand, "Hondo" tends to idealize the Indians as "noble savages" -- Hondo Lane claims in a couple of scenes that the Apaches never lie. In "The Searchers," one might say, the Comanches are at least portrayed as more human and flawed.<br /><br /> Edwards had no pets that we are made aware of -- but Hondo has Sam. That is, Sam consents to travel with him. The fiercely independent, don't-pet-me-or-I'll-bite-you dog, who forages for his own food (I don't need no humans to feed me!), tags along with Hondo, once drowning an Indian who had tried to kill his human friend. The film resists the temptation to have Hondo grieve or sentimentalize when Sam is speared and killed later by another Indian. This seems harsh on first viewing -- but wait. Hondo has made it clear that he is an unsentimental, practical loner who takes care of himself. Sam was the same way. Now Sam is gone, and Hondo doubtless hurt for him in his innermost soul. But we are shown no manifestation of it. Somehow, that's the way it should be in this Western.<br /><br /> The action sequences in "Hondo" are even better than those in the later, longer "The Searchers." Wayne appears to have done a lot of -- but not all of -- his own stunts in "Hondo." But he was three years younger than when he made "The Searchers".<br /><br /> Last but not least there is Ward Bond, playing Hondo's long-time trail pal. Bond portrayed only one part -- if you've seen one movie with him, you've seen all his roles -- but he played it superbly. Also, look for a very young James Arness in a small but key speaking role; a year or two later he would rocket to TV fame as Matt Dillon in "Gunsmoke." Wayne reportedly helped him to land the plum role.<br /><br /> "Hondo" is an exceptional Western which never got the attention it deserved because the same year, Alan Ladd made "Shane." Here's your chance to see it for the first time, 56 years after it was made. It's well worth it.
wayne is in fine form as hondo lane, rider and sometime scout for the army. hondo's best friend is a dog(used here to good effect and again in big jake) as the stiry opens hondo is running from the apaches and has lost his horse.as he walks in the desert he finds a farm with a boy and his mother(geraldine page who got an oscar nod on this her first movie)and stays for a little while.he also begins too fall for her,and when he leaves he doesn't want to leave. soon he runs into the womans no good runaway husband and in a fight kills him. now it's up to hondo to protect the woman and her son from the apaches.<br /><br />  at 84 mins this is one great movie that i wish had lasted even longer. wayne and page have great on screen sparks and the action is first rate. not to be missed.
HONDO.<br /><br />One of the better John Wayne westerns according to "LIFE AND TIMES OF THE WESTERN MOVIE" (and myself) is now available in DVD format. This Batjac production had been a collector's dream for a long time. Years ago I bought a VHS tape that did not satisfy me, but this DVD has got all it takes.<br /><br />In Hondo, John Wayne plays a cavalry dispatch rider who helps a lonely woman (Geraldine Chaplin) and her son (Lee Aaker) through an Indian uprising. Not a run-of-the-mill, cowboy versus Indians, this western shows a sympathetic view towards the Apaches who are gradually losing their way of life as the white men settle in the Southwest.<br /><br />Wayne's character, Hondo, who is part Indian is caught in a crossfire when he has to defend the woman and her small boy in a conflict between Victorio's Apaches and the Cavalry.<br /><br />Hondo is based on a novel by Louis Lamour and written by James Edward Grant. Director John Farrow had to quit his directorial assignment due to another engagement, so John Ford finished the movie unaccredited.<br /><br />This DVD is loaded with extras, such as interviews, trailers, commentaries, the making of Hondo in the Camargo, Mexico, desert. In one of the extras John Wayne's son explains how they cleaned each frame of the movie prior to transferring it to DVD.<br /><br />Watching it you will get to know some facets of John Wayne's personality that better explain why he stayed in the saddle so long and how he could fill the silver screen the way he did.
Hondo stars John Wayne as the cavalry scout Hondo Lane, a halfbreed who comes upon a woman and her child in the desert alone at their homestead.  Another great role for John Wayne as the tough scout who steps in as a father figure for the young boy, Johnny, and also as a sort of husband for Angie Lowe, whose husband is off gambling.  Very good movie with beautiful scenery throughout.  Starring Geraldine Page, Ward Bond, and in an early role, James Arness.  Almost identical to the novel with whole scenes identical to the dialogue in the Louis L'Amour western.  Check out the Ralph Taeger short-lived TV show as well as the L'Amour western.  A must-have for John Wayne fans.  Too bad it has not been released on DVD yet.
Hondo: The movie is my personal favorite western of all time, out of my personal western movie collection of over 550 titles, Hondo stands above most of them and it can be compared to other &quot;classic&quot; westerns  like: Stagecoach, Fort Apache, Rio Grande, The Searchers, Winchester '73,  but to name just a few of many. I first saw Hondo when H.B.O. played it  about 20 years ago, I fell in love with that movie, I watched it over and  over again; you just can't get enough. Hondo is supposed to be a solo type  character, a loaner, it is easy to appreciate the morals that Hondo  teaches, and the lessons learned. This is an excellent choice for a night's  entertainment, give it a chance, you cannot go wrong; it will be worth your  while!
"Hondo" opens on some of the aspects of George Stevens' "Shane," with the arrival of a lone figure, a U.S. cavalry dispatch rider, Hondo Lane (John Wayne) and his dog (Sam) to an isolated ranch in Apache Territory...<br /><br />Lane is received by a young courageous frontier woman Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her 6-years old son Johnny (Lee Aaker). Angie tries to convince Hondo that she is not alone, that she lives with a husband, and that she is not worried about apache uprisings, because there is a peace treaty, and the apaches will not "bother" her at all...<br /><br />During his 24 hours stay, Lane knows that Annie is an abandoned woman, and after kissing her, he learned much more...<br /><br />Lane leaves the place, but after finding out that the Indians are killing and destroying all around the land, decides to return for the young woman and her boy...<br /><br />Under the lead of a stylistic director, "Hondo" may be very likely the finest Wayne psychological Western not directed by John Ford... With long tracking shots and interesting camera angles, "Hondo" is far better in the way of capturing the abrasive solitary man manifested in "Red River." There is nothing really surprising about Wayne's part, but I think it does stress something that's a real Wayne attribute, and that is his honesty and straight forwardness...<br /><br />With a kind of short, curly, blonde hair, Geraldine Page is excellent in her Oscar-Nominated debut, specially in the scene of her confession to Lane about her late husband: 'He was a liar, a thief, a coward and a drunker... He only married me to get the ranch.'<br /><br />Shot on a hot, dusty, foreign location (Camargo, Chihuahua, Mexico) in color and in 3-D, John Farrow's "Hondo" is one of the early pleasant looking Western that I saw with my father a long, long time ago...
This is one of my most disappointing blu-ray purchases ever. As you can readily see from multiple sources, this film was shot 1.37:1, or "full frame" in 1953. It should NEVER be shown in 1.78:1 widescreen as it is on this blu-ray, because that requires cropping material from the top and/or bottom of the image (as you can readily see from the bonus materials, which were shot years ago and contain footage in the correct aspect ratio). It also means the image is magnified and exhibits huge amounts of film grain that result in a very soft image in many shots. Frankly, it's hard for a film instructor to believe a major studio would violate a film in this way. If you don't want to see the top of John Wayne's hat or people's legs everytime you're supposed to, go ahead and buy this blu-ray. Otherwise, seek out the excellent previous DVD release. The bonus features are the same and the image is all there.
HONDO is less well known that it should be. It is a good western starring the leading light of the genre, John Wayne.<br /><br />Wayne plays the part of Hondo Lane who is first seen carrying dispatches for the cavalry in Arizona. His horse has been shot out from under him by Apaches and he wanders into a farmstead inhabited a woman and her young son. She is justifiably worried about the strange man and tries to maintain the fiction that her husband will be back at any time. Hondo sees through this but his direct, forthright and honest character makes an impression on her. It out that her husband has been gone for quite a while and she has no idea if or when he will return.<br /><br />After Wayne leaves, the woman, played by Geraldine Page, is visited by the Apache leader Victorio. He is impressed by the bravery of her young son and has no personal animosity against the woman but warns her that she cannot stay without a husband to care for her and the son. He tries to set her up with some of his warriors but she manages to resist for a little while. Still, he warns her that her husband must return soon or she will be provided with a new husband.<br /><br />Wayne, in the meantime, delivers his dispatches and the news is grim. The Apache are ready to rise. He gives the warning and then has a few run-ins with Page's absentee husband. They do not get along. Eventually, it is up to Wayne to save the day for the cavalry, the homesteader, Arizona and goodness and decency. It's a bit pat but it is fun.<br /><br />The Indians are treated respectfully in this western. Along with Wayne himself, they are portrayed as the only completely honest people in the film. It is fun and exciting and well done.
HONDO is a classic Western. John Wayne is perfect as Hondo, a man who says just what he means. There really seem to be no truly good or bad main characters in this movie. It's about how they just existed in the West. The photography and music are excellent.
Hondo is one of the best of the &quot;new&quot; westerns of the 1950's. Written by Louis L'amour, Hondo- the book - was called by John Wayne &quot;the best western story I've ever read.&quot; I disagree with the reviewers who believe this is a &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;formula&quot; western. The fact that Hondo had killed the heroine's husband (and felt great trepidation over it) ;alone sets the movie apart.<br />Some ironies in Hondo are: a disguised &quot;Lassie&quot; playing &quot;Dog&quot; (&quot;Lassie&quot; is also in  Wayne's movie &quot;Big Jake)&quot;; Lee Akers (of &quot;Rin-Tin-Tin&quot; fame) playing the little boy.Great film!
Where is the DVD release ? I'm not aware if this was originally filmed in widescreen; (1953) the VHS version is not presented in it.  Although, a beautiful DVD transfer is hopefully on the way to a great film.
Originally shot in 3D! Why is there no 3D Blu-ray release? Certainly this film stands tall (like the star himself) when compared to many of the 3D Blu-ray releases available today. It is such a lost opportunity and a real shame that yet another new generation will be denied this 3D classic as it was meant to be seen.
...that this movie, one of the best western the Duke ever made, is not planed as 3D-Blu-ray release although it was restored beautifully to 3D by the estate of John Wayne<br />as shown on rare occasions.Hopefully Paramount and the estate of John Wayne will reconsider their decision. Then I will gladly add a fifth star to my rating.
I know some of the purest hate the Blu-Ray release because of it being released in Widescreen, and I do understand their point of view. I do feel they should have released both versions Blu-Ray certainly has the room for it and I am sure they already had a usable print of the film they could have used so I don't understand the decision not to include both. However, I already own the DVD of this great movie and I found the Blu-Ray to be well worth the purchase the picture in comparison to the DVD in my opinion it looks amazing, and I thought the DVD already looked pretty good. Again for me the upgrade in picture and sound on Blu-Ray was well worth it to me. I know some of the picture is missing and for some they can't get past that, but with this being the 1:85 ratio I didn't really notice. To me I really notice the picture loss the most going from a movie shot with an aspect ratio of 2:35 being shown in Pan n Scan and it would drive me crazy and bug me so I do get it. And if I did a side by comparison with 2 screens running each version yes I could probably tell the difference, but for me with Hondo I honestly couldn't tell what I was missing so for me it didn't distract or take away the enjoyment of the movie.  I know some folks disagree, but this is just my opinion and 2cents:) For me Hondo rates a 5 star for not only being a great movie, but for also a great Blu-Ray release. Bob<br /><br />"I stand corrected I just read several reviews and one by Gretchen Wayne clearly states Hondo was originally shot in 1:85." This explains why I didn't notice any loss of information, and I still disagree with those who think the picture looks crowded, blurred and out of focus due to quote stretching. I think the picture and the sound look amazing a clear upgrade from the DVD. Yes, it's not perfect, but for a movie shot in the 50's it looks really good! It still amazes me how they can take a movie as old as Hondo and restore it to the point of looking almost as good or better than when it was originally released. I know my opinion is just one of many, but it's mine nevertheless and maybe it will help someone with their purchasing decision. Bob
Apache war drums sound an ominous warning for an insolated female rancher and her young son in this exciting and memorable JOHN WAYNE (1907-1979) classic . Wayne plays Hondo Lane , a cavalry rider who becomes the designated protector of  the strong -willed Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page 1924-1987) as well as a father figure to her boy , Johnny (Lee Aaker 1943- ). Angie , determinedly awaiting the return of her brutish husband ( Leo Gordon 1922-2000 ), refuses to leav their homestead despite growning danger from nearby warring Native American Tribes .And she finds herself growing more and more entrahralled with stranger , Hondo -a man hardened by experience but still capable of sympathy , kinderness and love . Ward Bond  (1903-1960) , Michael Pate (1920- ) , James Arness (1923- ), and Rodolfo Acosta (1920-1974) . Not of the best movies with John Wayne , but worth to watch . BATJAC and Michael Wayne (1934-2003) The Dukes son made a superb remastring and transfer in High Quality pictures .
The release of this spare but satisfying western was a long time coming and worth the wait. A strong performance by Wayne and the leading lady as well as the chap who played the Apache chief. Good story by Louis Lamour who knows something about westerns. Some special effects for the original 3D that aren't so special otherwise. But a tight film that doesn't overstay it's welcome. Saw this as a kid in it's original run, though not in 3D. Impresses me just as much now as it did then.
At first glance, John Wayne's 1953 western, "Hondo", bears a remarkable similarity to another 1953 release, George Stevens' classic, "Shane". Both films open with an iconic stranger appearing out of the wilderness, spotted first by a young, impressionable boy. Both title characters arrive at homesteads in need of an 'extra pair of hands', and form unspoken bonds with the women of the households. Both Hondo and Shane have survival skills the families desperately need, even as the families fill a void in their own lives. But while Stevens' film<br />moves at a slow, deliberate pace, meticulously creating a near-mythic vision, "Hondo" director John Farrow, working from a script by longtime Wayne scribe James Edward Grant (from Louis L'Amour story), cuts the exposition down to basics, giving the film a much leaner 'look', with a climax (actually directed by John Ford, as Farrow had scheduling problems with another film) that is so fast-paced that it can leave a viewer in 'midair', expecting more. As a result, "Hondo" isn't held in as high esteem as "Shane", but is certainly a rewarding, entertaining experience, with one of Wayne's best pre-"Searchers" performances, and Geraldine Page earning an Oscar nomination in her film debut.<br /><br />Filmed in the broiling summer heat of Mexico, utilizing massive,<br />cumbersome dual cameras to create 3-D (which both Wayne and Warner studio head Jack Warner felt was the wave of the future, but would be pass&eacute; by the film's release), the production was grueling, yet formed lasting friendships. Australian Michael Pate, playing the key role of historic Chiricahua Apache Chief, Vittorio, was stunned to find Wayne, during a dangerous riding sequence, running along, off-camera, to protect him if he fell (Wayne, impressed by the actor, would cast him, ten years later, as another Indian chief in "McLintock!"). Several of Wayne's 'Stock Company' (Ward Bond, Paul Fix, James Arness, and Chuck Roberson) have roles (Bond's bearded, crusty 'Buffalo Baker' is a standout). John Ford, between films, vacationed in Mexico to visit Wayne and Bond, and was recruited (unbilled), to help direct.<br /><br />The only discordant note on the set was stage actress Page. Wayne had hoped to get Katharine Hepburn for the role of Angie Lowe, but the liberal actress wasn't comfortable working with the politically conservative Wayne at that time (during the "Witch Hunt" for suspected Communists in the film industry), and passed on the project (as would her long-time love, Spencer Tracy, in "The High and the Mighty", Wayne's next production).<br />It would be 22 years before Hepburn and Wayne would finally team up together (in "Rooster Cogburn"). Geraldine Page, picked by Farrow for her fresh, 'natural' look, carried her stage training and 'attitude' into the filming, which did little to endear her to the cast, and Wayne felt little chemistry between them (although her performance would be the most honored, by the film industry).<br /><br />With colorful characterizations, a chaste romance, plenty of action, and little of the obvious '3-D' gimmicks (only noticeable in the titles sequence, and two Indian fight scenes), "Hondo" was a HUGE hit when released, and has endured as one of John Wayne's most popular westerns.<br /><br />Best of the Special Edition DVD 'extras' is a wonderful "Making of" documentary, with comments by Pate and the film's juvenile lead, Lee Aaker; brief bios of writer Grant, and Ward Bond; and a revealing, VERY balanced Apache overview of both the film and the REAL Chiricahua Chief Vittorio.<br /><br />With nearly pristine image and sound quality, the "Special Edition" certainly lives up to expectations!
This is a great western film, fast-paced and enjoyable throughout.  I've watched it a few times, and what really impresses me is that the entire cast actually seem to be enjoying what they are doing.  This transfers to the audience.  This is one of Wayne's best performances and I believe his line at the end where he calls for the wagon train to move out became a favorite of impersonators (something like &quot;wagon, ho!&quot;).  Along with &quot;Shane&quot;, this is one of my favorite westerns, and the plots are similar.  However, these are two very different films.  &quot;Shane&quot; is a sweeping epic of values and moral dilemmas, beautifully filmed and acted, patiently paced.  &quot;Hondo&quot; is shorter, faster, and simply put, a lot of fun.
This is an overlooked John Wayne movie. Because of the unusual 3-D format, many people seem to forget this one. Wayne is at his best as the tough/tender Hondo Lane. I would recommend this to all John Wayne fans.
Yes, The Movie itself is a great work but the picture quality from this Blu Ray Version shows almost no difference from that of DVD. Personally disappointed in this point very much. it doesn't seem to have the remastered process for this blu ray. So<br />Personally <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006YZOXDK">Hondo [Blu-ray</a>]I think it's not necessary to buy this blu ray version expecting better picture quality if you already have the dvd of this movie.
This movie was much better than I expected, in that it has some real human beings dealing with some genuinely touching issues, mainly about honesty.  Hondo is primarily a character study, focusing on John Wayne, Geraldine Page, and an Apache war chief, and their bizarre triangle of friendship and honor during the Indian wars.  Hondo is one of the Duke's most macho roles - he's tougher and more unbending than I've ever seen him before.  Countering this is Page's terrible performance in a typically sexist role for a 1950's western ("A woman should know how to cook," booms the Duke like a commandment).  As their love grows, they argue about honesty... Wayne in typical Duke-ish fashion refuses to tell even a white lie.  Yet, in the end, 3 lies are told, one to save Wayne's life, one to save their love, and another to prevent Page's son from growing up with the true knowledge of his scoundrel father (which we today know is a bad idea).  Still, Hondo's unbending honesty also saves their lives from the Apaches, so we are left with a well-rounded, *adult* view of honesty that still holds its relevance today.  <p>I'm not sure why people complain about "realism" in these old movies - the Duke shoes his own horses right on film, no detail missed, as if he'd been doing it for years.  You'd never see that from an actor today!  The Apache indians are all played by Apache indians (including the leading roles) and their characters are all faithful to history.  Perhaps our modern "notion" of realism has changed.  The film has that washed-out nostalgic look in its coloring, but that was due to the technology of the time.  Of course, bad actors from the 1950's all seem to perform with the same annoying pace and vocal style, but I'm sure our modern equivallents will become apparent in 50 years, too.  A fine Wayne film.
HONDO is an excellent western, featuring terrific performances by Wayne and Geraldine Page. The VHS release in welcome, but the film is compromised a bit here since it is robbed of the original stereoscopic 3-D presentation. It is one of the better 3-D movies (in fact, the only one to win an Oscar (G.Page). <p>Don't confuse the awful red/blue 3-D TV showings in the early 90's with the original polarized (clear glasses) 3-D...it isn't the same thing at all and the TV version looked nothing like the original 3-D did.<p>Try to catch this one at a 3-D revival sometime, to experience the movie as intended.
Perhaps the best John Wayne vehicle not directed by John Ford or Howard Hawks, "Hondo" (1953) gives the Duke one his most complex portrayals in this admirably low-key Western. Taut direction from John Farrow (the high-water mark of his career), with an auspicious screen debut for Oscar-nominated Geraldine Page. Veteran cinematographers Robert Burks and Archie Stout strikingly capture the Camargo, Mexico landscape. Originally shown in 3-D, "Hondo" deserves a theatrical reissue for a new generation of moviegoers.
Although not historically or tactically accurate a great enterprising movie. The DVD special features make it worth collecting. A fine example of 3D even though it never caught on. (kinda like Blu-Ray) A must have for a John Wayne movie collector.
Wish today's actors were more "men men" as in the past years!!  Only John Wayne could excel in Hondo, The Quiet Man,  Hatari, for example.  Must admire those like Robert Mitchum, Paul Newman, Bob Hope, etc., who were married to the same woman for many years!!!
This gorgeous little movie is one of the few Wayne ever did where the<br />story stays true to the Western genre and doesn't insult your intelligence<br />at the same time. (see<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CMR4">Big Jake</a> for an example of the opposite.)<br />What makes this better is the complexity of the character and the sympathy<br />with which the Apache are portrayed-that was a rarity back then. There is also a wholly enjoyable relationship between Hondo and 'his' dog that culminates in one of the most shocking scenes ever in a western.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author ofbang BANG: A Novel
I have a theory about this film. I am guessing that Wayne so wanted to play Shane that, when he didn't get the role, he went and made this film. The story of an outsider hero redeeming himself should certainly appeal to Shane fans for the parallels.<br /><br />This is a great Western and I would even go so far as to say that it is in some ways better than Wayne's Ford-directed films (which one could also say about Alamo, which he made later and became notorious for because he campaigned so hard for the film to get an Oscar).<br /><br />It would certainly be an awesome experience to see it in 3D on a big screen.
Simply put - Honda is a classic Western movie that any Duke fan should watch. John Wayne puts in a great performance as the outcast Hondo who stumbles upon trouble between the settlers, US Army, and Apaches. Not a stranger to troubld Hondo manages to stay alive and protect others in this rather dangerous situation.<br /><br />This movie contains classic Western scenes - like the horse chase scene where Honda tries to outrun the Apaches, or the final battle scene where the Army "circles the wagons" to defend against the vicious attack. The characters are memorable, and the dialogue is quite entertaining. John Wayne is perfect for the role of Hondo. His real man approach to problems is refreshing.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have provided the plot details. Needless to say the story is entertaining, and even includes a love story subplot. I highly recommend this class movie to any John Wayne fan, or those who like Westerns from the 50s. You will enjoy this one.
This is one of "The Duke's" best performances. He portrays Hondo Lane, a tough loner with a dark past but at the same time a man with high morals. The movie is true to Louis LaMour's book and Wayne does the character justice. The quality of this film is great (It was actually a 3-D picture) and the features are entertaining and informative. Wayne's late son Michael appears in one of the features. The DVD cover displays one of the most famous images of Wayne and it is from the first scene when Hondo walks in from nowhere and into the lives of the supporting characters. If you are wishing to start a John Wayne collection, Hondo is a great one to begin with. Also reccomended: The Sands of Iwo Jima, The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance, True Grit.
"Do what you want to do" was cavalry scout Hondo Lane's philosophy of life for dealing with people. Lane (John Wayne)held to the notion that showing was better than telling where human interactions were involved, and that lessons learned first hand tended to stay with you longer than did advice given.<br /><br />Hence he'd give up telling a boy (Lee Aaker...later "Corporal Rusty" to tv's Rin Tin Tin) not to try petting a feral dog and let him "do what he wanted to do". He did, and he got bit. And learned his lesson. Lane figured if you did what you wanted, you'd either end up right or wrong. If you ended up right, good for you. If you came up wrong you took the consequences, learned the lesson (hopefully), and wouldn't make the same kind of mistake again. A bit of a spin on Nietsche's "That which does not kill you makes you strong" philosophy.<br /><br />  A tough philosophy, but one that would serve one well in the<br /><br />1880s desert southwest during the violent Apache wars.<br /><br />  This film is one I have long adored, but haven't seen in many years until this new DVD release from Paramount. I remember when I saw it first, where I saw it first, and under what circumstances. Saw it as a first grader when it came out in '53. My dad picked me up from school on his day off and took me to an afternoon matinee at the Plaza Theatre in Greenville, SC. I ate this movie up and, despite some of the info given out by Leonard Maltin and others on this new disc to the effect that the 3D version only showed in NY and LA and maybe one or two other big cities, I know for a FACT that I SAW it in 3D here in Joanne Woodward's home town because I was chattering for<br /><br />DAYS about arrows and spears flying out at you from the screen,<br /><br />and about horses almost trampling you....and weird little green and red plastic glasses you had to wear to see it. Sorry Mr. Maltin, I love you as a movie critic and I know you have good sources on your film histories...but you're just WRONG about THIS one!<br /><br />  Great film this, 3D OR 2d. Great performances,great cinematography, great stunt work, great story, great dialog, and...beyond just performances...great CHEMISTRY between the principles. This is one of the best Duke westerns; right up there with Red River, the Searchers, Rio Bravo, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Shootist. As a six-year-old at it's release I carried away from it two burning images: a steely-eyed Hondo walking slowly up to an apprehensive Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page)and son at the beginning of the film, and the fatal spearing of Sam the dog by Rudy Acosta's evil Chirachaua sub-chief later on in the movie.<br /><br />  Was glad that Acosta "got his" at the end, but was sorry that Vittorio(Michael Pate) died. Didn't Pate play a cowboy vampire in some B-grade horror movie? I'd swear I could put his face to such a thing. Also find it interesting that the Hondo Lane character was deemed so popular in the 1950s that Warner Brothers re-worked him a little bit and put him forth (albeit a lot less hard-edged) a few years later as "Bronco Layne"...with a "y" added...in the person of actor Ty Hardin (who looked a bit like PATRICK Wayne). And then in the 60s ABC did a straight (but short-lived) series version of Hondo starring Ralph Taeger. Okay...but NOT the Duke.<br /><br />  Glad to recommend "Hondo"...the DUKE'S Hondo...to any and all fans of the western genre.
I found this movie too be a good character study for the duke.  It made a conserted try at bridging the gap between the white/settlers vs. the native americans/plains indians on how they related on a one to one basis instead of the enmasse scenarios which usually occupy the screen.  It made for a more entaining surprise that what was available for the times in the treatment of our native americans.  I highly recommend it for its simple format and good character study over any of the fight scenes that were shown.  A fine simple approach which is missing from the current lot of movies.
Action-packed John Wayne western receives a Blu-Ray release that debuts, for the first time on home video, a proper widescreen presentation of "Hondo."<br /><br />Wayne plays a half-Indian Cavalry rider named Hondo who finds himself playing guardian angel to a frontierswoman (Geraldine Page, who garnered an Oscar nomination here in her first film role) whose husband has left her and their young son alone to fend for themselves in the New Mexico desert, where warring Apaches roam the landscape. Wayne favorite John Edward Grant adapted a Louis L'Amour story for this effective western, efficiently directed by John Farrow, with Ward Bond, Michael Pate and James Arness appearing in supporting roles.<br /><br />Out of circulation for many years, "Hondo" was originally shot in 3-D but hasn't reportedly been screened in its native format in years. While it's disappointing that Paramount's Blu-Ray edition isn't in 3-D, "Hondo" nevertheless makes an impressive debut in high-definition despite highly varied elements. When the image is at its best, the transfer is spectacular, offering strong colors and fine grain. There are stretches of the picture, however, where the image is notably blurry and seemingly processed with noise reduction, likely a response to opticals and/or damaged source materials. That said, despite its occasional visual discrepancies, the image is exceptionally good on balance. The audio, meanwhile, is much less distinguished, being presented in either a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD track that sounds too airy and lacks power, or a superior 2.0 Dolby TrueHD mono track that enhances the dialogue. The score, credited to Emil Newman and Hugo Friedhofer, comes off well, but there's a thinness to the dialogue that makes the 5.1 track in particular quite unappealing.<br /><br />A variety of insightful features are carried over from Paramount's prior DVD Special Edition, with an introduction from Leonard Maltin, commentary with Maltin and fellow Wayne experts, multiple featurettes and an HD trailer included. The original Intermission sequence has been retained as well.
Hondo ranks among the best of Duke's work and is a classic among classics.  It my be my all time favorite John Wayne movie even though i have not seen it for decades.  it left such an impact with its simple yet compelling story
The Weary Professor is right. I'm no western movie expert, as evidenced by the fact that I rank Hondo just below The Searchers in John Wayne's western canon. Some of the exchanges between Wayne and Paige are the most memorable ever to appear in cowboy cinema, and Sam the dog stands as one of the more memorable devices ever used to delineate his owner's character. That said, the film was compromised during shooting by the unfortunate 3-D process, which results in one shot being razor sharp and the next being out of focus, alternating throughout. It makes Hondo a bigger challenge to bring to Blu than How The West Was Won turned out to be, and, unfortunately, they blew it.<br /><br />There was never going to be any cure for blurred 3-D compositions, but having just viewed the Blu-Ray, I don't think this film really was composed for widescreen. It may have been composed in such a way that widescreen projection was possible, but seen in that aspect ratio the compositions are obviously crowded and cramped. The lost vertical information in this case includes necessary head room and landscape that feels 'missing', and figures cut off distractingly around elbow height, leading to a claustrophobic experience. Westerns are often the best argument in favour of widescreen presentation, restoring the grandeur of landscape vistas lost in pan and scan vhs transfers, but in this instance the top and bottom information we have lost to the imposition of a matte letterbox is absolutely as destructive. Those who continue to take issue with the Weary Professor's opinion on this matter should get out their old fullscreen dvds and simply have a look: I don't think there's any doubt that what we've been given here is a badly compromised Blu-ray that cries out for a replacement edition. The proof is that THE COMPOSITIONS LOOK BAD in widescreen, and look right in full frame. And given the amount of space available on a Blu-Ray, there's no excuse for the fullscreen print not having been made available on the same disc. We've lost picture, but not only that, by zooming the image we've lost resolution, the latter being something this movie really can't afford.<br /><br />In short, you aren't alone Professor. This release is a screw-up, and a bad one. I love widescreen, but this new trend toward shoehorning everything into widescreen just to fit our new TVs is every bit as destructive as the old practice of shearing the periphery of prints in order to get them to fit our old TVs. The fact is, in this case, rather than cutting out the grandeur of the vista, they've crowded the sky out over John Wayne's head. The effect is the same: to shrink the wide open spaces, and it really hurts the experience here. The framing is so tight that if the letterbox were any narrower the disc would go from disappointing to unwatchable.
I'm a true John Wayne fan. I will collect as many of his films as possible. Hondo is one of his best. Geraldine Page won an oscar for this film. John should have too. They were HOT! I liked the dog too.
John Wayne plays Hondo Lane, a character who was Louis L'Amour's first big hit, and the first book he wrote under his own name. It's a pretty typical L'Amour story, which is to say a good western adventure. Geraldine Page plays Angie Lowe, a wife who has been abandoned by her no-good husband, but refuses to accept that he won't come back. Her young son, Johnny, likes Hondo at once when he stops at their remote ranch to get some water and a horse after loosing his running from Apaches. Mrs. Lowe finds this hard to understand, because her family has always gotten along with the Apaches.<br /><br />Vittorio, the Apache warrior who shows up next, explains that the whites have violated the treaty, and threatens Mrs. Lowe. But Johnnie, only six, stands up to them bravely, and Vittorio makes him a blood brother, calls him Small Warrior, and agrees to protect him and Mrs. Lowe.<br /><br />How Hondo meets and eventually kills Mr. Lowe, helps the cavalry hold off the Apaches, and wins the heart of Angie, is a nice story but not all that unusual. One interesting side-line in the story is the dog Sam, who travels with Hondo but is independent of him.
Quality is good, product is what I expected.  Delivery was excellent.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for John Wayne movies.
It had been years since I'd seen this John Wayne classic and it was good to watch again.  My husband enjoyed this birthday gift very much!  The issues dealt with in the film seem to me very advanced for the time it was made, granted it was not "that long ago" in the scheme of time but it had a more positive social comment on the treatment of Native Americans than most films of that genre.  I liked the heartwarming story line and the action was appropriate to the story.  Well done, and one I consider a must-have for any John Wayne fan.
Most other John Wayne westerns show the Indians as faceless attackers. Not this one! Cavalryman Hondo Lane (John Wayne), himself part Apache, has a working relationship with one of the Apache chiefs. He alludes to the fact that the US government had broken a treaty with the Apaches.<br /><br />Hondo gets to know a solitary-living pioneer woman, Angie Lowe, and her six year-old son Johnny. The absence of her husband leads to problems, such as an Apache chief wanting to take her as his wife. At one point, the six year-old shoots an Apache in defense of his mother. The plot unfolds in more ways than one, as Hondo and Angie develop feelings for each other, and Hondo has to acknowledge what he knows about her husband's death. For her part, she has to realize the fact that the Apaches will soon kill her if she does not flee, and deal with the fact that her husband had been a lout and cheat, and how her little son is to remember his father. Dying an honorable death is paramount in that culture.<br /><br />There are several savage battles shown between the Apaches and the settlers. Only the death an Apache leader will cause the Apache warriors to disperse.<br /><br />WARNING: Some of the scenes are quite violent, even by the standard of westerns, which may upset sensitive viewers. There is a scene of Hondo's faithful dog impaled by a pole. There is a mortal knife fight, and a scene of Hondo being staked to the ground and in the act of being tortured by fire.
Not only is this a great movie, but the DVD has loads of extras including a making of feature, a commentary, photo gallery, trailers, and more.  This is the first time I have ever seen this movie and being able to watch it on full screen, in the comfort of my own home, without loud kids or loud adults, is great.  Geraldine Page is a good actor and lovely to boot.  John Wayne is, of course, perfect in this movie as Hondo Lane who is the lone cavalry rider who becomes the hero of the film.
This is a terrific movie.  It has everything a good, old-fashioned western should have.  Scenery, indians and good guys and bad ones.  I thought they would never release it...and am so glad they finally did. Great story...and great cast.
The best John Wayne western not directed by John Ford or Howard Hawks, "Hondo" shows the Duke at the peak of his powers. Helmed by John Farrow (Mia's dad), the film is stunningly photographed, with a tight, trim story brought to life by a luminous Page (in her film debut), the ever-reliable Ward Bond as Hondo's friend Buffalo Baker, and Michael Pate as Vittorio, the Apache chief. Also look for James Arness in a pivotal role- he'd go on to make his career in Westerns on TV's long-running "Gunsmoke".
No wonder 3-D never took off.  "Hondo" has the makings of a really great film but the makers of the film are so concerned with projectile images emanating from the screen("Watch the Duke shod a horse!" "Wonder at that Apache spear that whizzes at you!") that they compromise a great story.  John Wayne though does a terrific job as Hondo Lane, the half-breed with the ambiguous past.  The film suggests a dark side to Hondo's character that is not fully exploited here but in a scant few years Wayne would tackle Ethan Edwards in "The Searchers" who was a fully developed morally complex individual.  Geraldine Page, deserving of her Oscar nomination for her work here, assays a non-stereotypical account of the frontier woman.  The film also offers an enlightened view of the Apaches.  I give this film a pass but it's a shame that it compromised story for the sake of faddish technology.
Thirty years after his death, John Wayne remains an enigma. Many books have been written about him, none of which I've read, and so I know little of his personal life other than he has been both praised for embodying traditional American ideals and reviled for his archconservative bigotry.<br /><br />Yet he remains today perhaps this country's biggest movie star. Today's actors - Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson, Jack Nicholson - are more accomplished actors with greater range; while from Wayne's era, Clark Gable was more handsome, James Cagney more talented, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda more eclectic. But for sheer screen charisma, I can't think of another actor from any era who brings more to the screen. Whenever Wayne is onscreen the viewer is simply compelled to watch him. Often described as ruggedly handsome, his face isn't particularly expressive. Some of his mannerisms, particularly his walk and some of his posturing, one suspects are contrived, yet a generation of men in the 40s and 50s aspired to be just like him. Heck, I knew some women in the 60s who patterned themselves after the Duke.<br /><br />In Hondo, based on a Louis L'Amour novel and directed by John Farrow, Wayne plays a half-breed Apache. His sidekick is Sam, a dog as surly as Hondo. Hondo befriends Angie Lowe, a New Mexican farmwoman and mother of a young son whose husband deserts her for extended periods of time. Geraldine Page is well-cast as the "handsome" Angie, and was nominated for an Oscar for her first starring role, despite a performance that can best be described as wooden. Character actor Ward Bond and a young James Arness ably lend support.<br /><br />Setting aside the rather clich&eacute; depiction of the Apache and several historical inaccuracies, Hondo can perhaps best be described as a morality play, a study of the power of lies and when, or if, it is beneficial to tell one. Hondo laments the lies the white man tells the Apache and tells Angie that the Apache language contains no word for "lie." Page's soliloquy on the subject of lies - those she endured at the tongue of her husband as well as those she told herself - near the end of the movie is a telling moment. Although delivered somewhat mechanically, the words speak for themselves.<br /><br />Not ranked in the top ten best all time westerns or even one of Wayne's best films, it is still recommended viewing.
This is one of many John Wayne films I worked on as a stuntman. It was fun working with him and he will always be the essence of American to the bone. This is truly a great film, directed by John Farrow. Lots of action and Indian raids make it a spectacular event.
"Hondo" is a 1953 3-D western. Westerns were extremely popular at the time, and 3-D was the studio's answer to the challenge of TV. The "golden era" of 3-D started with Bwana Devil in 1952 and "House of Wax" followed. Even Disney produced a 3-D cartoon ("Melody") and the first 3-D western was released by Columbia ("Fort Ti"). 3-D faded as quickly as it began, and Hondo was also released in the 2-D version. You'll notice, when watching the film, that many of the scenes cater to the 3-D experience, including being stabbed by a knife and stuck with a lance.<br /><br />Hondo stars John Wayne with Geraldine Page, Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness, and Paul Fix.<br /><br />Wayne was a major box office draw at the time, having appeared in such hits as "Stagecoach" (1939), "They Were Expendable" (1944), "Fort Apache" (1948), "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" (1949), "Rio Grande" (1950), and "Flying Leathernecks" (1951). He was nominated for Best Actor for "Sands of Iwo Jima" (1949). "Hondo" was Wayne's 135th film.<br /><br />"Hondo" was made at a time that Wayne was feeling his oats as an actor and a producer. He formed Batjac in 1952 and "Big Jim McLain" was his first film, made with Warners. Hondo followed shortly thereafter, and among Batjac's Wayne films were "Cahill" (1973), "Big Jake" (1971), "McClintock" (1963), "The Green Berets" (1968),  "McQ" (1974) and the only really good Batjac film, "The Alamo" (1960). Batjac also did the 1967 TV series "Hondo" in which Michael Pate resurrected his role as Chief Vittorio, and Batjac made several non-Wayne films like "Cast a Giant Shadow" (1966) with Wayne's buddy Kirk Douglas and "Seven Men From Now" (1956) with his friend and occasional co-star Gail Russell. "Seven Men" was originally intended for Wayne, but he was too busy and substituted Randolph Scott: together with Budd Boetticher, Scott made a whole slew of memorable B westerns in the 50s.<br /><br />Hondo comes at a time when artistically Wayne was at his peak. Some of his finest films were made at  this time, including "The Quiet Man" (1952), "The High and the Mighty" (1954), and "The Searchers" (1956).<br /><br />Geraldine Page made her screen debut in this film. She had been a popular stage actress, famous for working in "the method" and trained by Lee Strasberg. Just prior to making Hondo she appeared with James Dean on Broadway. For her work she would receive an Oscar nomination as "Best Supporting Actress", the only nomination the film would earn.<br /><br />Ward Bond plays a scout and long time friend of Wayne. Bond was a football player at USC with Wayne, and together they appeared in nearly a dozen films including "They Were Expendable" (1945), "Fort Apache" (1948), "3 Godfathers" (1948), "The Searchers" (1956), "Wings of Eagles" (1957), and "Rio Bravo" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in John Ford's stock company and appeared in "Young Mr. Lincoln" (1939), "Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)", "My Darling Clementine" (1946), and "The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series "Wagon Train" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film "Wagon Master" in which he appeared (along with James Arness). Bond was in more  Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture.<br /><br />James Arness was Marshall Dillon on TV's "Gunsmoke" from 1955 to 1975 and subsequently has returned every so often for various Gunsmoke TV movies. Before he put on the star for Dodge City, Arness was a film actor, appearing most notably as the monster in "The Thing" (1951). He got his big break from John Wayne who cast him in four films in the early 50s. In fact, the original role as Marshall Dillon was offered to Wayne who turned it down and suggested Arness.<br /><br />Paul Fix is best remembered as the Marshall in the TV series "The Rifleman" (1958 - 63), but he made more than 100 films and appeared on hundreds of TV shows. Fix was a teaching coach for the young Wayne and Wayne included him in 26 of his films, including "Big Jim McCain" (1952), "Island in the Sky" (1953), "High and the Mighty" (1954), "The Sea Chase" (1955), "El Dorado" (1966), and "Cahill" (1973).<br /><br />Michael Pate appears as an Indian chief. Born in Australia, Pate was a busy actor who made more than 50 films. His role as an Indian in Hondo was his first entry into this character, but it soon followed with many more such roles, including a spot on the TV series made in the 60s. Later in his career Pate was very busy in TV, appeared in more than 300 shows, often as a villain.<br /><br />Lee Aaker plays Page's son. Aaker is best remembered as Rusty from the TV show "Rin Tin Tin" (1954 - 9). At the time of "Hondo" he was a busy child actor with roles in "The Greatest Show on Earth" (1952), "High Noon" (1952), "Atomic City" (1952), and "A Lion is in the Streets" (1953). After his TV series he had trouble getting adult roles and retired from acting.<br /><br />John Farrow directs. Farrow was the father of actress Mia Farrow with Margaret O'Sullivan (Jane from the Tarzan films). Farrow was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning for "Around the World in 80 Days" (1956) and nominated for "Wake Island" (1942). Farrow worked with Wayne again in 1955 on "The Sea Chase"<br /><br />The film will not disappoint John Wayne fans, and in fact it is one of his more romantic roles with lots of passionate kissing, a rare event in most Wayne films, especially in Wayne westerns. The photography is excellent although the action sequences are not impressive.
I would rate is a 4-star DVD.  I am a John Wayne and a Louis L'Amour fan. I love westerns.  The movie Hondo is true to L'Amour's book, it's almost verbatim. The characters are strong and the story is exciting.  You can't go wrong with a combination like that.  Andrea
this is a review of the DVD and not the film. I don't think I could add any more to what has already been said about one of John Wayne's best but seldom seen films until it was released on video. It was made in 3D in 1953 before movies were made in wide screen. I was really looking forward to the blu-ray release. Unfortunately, they letterboxed a movie that was not made in wide screen. They simply cut the bottom and top of the picture off. If you have seen the film as it was meant to be seen you can tell. Starting in 1956 the studios told their dirctors that if they were going to shoot a film in standard 1.33 to 1 ration that their movies would be cropped in the theaters and to shoot their films accordingly. This lead to a number of films having some dead space at the top or bottom of the film. manyd films such as "Support Your Local Sheriff" and "The Devil at 4 O'Clock" were filmed that way. Hondo was made before this practice was started. For me this is unforgivable and I will be returning my blu-ray. This is the same as releasing a widescreen movie in pan and scan.
"Hondo" has long been one of my favorite John Wayne westerns and it is such a joy to see it treated well on this blu ray release. The picture and sound are wonderful and the extras are great as well. The remixed surround track is a welcome edition as well. The extras include a "Making Of Hondo" special with Leonard Maltin and is very interesting with highlights including new interviews with Michael Pate and Lee Aaker. A great snippet from "ET" when Maltin was shown original "Hondo" items from Michael Wayne himself. The theatrical trailer is very nice as well as I had never seen it in its entirety. A very nice release and great price. Makes a great gift for any Wayne fan and as usual Amazon's shipping and service was top notch. Now if we could just get new blu rays of "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"..."The Sons of Katie Elder"..."The Shootist" and "El Dorado"...I'll be a happy guy!
This is one of John Wayne's best movies !!!! Kind of reminded me of one of my all time favorites "Shane".
John Wayne is the best there is and always will be! A true american icon!
This is a great movie adaptation of a very good book by Louis L'Amour.  If you like his books & you like John Wayne, how could it be wrong?
This item was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.  I have already watched it a couple of times and it plays very well.
I remember in the very early `90s, Hondo was shown on television in 3D. It was a big deal, and being a kid who loved Westerns, I begged my dad to take me to 7-11 where they were selling the 3D glasses. Well, the big night came and I loved Hondo! After that, I didn't see it again until its recent release on Blu-ray. This is a great Wayne film! I had forgotten much of the movie in the twenty-plus years since I had seen it, so it was basically like watching it for the first time. The picture looks great, and the sound is better than it had been in past home video editions (I saw two or three minutes of it on DVD once, and the sound was not so great).<br /><br />As for the film itself, the story moves along at a brisk pace and is never boring. There are shoot-outs, chases, plenty of suspense, and even a knife fight! Even though I just bought and watched my Blu-ray a few weeks ago, I already want to see this film again!<br /><br />The movie is very clean and is suitable for almost all ages (I have no problem with my seven year old son watching it). As a bonus we get an introduction by the always wonderful Leonard Maltin. In addition, there is a commentary track with Maltin and Frank Thompson (Frank has a very good podcast called The Commentary Track that fans of classic films should love-look it up!). Overall, this is a great movie released in a great format.
I bought this movie for the wife, when asked how she would review it she said " Hell yeah, as good now as when it first came out, And John Wayne to boot. How can you go wrong with John Wayne?"
I've viewed this movie several times and always enjoy it.  It stays very close to the story line in the book.  Always an entertaining film.
Good john wayne movie. Love the blu ray quality good story. Hope to see more blu ray westerns especially the good ones.
Beautifully done.  I would have liked to have seen it released as a 3D movie, like it was originally.  Even as a dual pack would have been nice.
Maybe I'm biased, but I think every John Wayne western adventure is worth owning.  This one is no exception.  Right off the bat, when the lettering hits the screen, it is exceptionally bright and crisp, something totally lacking in any other DVD transfer I've seen.  I found myself not so much listening directly to the Duke and the other characters, but looking at the scenery that is truely spectacular.  I did not watch it on my home theater system, instead watching it in the bedroom.  The time flew by.  Most of John Wayne's westerns are now out on Blue-Ray, some harder to find than others but all worth the again purchase price to own.  You will not regret getting this.
For 1953 Hondo was a brutal portrayal of the West. Hondo was based on a Louis L'Amour novel, in fact, it was the first novel that L'Amour had published & was also his first property to be transformed to the silver screen. The film was directed by John Farrow (father of Mia) & shot in Mexico. The screenplay was written by James Edward Grant, Wayne's favorite screenwriter.<br /><br />Hondo is a Western much in the classic vein but with an added realism that was unusual for 1953. In the opening scene we see Hondo (John Wayne) walking toward the camera, rifle in one hand, scabbard & saddlebags in the other hand. Near him is the dog, Sam, basically a wild dog who is in the company of Hondo. He happens on a ranch that has only Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) & her son Johnny (Lee Aker). Hondo is a scout for the cavalry & is returning to to report on the state of the Apaches who are preparing for war. Hondo stays around the ranch for a short period fixing up things for her. It's obvious to Hondo that Mrs. Lowe's husband hasn't been around for a long time. She continually lies about her husband but Hondo, straigt forward & honest, tells her she's lying. Later, Hondo meets Ed Lowe (Leo Gordon) & they take an immediate disliking to one another. Later Hondo kills Lowe in self-defense. This complicates things because Hondo & Mrs. Lowe end up falling in love.<br /><br />All of this is set against the backdrop of an Apache uprising & the Lowe ranch is in the middle of it. She has been on peaceful terms with them but Hondo warns her it's time for her & her son to leave. She chooses to stay. The Apache chief Vittorio (Michael Pate) is a significant role in the movie. He befriends Johnny renaming him Small Warrior. Vittorio wants Mrs. Lowe to pick one of the Apache warriors for a husband so that Johnny can be taught the Apache way. The movie features Ward Bond as Buffalo Baker, a scout like Hondo. James Arness has a small role as Lennie, another scout whom Hondo doesn't like. It all leads to the inevitable cowboy & Indian showdown.<br /><br />Some of this was shot in 3D but it's a very minuscule part. The movie has an introduction by Leonard Maltin who also appears in the rest of the special features. There's a feature entitled The Making of Hondo that features interviews with Michael Pate, Lee Aaker & western historian Frank Thompson. This feature reveals that the final parts filmed of Hondo were actually directed by John Ford. There's a feature on the writer James Edward Grant. There is an interview with Michael Wayne that reveals material from the vaults of Batjac, Wayne's production company. There are a couple of other features that makes this a great value.
Excellent movie and in my opinion one of the Duke's best. It sent the usual John Wayne message of good versus bad. The ending was weak, in my opinion, but the main body was very well done. One of my favorites<br /><br />Bob leray
John Wayne is, as usual, "the Duke" in this western. He plays Hondo Lane a cavalry scout. The film is directed by John Farrow and for a few sequences by John Ford. Geraldine Page is the feminine interest of the movie, mother of Lee Aaker (rusty of rintintin) and wife then widow of Leo Gordon. Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness and Rodolfo Acosta complete the cast. The special features are suberb and very documented. For "Duke" fans and others.
John Wayne has again made a wonderful movie, now available on DVD.<br /><br />I have never seen a movie that he made that wasn't great.<br /><br />The price for this DVD was a great deal!
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YWV56Y">HONDO:SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION</a> WOW! A John Wayne movie I had never seen before. I read somewhere that it had been released for DVD not to long ago. A very good movie that I really enjoyed. But then, no one tops "The Duke"! I couldn't believe that I had never seen the movie before, altho the title was familiar to me. So I bought it and thoroughly enjoyed it. A typical John Wayne movie, full of action, some romance, adventure and some sadness. Also shows that the Indians were just as human as the White Establishment, of that time. I am so glad that I bought it and added it to my, not only collection of good Western movies, but my John Wayne collection as well. "The Special Features" was good on this DVD also. The little boy in this movie, tells of his (Lee Aaker) experience of working on this movie with John Wayne. Also, is very detailed of how the Apache people were treated when Geronimo surrendered. It is heartbreaking to know how the Native American Indians were and are treated, even today. The Apache and The Lakota Sioux tribes were the ones who fought so valiantly to keep their land and way of life, only to be demorialized by the white people who wanted to exterminate them. Change their whole lives because the white people wanted them to be what "they" thought they should be. It makes me quite Happy today to see that the Native American Tribes are relearning their own language and customs once again. Chief Red Cloud said it best:  "THEY MADE US MANY PROMISES, MORE THAN I CAN REMEMBER. BUT THEY KEPT BUT ONE - THEY PROMISED TO TAKE OUR LAND... AND THEY TOOK IT."<br /><br />Very well packaged and recieved in good time.
Hondo (John Wayne), a half breed who sometimes scouts for the Army, becomes involved with a homesteader woman (Geraldine Page) and her young son (Lee Aaker) during a time when the pressure of the westward expansion is bringing conflict with the local Apaches to the boiling point.<br /><br />Wayne and Page give good performances, and the character of Hondo, with his unswerving but intensely personal sense of honesty and his antisocial dog, is interesting, but John Farrow's direction is uninspired.  The final battle, which was shot by John Ford, is an improvement.  Characters pay lip service to the nobility of the Apache way of life and the white man's responsibility for the conflict with them, but the filmmakers' sympathies are clearly with the settlers, as the Apaches are a constantly threatening presence, even when they are being magnanimous.
this product came as promised and arrived in time for Christmas.  I had purchased it  a little late in the chirstms season but I received it in time!  product in excellelnt shape
A good movie, till the moment whites left the ranch. I have a very high respect for Apaches. But in here they, as always in the movies, behave in a stupid way. Appart from Vittorio, a great chief,  the rest looks like a bunch of ragged men that attack whites with little or no strategy. They normally don't charge in the open to some hostile force but choose their grounds in a clever way.<br /><br />The sad matter was, as John Wayne says in the movie, "a whole way of life was erased from earth"<br /><br />It is not different from what is happening today in a lot of things.
This was one of the first Duke films I saw (back in '82 on Cable TV, not in theaters in the 50's) so it shaped my thoughts of him. He gets caught and humbled by the savage indians and he spends some time in the film talking to a little boy (and the kid's mother). But in spite of therse humble elements of story he still remains larger than life as a character and presence. Excellent cinematography too.
