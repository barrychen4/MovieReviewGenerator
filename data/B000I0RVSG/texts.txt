I ordered this movie, for my girlfriend on April 9th. Amazon shipped it out pretty fast and that was really cool giving me an estimated delivery date for May 6th. But I recieved it around 2 weeks earlier. Great speed, service. The product was as said, new and sealed. It was awesome service.<br /><br />But the sad thing was that the DVD quality wasn't as good. It was as if you were watching the movie from an old box TV via antenna. Seriously! But i guess its not amazons fault. But being an old movie, i guess its ok.<br /><br />Thing is, my girlfriend really loved it. So it all worked out well for me. I'm glad i bought it, the price, shipping speed, and service was all great. Just the product with the scanlines bothered me. A must have for any one who loved this movie
