The video started out great with Mr. Segovia playing a couple of peices but quickly degraded to just scenes of the Spanish country-side with only the music being played in the background.<p>If I was interested in seeing  Spain, I would have bought a video to that end.<p>I wish I could return  this tape but unfortunately you cannot return opened video  packages!!!<p>Extremely disappointed, expected more playing and less  scenery.
This extraordinary video lacks about a relationship of the repertory of pieces performed by Maestro Andres Segovia. I detail them next for all those that are interested:<p>(1)-LA MAJA DE GOYA, by Enrique Granados (arrangement Miguel Llobet).<p>(2)-SARABANDE from Lute Suite I, BWV 996, by J.S.Bach.<p>(3)-GAVOTTE EN RONDEAU, from Lute Suite IV, BWV1006A, and Violin Partita III BWV 1006, by J.S.Bach.<p>(4)-FANDANGUILLO from 'Suite Castellana', by F.M.Torroba.<p>(5)-LA FILLA DEL MARXANT ('The Merchant's Daughter'), a popular Catalonian song, arranged by Miguel Llobet.<p>(6)-STUDY Lesson 26 from 'The Complete Works for Guitar' Vol.2 page 52 (Chanterelle 802), by Dionisio Aguado.<p>(7)-RECUERDOS DE LA ALHAMBRA (music in background) by Francisco Tarrega.<p>(8)-LA ARRULLADORA, Lullaby from Suite 'Platero and I' by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.<p>(9)-SPANISH DANCE Nr.10-in G by Enrique Granados (arranged by Miguel Llobet).<p>(10)-LA MAJA DE GOYA (music in background), by Enrique Granados.<p>It would be very interesting, for all the fans to the classical guitar, could provide all Videos of Andres Segovia in DVD format.
This video consists of interviews with Segovia at his home and throughout the countryside and villages of Spain in 1969. Three full pieces performed on film,the rest are excerpts or background music narrating shots of the Spanish countryside. Also , footage of a child and donkey ,etc. illustrating a piece from &quot;Platero and I&quot; as Segovia reads from the poem of the same name in Spanish.The coverage of his playing is good , as are the interviews. This has better film coverage and sound of the playing than the &quot;Segovia Legacy&quot; video. video is 1 hour long.Worth the money.
