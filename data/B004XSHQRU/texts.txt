Everyone should watch this movie About "POSA", My Hero. He is the current Swedish Champion for Ice Racing,and will be 65  years old in March.Tremendous Film !
Whether you are a motorcycle racer or an "average" motorcyclist (there really is no average motorcyclist in my humble opinion) who can enjoy spectating a moto race this sport is in a league of its own. Likewise, Per-Olof Serenius also known as "Posa" is a devoted racer and talent phenom to this particular sport.<br /><br />Similar to traditional speedway racing these guys take a big bore single cylinder motor, wind it out to ridiculously high prototype power figures, and then shoehorn it into what looks like a Huffy bicycle frame [...] Then they proceed to drive ghoulishly sharp studs through the left side tire wall, suit up in basic motorcycle race leathers, and pilot their machines through the turns at about as close as you can get to parallel with the track surface. There are no brakes on these bikes, in case you are wondering about that.<br /><br />The video appears to be a tribute to not only ice speedway but also to Posa, a 20 time Swedish champion who even in his 60s remains a tremendous figure in the world championship. Mere mortals like myself are humbled as well as entertained by documentary footage such as this. Highly recommended. A plus production. I have watched it again, and again, and again. Not for the faint of heart.
