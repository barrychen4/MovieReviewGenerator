GREAT MOVIE FOR  KIDS EXCEPT FOR THE F BOMB,
The Goonies for the new millenium!
Had potential for 5 stars, but faded into an ET clone at end
A Powerhouse Movie That Doesn't Avoid Tenderness
LOVE this movie
Amazing
ET revisited, modern style
Thank You Abrams & Spielberg
ET on the cheap
E.T. Meets Cloverfield
Fun, Action-Packed Adventure

E.T. with Jaws

Absolutely worth it!
One of the best of 2011

Interesting, but does not compare to the beloved  "E.T."

Great Fun
Unexpected pleasures
Great movie
Snapshot of An Era
ALIEN GO HOME
JJ Abrams' inspired take on childhood
The most overrated movie of the decade!
JJ Abrams is no Steven Spielberg
Entertaining, engrossing and extra-terrestrial - Derivative but from the very best
1 of the Best films I've seen in 2011 - 5 Stars for both movie and blu-ray transfer
This movie is "Mint!"
Great Fun!
Genuinely Entertaining
'Super 8' is an excellent homage to Spielberg!
Fantastic Movie
Not so like goonies & ET as people are saying
Super 8 Made Me A Kid Again
Spielberg-esque
A Solidly Crafted Blockbuster For 2011
Collision Between "The Goonies" and "The War of the Worlds", with "E.T." as an afterthought,
SUPER 8 - A masterful original story, with omage to Spielbergian Cinema.
Pure excitement!
A well-rounded sci-fi thriller
light entertainment
Super 8 certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it
E.T.'s Crystal Skull of the 3rd Kind
Disappointing
Entertaining -- very derivative of ET and other Spielberg films
Works too hard to be Spielbergesque
An entertaining film
Bad Things Happen to Good People
Lens flares for all!
Spielberg film history, all in one place...
Diverting summer fun
Mostly mint
Starts good, then gets really predictable
OK movie to watch
Only good if you like Speilberg's work
Worth Watching
Decent "Family" movie but not for the hardcore fans of scifi
Super 8 Blunder
Feels like Spielberg and Stephen King
Not at all what I was expecting
a good rental, no need to watch it again.
Super 8 = Super Great!
It's Like THE GOONIES crossed with E.T. with a touch of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND
Liked it
Quintessential Summer Movie!  GREAT!
Good Movie - Definitley worth renting
3.5 more than a 3 but Derivative of ET and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
super 8
Entertaing, okay movie
Expected greatness, and I got it.
Fun!
The Spielberg Replication is a Success
in my book- Aces
Streaming: beware the 43:00 mark!
Awesome
A movie about relationships.
"Production value!!"
Stand By Me/It/Dreamcatcher/ET/Goonies
Fantastic... Right up until the end
Super Nostalgia for Blockbusters Like This One
Excellent for Curing Insomnia
Worth watching once but so far I'm not A fan off JJ Abrams movies
It's All About The Storytelling
A rollercoaster which makes you jump out of your seat
Abrams is "Super"
"Super 8" is brilliant!
weak
How did two great directors create such a lame movie?
Good but not great
Not what I expected
"Super 8" is a new, modern masterpiece.  A bluray review.
Great Film!!
Typical Spielberg
great acting & production, but still a patchwork quilt of cliched plot elements
Missing some logic
First hour was great, then it seemed I was watching ET.
I enjoyed this movie!!! Exciting and Action Packed.
Great Movie
Simple but Great
What the Summer Blockbuster Should Aspire to Be
Train wreck of a movie
Did We See The Same Movie
WOW!!! what a great movie!
I couldn't wait for this steaming pile to end.
Non Stop Entertainment.
Awesome movie
Ups and Downs
Interesting movie - worth watching
Abrams and Spielberg made a great summer blockbuster!
I wanted to love this movie, and I almost did.

For The Kids In Us All
Goonies of  2011
Homeward Bound
Wonderful 80's movie
Big Blu Ray Sound
Enjoyable movie, but kind of falls a bit flat. (potential SPOILERS)
Collage of E.T., Close Encounters and other such stuff
50% "wow!" and 50% "uh, where's the rest of the movie?"
Old School Story Telling
Like cloverfield with kids..
lame
ET meets the Goonies haha
A SUPER Movie!
Love the Goonies? Then you will love this!
Super 8 - Delightfully Expected
Not Without My Mother
Amazing!
Great Movie!!!

THE Summer action movie of 2011

Good but not that good
It's NOT "The Goonies"
Entertaining at first, but disappoints in the end.
derivative and disappointing
Super 8 Blu-Ray
A New Classic Summer Film, and one of best of 2011.

Awesome Movie
Awesome Movie
Feels like a Classic
Super 8
great little movie
1/2 and 1/2
Beautiful, nostalgic film
Great movie!
Thin line between homage and derivative . . . SUPER-8 goes both ways
Bad reviews miss the point, and the heart, of this film
Thank God for you Speilberg
Best film of 2011
Fantastic
Fun, well written movie
Don't get it.
just a warning
Good Sci-Fi
Falls terribly short
8 Was Enough for Me
release the alien
once was enough
Four plus two divided by two equals three.
Super Deal
Flashback...
Can't believe I paid to watch this!
A very good sci/fi thriller that fans of Cloverfield will love. Could have been a little shorter and been better though. I say B
Super Aliens
Terrific Story with Wonderful Acting
Disappointing
"Goonies" meets "Iron Giant"
Intersting Science Fiction Movie
JJ Abrams 'phones home' a winner
Disappointed
Very quick delivery and good movie also.
Great movie!
good movie fo' sho....
Best of the recent Sci-Fi films I've taken a chance with - Blu Ray
Does anyone feel sorry for all of those dumb aliens...
Genre of its own
Very Disapointed
Lukewarm
GREAT MOVIE!
ok movie, but horrible sound mix.
Super 8 (Two-disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo + Digital copy)
super 8. epic
another cheesey si-fi movie
STOLZ
One of the best movies ever!
slow action & 90% of the movie was too dark...??
J.J. Abrams's love letter to Generation X, Spielberg, and Debbie Harry
slowwwwww
Fun Movie
Very Disapointing
Good Movie
Disappointing
Fun but ...
Didn't have the "magic" I expected
IT WAS JUST OK FLICK .. BUT FORGETABEL AFTER SHORT WHILE!!
Good movie, big BUT...
Movie made for kids and then the rest...
Gawd awful
Insipid.
Really a teen movie...
Warmed Over Spielberg for Kids
Cloverfield meets The Goonies
LOST Goonies
so so
Super 8 = Super sweet and Super Scary Fun
Made me love going to the movies again!
Waste
Slow
Watch other movies - not Super 8
E.T. Meets Cloverfield!!!
Good as the hype?
Super8
traditional Speilberg fare
Absolute total disappointment (some "spoilers")
Mediocre 8
NOT Speilberg's best work at all!!
Beautiful and stirring, but surprisingly mechanical and eventually empty....
Has its moments, but ultimately feels like a letdown.
Let's make a hit, says JJ Abrams. So much for making a good movie.
One of the best of 2011!
SUPER 8
If you are a Gen X'er, you should like this movie
Coke, Popcorn, and a Classic Movie
Perfect!
Super 8
Super 8 is SUPER
Great movie
Kicking myself for not seeing it in theaters
"SUPER 8" IS A SUPER ENTERTAINING FLICK!!!
one more for "BORING"!
Sort of ET meets Close Encounters meets ALIEN
Super BAD
A boring re-make of E.T., wasted my time and money.
Dull
Not a "feel good" movie
the best movie in the whole world!!!!!!!!!
Good movie for mental midgets and children
Super 8 rental
Not ET
Intellectual Pablum
Too Borrowed
Goonies vs the Broken-Hearted Cannibal Alien
I never feel compelled to write a review, but...
think Cloverfield
Horrible movie, filled with so many plot holes you could drive a train through it!
Boring
Take away the hype, it's just an OK movie
Another garbage release to empty the wallets of the masses.
One of the worst movies
OK MOVIE...ANNOYING KIDS
Modernized Love Letter to 80s Adventure Flicks is Sometimes Too Indulgent
Alien meets Close Encounters, and definitely disappoints...
Not as fresh as I hoped
Extremely overrated
Tries hard to recapture an era, but just feels derivative
huge disapointment
Super 8 out of focus
WHICH AUDIENCE WAS THIS FILM MADE FOR?
Ok movie with a lose plot
This Movie Doesn't Know What It Wants to Be
Nothing new.........but it's entertaining.
What was that?
Horrible movie & way too dark
Just didn't do it for me
BORING!!!!!
Play it for ten minutes then turn it off.
Expected more from JJ Abrams
ET  Blows it
I've seen this before
It was awful
Aliens.... Really
The kids are annoying and worthless
Train wreck????
worst movie
Had high hopes for this but very disappointed
Missed the greater story for a losing scenario of science fiction
Still Has not Shipped
Terrible
boring and offensive
Boring!!!!
Spielberg clone wins no points for bashing US military and scientific communities
Not E.T., Not Alien, NOT X-Men, Not Jaws, Not the Blob, Not the Goonies
"AUTO-PILOTISH DIRECTION"
How do you get past the original premise?
Sucks save your 3.99
STR8 TRASH! WAT A HEIST!
Christina
super 8

Can only be described as Amazingly.......
7.1 audio track cuts out

Too Vague, Too Forced

A great movie for kids?  Really?
Stupid 8
One of the worst films of 2011
MAD
Super "0"!
Must Balance Out the Retards...
Only Trash
Super 8
I hate these kids
A Classic Spielberg Sci-Fi Romp
All the right ingredients, but not memorable
May not be suitable for younger audiences
I Liked It!
Goonies, E.T., and Cloverfield
SOMEWHAT GOOD BUT I EXPECTED MORE
Charming.
Some fine performances
You'll never want it to end...
Enjoyed every riveting minute
Now this is how fun movies should be!
Super 8 brings back magical moviemaking
I Didn't H8 It, But It Wasn't Gr8
Decent film
A Loving Bow to a Master Film Maker
