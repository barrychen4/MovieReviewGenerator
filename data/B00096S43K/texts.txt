Rubi was amazing on DVD. I have to admit I was a little iffy whether I should buy it because I have purchased other Novelas on DVD and didn't like them. I'm the first to admit, I was wrong. It has the whole show on it and it's not all chopped up either. It even has some extra footage and an alternative ending. I would strongly suggest this to any Rubi fan. The show was great and the DVD dosen't come far behind.
One of the reviewers states that the soap opera is not all chopped up. Rubi on DVD is edited and the often boring subplots are gone from this DVD version. Since some of the scenes are omitted there are some scenes that comment on action that has been editted out of this DVD collections. However, most of the major scenes are there.
Ever since I saw the first episode of Rubi, I was totally hooked. Rubi is a very captivating telenovela from beginning to end. It has all the qualities that make a telenovela great such as greed, passion, deceit, and romance to name a few. This is an awesome DVD to own. I highly recommend it to any Rubi fan. I would also recommend it to any fan of telenovelas. The DVD has English subtitles so you can still enjoy even if you don't speak fluent Spanish. There are a bunch of extras too! You definitely get your money's worth. There are certain parts that have been edited out, but they didn't take out any of the important parts. Another major plus is the price; I was able to purchase it for less than $20.
This novela was truly a spectaucalar one,Rubi is hot,beautiful,and sexy all in one but as she is sexy she is evil.Really a great novela and I would recommend it to anyone.
This is arguably one of the best telenovelas of 2004. The story follows Rubi, a poor, beautiful yet ambitious young woman who stops at nothing to get love and, most importantly, money. By schemes and lies, Rubi finally marries a wealthy man, Hector. Yet she cannot forget the one she truly loves, Alejandro. Rubi finally sees that material things are not as important as true love, goodness and kindness. Yet she denies her wrongdoing and, in the end, her evil ways drive her to disaster and misery.<br /> If you like telenovelas (Spanish soap operas) then you will love this one. The story line is refreshing and bittersweet.<br />EDIT: One important piece of information pertaining to this DVD. It does cut the story line considerably, since the makers TELEVISA do this to all their telenovelas on DVD. Yet the story is still coherent.
I'm now pretty keen to watch and enjoy Rubi as a main character in a telenovela thanks to all those enticing reviews.  It's going to be pretty interesting to watch a character causing so much wretchedness around.  Since I also had doubts about the length of this `telenovela',  it was a reassurance to learn from the DVD's cover that this DVD comes with 3 double sided discs playing 700+ minutes instead of only 1 disc playing only 74 minutes, which it wouldn't make sense after all.
There are some shows that are great because they are meant for families, SCI FI fans, Western lovers, etc. Rubi is great because it is perfect at it's goal of pulling in the viewer and not letting go until the last Rubi-filled scene.<br /><br />Barbara Mori is probably one of the most beautiful women God ever created and she fits well into her part as the vivacious Rubi. The ladies will have plenty of fun with the leading men as well. But this show is about Rubi, everyone else is mainly there to support her.<br /><br />You do not need to understand Spanish to follow the plot. It is subtitled in English but that is not needed either really. The characters come off the screen and grab you and the story follows along well.<br /><br />Rubi is a sinful treat that you will enjoy. I watched it with my wife and we had a ball. If Babrabra Mori needs a handsome Gringo for a stand-in I am available.
La novela no esta entera comienza adelantada y Los capitulos ban cortados no se le entiende no la compren no gasten su dinero
The only reason I gave it three stars was because I absolutely love the novela and it was interesting to see the Rubi that was made still in black and white.<br /><br />Although I saw the warnings that it was chopped up and not the full novela, but I did not think that is actually that bad.<br /><br />But it is very bad basically the story line is lost so many good scenes not there and it was a huge disappointment in that sense.<br /><br />However, I was happy with the product overall it was okay.<br /><br />So if you are a Rubi fan you might still like it, if you want to watch the whole novela do not buy it, its on youtube.
Rubi was very interesting. I really liked Eduardo Santamarina , who played the Dr. Aleandro. He is an excellent actor. Everyone in the novela was good, however , Barbara Mori is not a great actress. Her character is never really developed , other than she's a gold digger. I felt let down at the end, she deserved something really bad for all the things she did. It's not a good ending.  But her character is so evil , sh's so bad, it's sort of funny. But I really love the scene near the finale, when Aleandro tells Rubi he's in love with Maribel, and tells Rubi he's never going back to her ever. Rubi was overall very enjoyable for me . I really love Yadhira Carillo, she was awesome!
This Novela and this dvd were Really perfect  For My Mind Rubi is the biggest and Best novela of Televisa Company And The World<br /><br />Perfectfull, Great :) I Bought This DVD  From Amazon.com its Really Perfect
A Rub&iacute; no la vi en formato de telenovela, sino en DVD, y la verdad es que me pareci&oacute; completa, bendita sea la persona a quien se le ocurri&oacute; comenzar a editar novelas en DVD, as&iacute; nos libramos de tantas subtramas que no le aportan nada a la historia original, &iquest;se imaginan lo que hubi&eacute;ramos podido pasar con las escenas de los personajes de la vecindad??? &iquest;Y qu&eacute; decir de la ambientaci&oacute;n? Me parece que despu&eacute;s de Coraz&oacute;n Salvaje y Amor Real, Rub&iacute; tiene los escenarios m&aacute;s hermosos que nunca se hayan visto, magn&iacute;fica fue la idea de grabar en Canc&uacute;n y otras locaciones que muestran la hermosura de M&eacute;xico. Por otra parte, el vestuario est&aacute; muy bien ajustado y creo que Rub&iacute; derroch&oacute; glamour en casi todos los cap&iacute;tulos de la novela, claro, Maribel, Helena, Sonia y otras tantas no se quedaron atr&aacute;s... Por cierto, Marlene Favela, quien anteriormente protagoniz&oacute; un bodr&iacute;o de lo m&aacute;s infame en Miami, ha mejorado mucho su actuaci&oacute;n en esta novela, mejor para ella. Y hablando de actuaci&oacute;n, todos los personajes est&aacute;n muy bien aunque a veces exageraban un poco, o les faltaba ese algo para convencer m&aacute;s al p&uacute;blico: Paty D&iacute;az, o sea Cristina, se mostr&oacute; muy melodram&aacute;tica en las escenas de llanto sobretodo en las que lloraba a su madre y le echaba la culpa a Rub&iacute;, no me gust&oacute; mucho, y qu&eacute; decir de los vecinos ya me parec&iacute;a estar viendo unos dibujos animados... A Jacqueline Bracamontes, Maribel, le falta todav&iacute;a madurar como actriz, no digo que sea mala, al contrario, pero tiene que perfeccionar a&uacute;n m&aacute;s sus dotes histri&oacute;nicos, creo que esta actriz dar&aacute; de que hablar... ah, y que arregle ese defecto en su boca, &iexcl;que no le sienta nada bien! Me quito el sombrero ante los dos galanes de Rub&iacute;, tanto Eduardo Santamarina como Sebasti&aacute;n Rulli nos han brindado unas actuaciones dignas de buena telenovela, sin exageraciones ni nada que pareciera artificial, ambos est&aacute;n muy bien como Alejandro y H&eacute;ctor respectivamente, hemos podido sentir lo que ellos sufr&iacute;an y disfrutaban a la vez, l&aacute;stima que H&eacute;ctor tuviera que morir pero as&iacute; es la historia y as&iacute; lo requiere el gu&iacute;on. Termino felicitando la elecci&oacute;n de B&aacute;rbara Mori, talento de TV Azteca, importada a Televisa, como la Descarada Rub&iacute;, y no creo que haya ni una artista en Televisa capaz de sacar adelante a ese personaje como lo hizo ella, bueno, s&iacute; hay una, pero que ya no puede presumir de tanta juventud como la Mori, y que lleva a&ntilde;os apartada del mundo art&iacute;stico y de los foros, &iquest;de qui&eacute;n estoy hablando? Pues de qui&eacute;n va a ser? De la que le hizo la vida de cuadritos a la pobre Edith Gonz&aacute;lez en Coraz&oacute;n Salvaje, la que casi mataba a su hermana gemela en Isabela... &iquest;Qui&eacute;n es ella? Es Ana Colchero, estupenda actriz mexicana quien por decisi&oacute;n propia se retir&oacute; porque, como ya lo vemos, las protagonistas femeninas siguen siendo las mismas, sumisas, tontas, lloronas... menos mal que nos sali&oacute; la Rub&iacute;, pero no se alegren tanto, no creo que otros productores se arriesguen como Jos&eacute; Alberto Castro, la hero&iacute;na dulce y tierna sigue la predilecta... Mi querida Ana, un consejo para ti, qu&eacute;date en tu casa, que nos dejaste novelas inolvidables como Coraz&oacute;n Salvaje, Alondra e Isabela, &iexcl;te felicito!<br /><br />Termino diciendo que Rub&iacute; me dej&oacute; un muy buen sabor de boca aunque al final esperaba que la Descarada se redimiera y no terminara tan... tan... bueno, tan mal como termin&oacute;, y me gustar&iacute;a se&ntilde;alar que muy mala fue la idea de dejar pasar los a&ntilde;os y crecer a Fernanda, quien result&oacute; ser el vivo retrato de su t&iacute;a Rub&iacute;, para que vengara su suerte... La verdad es que no he podido contener la risa al ver a una Maribel madre de un muchacho de 18 a&ntilde;os, o a un Alejandro con bigotes, y la peluca rubia de Fernanda no le quedaba nada bien!! Es verdad que el tiempo pas&oacute;, &iexcl;pero para Rub&iacute; no! con sus cicatrices y pierna de menos, la Perversa sigui&oacute; manteniendo su juventud... La pregunta es: &iquest;qu&eacute; es lo que nos espera? En qu&eacute; estar&aacute; pensando el productor, acaso no ha aprendido que las secuelas siempre fracasan? Nada m&aacute;s ver las grandes producciones de Hollywood para darse cuenta de ello, mejor Rub&iacute; hubiera tenido un final digno, con la muerte de la Descarada que tanto da&ntilde;o ha causado, o bien hacer que se arrepintiera de todo y se dedicara a obras de caridad... no s&eacute;, cualquier cosa.
Una novela muy bonita ,pero el final esta inconcluso y no me gusto para nada.
Every young woman yearns for a life full of prosperity, some of us sweat blood and tears to achieve those expectations we call happiness. While other's bend beyond the boundaries of evil to reach a life full of wealth and luxury.<br /><br />Rubi is exactly that, a tale of a young woman born into poverty but destines to live a life full of wealth and luxury and will go to any length to achieve her goal.<br /><br />From the beginning I was hoping that someday Rubi would realize that having all the money in the world would not be the key to her happiness. But watching every single step of her immorality is what had me hooked.<br /><br />Rubi was full of shocking and unthinkable moments. Abandoning her true love and stealing her best friend's fianc&eacute; were two pivotal situations that had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />At the end, once it was too late, Rubi realizes that wealth and luxury is not the key to happiness.<br /><br />I found Rubi to be very rewarding because it depict the notion that good always prevails over evil.
I receieved Rubi on DVD promptly and in perfect codition .  There are 3 DVD's that play on both sides.  Nothing extra special.  Good price and fast shipping, I can't complain.
I have looked everywhere for this novela and I finally found it on amazon. It is great and I love it.
Me gusto la Edicion del Dvd, la verdad es que esta bien editado, y tiene mucha coherencia. Lo que no me gusto fue que le sacaron el tema de Reyli, La Descarada y pusieron otro que se llama Mala Mujer, pero esta bien, dentro de todo, no es mala la cancion, pero no tiene la Original. Despues note que la Musicalizacion no es la misma que la de la Transmision Televisiva. Los Extras son Muy Buenos, Contiene Bloopers y El Especial de Rubi contado por su sobrina y Loreto, aunque la parte final queda inconclusa. Tiene una Duracion de Mas de 780 Minutos y la Presentacion, la Portada y el Dise&ntilde;o esta Muy Lindo!!!
It was pleasant to watch. It had lots of parts cut.  Pretty much all interesting parts were there.  Nice extras like bloopers.  Blopper very short I wished it had lots more bloopers.  Pretty happy.  I watched it twice on tv and dvd is decently close.
Even though some parts were cut out I really enjoyed this dvd. It's very entertaining. I watch it over & over again. My cousins were skeptical about watching it so I told them all they have to do is watch the first side to the 1st dvd & if they didn't like it they didn't have to finish it. But like i knew they loved it & we was up to 5:00 - 6:00am for the next 3nights watching these dvds. Once you start the first dvd you can't stop.
Rub&iacute; es una de mis novelas preferidas y, aunque la edici&oacute;n para dvd no es la mejor, de todas formas me gust&oacute; mucho tenerla y la he visto varias veces.<br /><br />La canci&oacute;n original de la novela no est&aacute; en la edici&oacute;n para el dvd, eso es algo triste pues la canci&oacute;n es muy buena y la del dvd ni se le aproxima.  Tambi&eacute;n tiene un especial de Rub&iacute; pero est&aacute; cortado.<br /><br />Yo le pongo 5 estrellas porque me fascina la historia, tal vez si no me gustara tanto, a &eacute;sta edici&oacute;n del dvd le pondr&iacute;a 3.
The soap opera Rubi started so good, it was so quickly that in every episode you can see something exciting, unfortunately, with the huge succes of the soap opera Televisa ordered more episodes and there's when we had the problem, When we start to see the beginning of the end: the illness of Hector (then alejandro operates him but because of Rubi he let him die accidentaly). Instead of that, magically Hector gets healed, he gets a lover (Yadhira Carrillo), Rubi meet the Count (Manuel Landeta) and Alejandro have a lot of trouble in the hospital because of some fraudulent things. That part of the story is not as cool as the first episodes, they cut A LOT of secondary characters that actually their story wasn't interesting. That's why i think is a very good edition.... EXCEPT: For the music, the main theme (La descarada) was so goood, this new one is pathetic, and the score was also incredible, but especially the song from the dramatic moments. (In the special episode you can hear it in some of the dramatic moments, for example Sonia's death, when Rubi runs to the beach with her wedding dress, when Maribel watch Rubi at the airport with Hector, etc, etc. Instead of that good song they use a very boring theme, it doesn't transmitt the same emotion and tension.<br />Hope we can see a new version of the dvd but with the real music and with more scenes and extras.<br />By the way the extras are very cool, the finale of the original series in black and white, the special of rubi's niece, the press conference of Rubi, the only missed the original trailers (THEY'RE SO COOL, check them out on youtube)
I've loved this soap opera since it came out some years ago. the fact that the main character is a beautiful and evil woman-instead of those poor girls who suffer and suffer eternally, you know, the usual main characters in soaps- caught my attention.<br /><br />Although there are many scenes which don't appear on this 700-minute edition, you can easily understand why Rubi is so evil. I love her, and I love this edition. I would love them to release a full edition, with all the episodes! Barbara Mori is so hot! Every time she's on screen she makes me feel something, even though I'm not straight!
I am hooked.  This is a really good story.  I feel weird because I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps.  Gorgeous latin women!<br /><br />My first Spanish soap was called ROSALINDA and it's awesome too!
it was good though you could tell some parts were missing. Apart from that I spent two straight days watching it and decided it was about time I take some spanish classes
I love this TV novela! Rubi is evil, fun, beautiful. It's a very interesting story and I can say that it surpasses the original soap opera from the 1960s! the actors are incredible. Arturo Santamarina is so handsome! The edit is excellent too, great job!
I was rivited to the screen when I watched Rubi as a telenovela, but missed numerous episodes. When the last one was to be shown, my cable service went out and I called customer service and explained that it was the last episode of Rubi, and the rep totally understood and had it fixed by 8 p.m.  My friends also whispered that they were hooked. So I jumped at the opportunity to order this DVD set. Unfortunatley, it came in a sealed package missing the first disk!  So I didn't see the early episodes and am still at a loss as to how the plot was set up. Nevertheless, Rubi is the Mexican telenovela at its finest. It has all the elements: hot, evil, manipulative beauties (Rubi); sweet, suffering, pious pretty virgins (Maribel); guys easily led by the you-know-whats by hot women (Alejandro); and handsome but sleazy business "socios." You can't keep your eyes off Barbara Mora. She is amazing in this.
My husband watched just for Barbara Mori, the "hottest women on the small screen". I myself am hooked on Spanish Novellas.
Rubi is by far my favorite novela, but I was disappointed to notice that way to many scenes had been edited out of this dvd.  So much so, that at times it's difficult to keep up with what is happening. You will notice this especially if you compare an episode from the dvd with the ones featured on youtube. Of course the main scenes were not cut out, but it's always nice to see what happened prior to the big moments. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this product, but be aware of the many edits.  And if you would like an overview of the soap opera, this is a fair buy.
This spanish soap opera is highly recommended! It brings three dual layered discs. Six sides total. Over 7 hours. Many parts are edited from the soap opera but it is still quite watchable. It also has english subtitles. Some nice extras as well. My biggest gripe all the discs were loose moving freely inside and got scratched alot due to it. Also noticed the audio track raises up and lowers down at times. Might be due to the scratches on the disc.  The discs should be secured better inside the box they came in. Now I have to get an exchange for them. Cause of it.<br />5 stars for Rubi. 2 stars for the scratched discs.
Good "novela", however, wish that it was not so chopped up.  If you did not watch it on Univision, then you would be lost.  I thought I was purchasing the "novela" in its original verision.
Rubi has looks men admire and women envy. Her ambitions are high, but dangerous. She will use her beauty and cunning desire to get whatever she wants. There is of course Alejandro who is the love of her life, but even he is pushed aside as she aims for her dreams of grandeur. Will she ever come to her sense or keep pushing until she falls over?<br /><br />Barbara Mori excels as Rubi and really brings her to life. She makes you hate her and want her at once. The supporting cast too is excellent, but Rubi is the star just like she would like it. One of the better telenovelas recently made, you will be hooked by the first episode.<br /><br />Great stuff!
This is such a great story and when I watched it I got to side 4 and it was SO damaged<br />and scratched that it wouldn't play on any of my DVD players. It was frustrating<br />because all of the other DVD's worked just fine.  Side 3 was also scratched and<br />damaged so badly but for some reason it did play.<br />I wish that I could get a new one without buying it but it's been a while since<br />I purchased it.  I saw it again online and am thinking of buying it again. It's<br />just a shame that I didn't open it right away and watch it so that I could have<br />exchanged it.  I don't remember who the seller is anymore but I wish I did so that<br />I can send them an email asking for a replacement.<br />If you buy this Novela it's great as long as you get good working DVD's.
I am disappointed because of the many cuts they made in comparison to the TV episodes that have been aired.<br />(I am from Germany, and the first few episodes were running on German TV "RTL" but then they were suddenly cancelled, but these episodes that they actually aired were un-cut.)<br /><br />So I bought this DVD to see all of "Rubi". It's a pity it is cut. I'd like the un-cut version. I hope it will be released one day. I cannot get enough of "Rubi", my favourite telenovela.<br /><br />I would have liked Spanish subtitles and German subtitles, in my case. Watch out: English subtitles only on this DVD! And the language the DVD's are in are Spanish.<br /><br />By the way: if you'd like to see Rubi as an uncut version in German language, you can still watch it on "rtlnow" at the moment, too.<br />But it's very expensive, to view all the episodes there. I like Rubi's original voice better than the German synchronization.
Rubi was always my favorite novela, I always caught random episodes on tv and so decided to buy the dvds to make sure I could see the entire series whenever I wanted. I was greatly disappointed when I opened the case and saw only one dvd. I hoped that maybe they had somehow managed to shorten the entire series into one DVD. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The one dvd I got, was amazing, the novela is as good as it wa on tv or maybe even better. I cant find the seller's information to file a complaint, its very disappointing!
THe second cd at the end it was blurry and could not see the end of it.  I probably will return the tape for another one.  I did not know that the cd's were tape on both sides, it was a bit confusing.
This is one of my all time favorite novelas. I'd been looking for it for a while with no luck. When I finally found it here, I was so excited I ordered it right away... I made a mistake, they cut off so much! It seems like they're just a bunch of small clips put together. So dissapointed, I would've definately paid the extra money to get the WHOLE story!
Rubi is severly cut in all duration of the movie. Why do they do this? Want to buy some more telenovelas but am warry. Perhaps when I see a review that people who bought them said NO MORE CUTS! Then will I start buying them again. Sorry. It just makes me so mad!!!
I was so excited to order and recieve this telenovela Rubi. I seen part of it air on tv and hated to see it end. I ordered this for the english subtitles and Im new to telenovelas and Rubi was the first one I had really tried to keep up with. When I received the DVD in the mail and started to watch it I noticed it was very chopped up from editing and some of the parts I really liked and wanted to know what was said was missing. Also I noticed some of the other good actors were not shown much. Rubi is a good telenovela but If you really want to see it and you know your spanish then I would recommend watching it on tv when it airs again or buying the unedited version if there is one out there.
i'm wondering if they ever going to do part 2 where her neice is twice as free spirited and dangerous lol
The DVD was great ... just like watching on TV except no commercials and no repeats of what you'd just seen the day before.
The novela Rubi in itself is excellent.  The theme was fascinating and the actors and actresses were fabulous.  With that said having the opportunity to purchase it and watch it while stationed overseas with no spanish channels is thrilling.  I am no expert in film but thought it was well put together and easy to follow even if some scenes of the TV version were missing.  Definitely a must watch for anyone interested in spanish soaps.
After watching dvd I was a little disapointed. This a good story but when they were editing they missed a lot of the what makes the main character do the things she does. I used to watch the series. When Rubi moved to Cancun there were a lot of real good outdoor shots they cut out. There wasn't enough good shots of surporting characters. I mean were at the beach! I would like the bonus material to be a lot more interesting. I think the production company rushed to get it out. Too bad if the ending was done right their could have been a sequel or two. Barbra Mori is going to be type cast in the future aka Rubi. (what a francise this could have been)
I hardly ever watch television, much less novelas. The only reason why I acquired this DVD was because a friend made a comment to me that made me want this. This is a REMAKE of the 1990 Televisa soap "Teresa", starring the then unknown Mexican beauty SALMA HAYEK. I have not seen this novela in years and was always a fan of it (and still am of Salma Hayek).<br /><br />This is almost the same novela It's amazing how Televisa finds it necessary to re-hash their stories. But when is "Teresa" itself going to be released on DVD??? Do they not release their old soaps so they can rehash them to new audiences? People know the difference, believe me. People knew that "Luz Clarita" was a remake of "Chispita", that "Salome" was a remake of "Colorina" and recently that the novela starring Thalia's niece is a remake of "Rosa Salvaje". Why bother, Televisa? The main difference between "Rubi" and "Teresa" is that Teresa was much more calculative and relied on her tactics to get what she wanted...whilst Rubi relied on her looks and sex to get her way. The endings are different too.<br /><br />But that being said, "Rubi" itself is a decent novela, but Barbara Mori is missing that fire and spark that Salma Hayek brought to the original. Sure she's gorgeous, no denying that. But her role wasn't believable as the calculating and money hungry social climber as she was supposed to be. This role was perfect for Salma and it's a shame this remake couldn't get a similiarly talented star. A pretty face isn't everything<br /><br />I'm just waiting for them to release "Teresa" and all the classic Luc&iacute;a M&eacute;ndez soaps.
It's fine... especially good for sharpening the listening skills of those for whom Spanish is a second language (it even has subtitles!).  Pero, por supuesto, es una telenovela, y como English "soap operas" los contenidos son "trashy."  Pues, si es lo que tienes, bueno.  Que tenga un buen dia!
I had a chance to watch this soap opera on t.v. but I never thought it was interesting..... but now that I noticed I Want the dvd. That's weird, when I had  a chance I decided not to watch it.... but I am most likely going to buy it and see if it's that good.... seems like a interesting soap opera....... I am spanish so I know exactly what they are saying, I love soap opera's in Spanish.. lol<br /><br />  -Thanks for your time =D
I need to buy rubi dvd, and I don't speak spanish so I need one which has english subtitles and I know this one has, but in the features, it says it's only 74 mins and only 1 disc .. so is it really edited that much !! coz I need to see the show .. plz reply if u see this
I did not receive the 3rd double-sided CD for RUBI.... can someone make me a copy and please send it to me???
