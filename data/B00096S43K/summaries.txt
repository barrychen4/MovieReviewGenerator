I really enjoyed it!
Una de mis novelas preferidas !!!
The edition is good, but the music is so boring.
Rubi, so beautiful and yet so evil!
Awesome and she's gorgeous

Rubi, evil & beautiful!
Hot, trashy Mexican soap opera!
Barbara Mori, say no more.
Fair buy, but too many cut out scenes.
Rubi is a pleasant surprise and shouldn't be missed!
Good Soap
Addictive and Dangerous
GREAT NOVELA BUT 1 DVD DIDN'T NOT PLAY. IT ARRIVED DAMAGED!
Cut version and no Spanish subtitles available
