It's hard not to give a movie with Louise Brooks 5 stars, but this just isn't her best vehicle. In fact she only has a supporting role. But anything with Louise's smile is worth watching. If you don't own Pandoria's Box get it first, this is masterpiece. Other Louise Brooks are hard to find but can be worth the effort. Beggar's of Life is a point in example. Nut if you have Pandor's Box get this, it's worth it.
Director Malcolm St. Clair's adaptation of the George Kelly stageplay THE SHOW-OFF is actually a Ford Sterling vehicle, despite cover art depicting Louise Brooks, who here portrays the girlfriend of a secondary character.<br /><br />Sterling is best known as Chief of Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops. In this story he's the bragadocious J. Aubrey Piper, a carnation-wearing railroad clerk claiming to be a wealthy company big shot. Aubrey proposes to Amy Fisher (Wilson), which displeases her parents who are little-impressed with him, as they've been told the truth about their future son-in-law's lowly position and net worth. The two marry anyway, and spendthrift Aubrey is unable to support his bride on a clerk's pay.<br /><br />After he wins a car in a raffle, Aubrey (who doesn't know how to operate it) causes several accidents by driving on the wrong side of the road. In the process of crashing the auto, Aubrey pins a traffic cop against a wall. In court he's unable to pay a $1,000 fine, so his brother Joe (Kelly) helps out, which causes a whole new set of problems.<br /><br />In 1946, Red Skelton starred in one of the many remakes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630294659X">THE SHOW OFF</a> (1946).
