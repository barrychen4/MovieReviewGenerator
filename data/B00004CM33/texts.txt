This old TV special is made up from 10 cartoons, using only about 3 minutes of that cartoon.  It would have gotten 5 stars if the cartoons were complete.<br /><br />For some unexplained reason the Easter Bunny calls Granny to tell her that he is sick & unable to distribute Easter Eggs.  Granny thinks Bugs Bunny would be a good substitute, so she goes down to the Warner Brothers Studio where Bugs is filming 3 minute segments to complete his cartoons.  Here she must sit through the various filmings & screenings of Looney Tunes Cartoon segments to try to talk to Bugs.<br />The new animation is pretty poor & Mel's vocal work is weak (well he is older).  It is hard to realize that this poor material was produced & directed by veteran Looney Toonists FRIZ FRELENG & BOB McKIMSON.<br /><br />Oh, and since this was for the kiddies, all gunshots by Elmer Fudd have been edited out of the TV Special. (NOT by Warner for the DVD.)<br /><br />Cartoon clips used from:<br />1) Knighty Knight Bugs<br />2) Hillbilly Hare<br />3) Bully for Bugs<br />4) Tweety's Circus (Tweety & Sylvester)<br />5) Birds Anonymous (Tweety & Sylvester)<br />6) For Scent-Imental Reasons (Pepe Le Pew)<br />7) Rabbit Of Seville<br />8) Foghorn Leghorn cartoon<br />9) Robin Hood Daffy (Daffy & Porky) *almost complete, only the ending has been removed to segway back to the new animation.*<br />10) Sahara Hare<br /><br />BONUS COMPLETE CARTOON:<br />HIS HARE RAISING TALE - basically a clip-show cartoon in which Bugs tells his nephew about his various adventures in 8 minutes, this means very short clips.<br /><br />So unless you want to collect everything Looney Tunes, wait for this April's real Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duck cartoon collections to come out with complete cartoons.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033XKVEG">Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinaire (Looney Tunes Super Stars)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033XKV96">Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl (Looney Tunes Super Stars)</a><br /><br />On a positive note: June Foray gets screen credit for voicing Granny, something she was usually overlooked for in the voice credits (but we knew it was her).
This movie was not what I expected.  I was looking for nostalgia, instead I got different scenes from bugs bunny shows, all of which had nothing to with Easter.  Save your money and do a search on youtube.
I was glad to see this on dvd.  Needed to upgrade the vhs.  I love all the characters in their short stories.  A real collectors' item.
