This was my absolute favorite movie when I was a child.  I haven't seen it in years, though I know I have a worn out tape of it somewhere.  I remember the cheetah was adorable and the story, while possibly being typical Disney fluff, was heartwarming.  I'd definitely recommend it as a gift for any child who loves animals.
It brought back so many fond memories to watch a great Disney classic, I was so excited to share this movie with  my son. He also loved it, and it has now become a favorite of his. I would recommend this movie for a wonderful family movie night.
This movie is a good old fashioned disney movie, clear cut good guy fighting the bad guy. Though the best film to relate this film to would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000633U5">White Fang</a>. Pretty much the same story, including the heart felt, get out of my life speech to the cheetah. Yet, still a good enough movie to want to own.
If you're looking for the Anamorphic Widescreen version of this movie you'll need to buy the Region 2 UK version at Amazon.co.uk or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001KZNGK">Cheetah</a><br /><br />The aspect ratio of this movie is 1.85:1 and looks GREAT on a widescreen TV!<br /><br />But you will need to have a multi region DVD player to play this Region 2 DVD.
I remember seeing this in the movies when i was in my early teens. My brother, was newly married, and he used to take me to the movies quite a bit. We went to see this gem. It has a gripping plot, lots of animals, and what it doesn't have is the sex/violence/foul language that many movies inundate us with.<br /><br />The plot was already mentioned by several reviewers, but all i want to add is that movies like this show that good clean entertainment CAN be made without being "boring"<br /><br />Enjoy!
It's a really good family movie!  Being a lifetime lover of African landscapes, it allows me to escape city life, but monetary greed still keeps me there. It's nice to know that people still live in old-fashioned ways - and have old-fashioned values!
I grew up watching this movie and was so excited to see it on here.  Having said that, I realized while watching it that I loved it so much because I was a child and it's a good, clean adventure story.  As an actual movie it's not all that great but if you have kids they will probably love it :)
Cheetah is a wonderful family movie filled with fun and adventure.  The scenery of Africa is amazing and the animals are beautiful!  A movie you don't want to miss!!!!
Cheetah is one of those movies that I wore the tape out on as a kid. It tugged my heartstrings with the poachers and racing schemes. But it also made me smile when I was shown that people *did* care about animals.<br /><br />I was 8 when it first came out, and my mom made sure I had a copy the moment the tape came out. I played it all the time, along with The Last Unicorn, Labyrinth, and the old Shaggy Dog movies. She had to replace copies every so often, especially after a hurricane decimated my collection.<br /><br />I'm so glad I have the chance to own this movie again. It makes finals week much easier to bear.
I saw this movie when I was a kid, when I saw it again a bought straight away !!!!! It a great movie about friendship and Cheetahs..
We had bought a similar movie, Duma, which my family absolutely loved and thought this might be similar.  Watching Cheetah was a total 80s flashback--I had no idea this movie was out in the 80s but now that makes total sense given the wardrobe, the tube socks, the hair, etc.  I had assumed that it had been shelved way back when and was brought out because of the success of Duma.  The movie is enjoyable for a once-through.  Duma is MUCH better.
Africa is Alive! In many films the native life and the wildlife of Africa is displayed as part of the movie, and "Cheetah" is no exception. "Cheetah" tells the story of a boy named Ted and a girl named Susan who take a vacation in Africa, because of their father's job. Running approximately 83 minutes long, this Walt Disney production, which was made in 1989 and is centered in Kenya, shows some parts of Africa. This movie is based on the book, "The Cheetah's" written by Alan Caillou. Since this film has been rated "G" it can be enjoyed by children of all ages, and be watched by the grown-up members of the family. Certainly this movie is a unique wildlife epic. "Cheetah" is an adventure!<br /><br />As is already known, "Cheetah" is set in Kenya Africa. The time that the story is set in is modern times (or modern times back in 1989). The leitmotif of this movie is a cheetah. In the beginning of the movie Ted and Susan are disappointed because they are not aloud to explore the surrounding African wild. They are excited because they are in Africa but saddened that they do not get to see any of it. Finally, however, Ted and Susan find something to liven up their trip. They find a baby Cheetah. A poacher had killed the baby duma's mother (duma is in the native word for cheetah), and Ted and Susan decide to keep her. They named her Duma. Duma grows and grows. She becomes very docile. Growing sad as the time draws near for their departure, Ted and Susan have to say goodbye to Morogo, a native friend who they had met. They will probably never see him or Duma again. Like most movies, the tension in "Cheetah" builds up as it progresses, and as is also the case with other movies, the central characters in "Cheetah" get into tight situations as they have adventures in Africa.<br /><br />At the beginning of the exciting part, (which is) closer to the end of the movie, Ted and Susan, because they are leaving, have to decide what to do with the cheetah. Should they give the cheetah to a zoo or should they let her go free, into the wild? Duma had forgotten how to hunt, and, in fact, how to be a cheetah, but Ted and Susan decide to release her into the wild. They try to train her. Sneaking into Ted's and Susan's house, snooping around and stealing Duma, Mr. Patel, the local store owner, and two other men, including the ignominious, and deus ex machina poacher, want the cheetah to run in a race of the prolific sport of racing cheetahs against gray hounds. Ted and Susan make an un-astute choice, and go looking for the cheetah by themselves. Only the brave Morogo who coolly and diligently acts as guide through their journey accompanies them. As they make their way through Kenya, They suffer from want of food and water. Ultimately, however, they find the poachers headquarters, where Duma is being trained for the race. At night, they attempt to rescue their beloved cheetah, however, even though they have found Duma, she is not out of the poacher's hands yet.<br /><br />Unfortunately right when Ted and Susan find Duma, they are caught, put in a cage and left while the evil men start for the race. They somehow escaped. Ted, Susan and Morogo, all began traveling to the location of the race, only to be caught by the searching policemen roaming the roads for them. While at a gas station, they again escape because of the inattentiveness of the policeman, and finally make it to their destination. Sadly, they arrived too late too stop the race but surprisingly Duma, who had fallen behind, put on a burst of speed and triumphantly wins the race. Ted and Susan were able to get their tamed cheetah back, but then they face a choice, either to keep Duma for the few weeks that remained of their stay, or to let her go free and never see her again. Since the ending denouement will not be divulged in this critique, all that can be said is that Ted and Susan made the right choice.<br /><br />"Cheetah" is a good movie for a quiet evening in which every one wants good entertainment. Cleverly and unnoticeably intertwined within this film, like a large, green, grape vine on a trellis, are several morals, and one, which is as popular as Elvis, because of its invaluable lesson, is "evil never prospers". Although this movie is good there is one fault; Ted does not act his age. Besides the one mistake, the movie "Cheetah" is a very good one.
Incredibly bad. 90% of the (very brief) animal scenes weren't even filmed on the same film stock as the rest of the movie! Every time they cut to an animal, suddenly the picture gets all grainy. Can you say, "Stock Footage"? After seeing this turkey you will.<br /><br />Absolutely typical Disney gotta-have-a-villain story, only watered down beyond belief. This thing doesn't play like a made-for-Disney-Channel quickie, it plays like a BAD made-for-Disney-Channel quickie. If you love your children, don't buy this thing.<br /><br />If you want to see how the same basic story can be done better without the need for a Disney villian, have a look at the movie "Duma". (Which isn't a great movie, but anything's better than Disney's "Cheetah".)
This is a good film! Well to be honest I cant actually remember what happens, been a long time since i watched it! But my uncle is in it, so I have to say it's good dont i! :) Of what I can remember it was good, and I am not easy to satisfy at all! So buy it and see!
