Before CGI, one of the last intriguing alien films out there
I remember
Christophen Walken gets an anal probe.
Very Interesting similarities.
No matter what you think of the film
Did it really happen?
communion dvd
This World Is Nothing Like You Think It Is
Communion (Special Collector's Edition) (1989)-Just OK.
Worth Buying. based on a real incident.
Communion
Not bad....
Not Very Coherent, But Very Unsettling
Walken Makes This Movie Barely Worth It
Leave the lights on at bedtime after watching this.
Weirdest movie ever
Horrendous Letdown
Yuck!
