One of the most funny movies ever. Every time you watch it, you find new things to enjoy. John Cleese is excellent as the typical English lawyer, who is dying to break out of harness of Englishness, Jamie Lee Curtis is the most sexy gangster girl ever and Kevin Kline is the most cliche American hitman you can imagine. There are numberous brilliant and classic scenes, varying from John Cleese who is being disturbed while stripping and spreaking Russianby the new owners of a house he has hired from a friend to Jamie Lee Curtis explaining to the ultra-stupid Kevin Kline that the London Underground is NOT a political movement. And you also learn how to torture a person using only French fries and a pear. So watch it, enjoy it and laugh yourself to pieces.
'A Fish Called Wanda' accomplishes what many have not. A comedy with a rediculous premise, made believable by the casting.  John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and thier supporting actors are terrific.  Just enough Monty Python.
This is by far the funniest movie I've ever seen. If you don't find this  movie to be &quot;sinfully funny&quot; you don't have a sense of  humor!<p>Kevin Kline pulled off one of the greatest movie performances of  all-time. He definately deserved his Oscar award for his role as  &quot;Don't Call Me Stupid&quot; Otto.<p>John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis  &amp; Michael Palin were magnificent.<p>Even animal lovers will laugh  hysterically at Palin's attempts to &quot;rub out&quot; Cleese's  witness!<p>This movie had so many great zingers (i.e. &quot;I killed for  the C.I.A.!), you'll find yourself laughing 10 years from now just thinking  about &quot;Wanda&quot;.<p>If you haven't seen it yet....what are you  waiting for?
I have seen this movie in VHS, Beta, and now on DVD.  I found it to be an excellent transfer of a supremely funny movie. My only regret is there were no SPECIAL features. Hence 4 stars instead of 5
John Cleese was not my favorite member of Monty Python, but he certainly has done the best work since. His wit and slapstick made Faulty Towers a must have. With &quot;Fish&quot; he showed Hollywood he could transfer that  brilliance to the big screen. Cleese stays in the background in this one  allowing most of the big laughs to go to Kline and Palin. There is enough  here for everyone with some slapstick , romantic comedy, and politically  incorectness thrown into this &quot;who gets the girl, who gets the  loot&quot; farce.  Oh, by the way, watching Jamie Lee get all warm and  fuzzy a couple times doesn't hurt none either :)
I laughed until I almost fell out my seat. Its fun to watch a movie when you know the actors are having a good time making a picture. If nothing else watch Kevin Kline in his Academy award winning role that he deserved  hands down.
John Cleese and Michael Palin may be most famous for their Monty Python troupe, Jamie Lee Curtis for Halloween, and Kevin Kline for...being in movies, but one of their most memorable movies is the first one they did together. Which one? A Fish Called Wanda<p>Curtis is Wanda, part of a diamond group along with Ken (Palin), George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), and her "brother" Otto (Kline). They pull off a multi-million pound heist in England, and hide the loot. It seems, though, that Wanda and Otto (who aren't actually brother and sister but lovers) want it all for themselves. So they turn George into the police to try to find out where he hid the loot. It seems the only person George would have told about where the loot is would be his barrister Archie Leach (Cleese). So, naturally, Wanda goes up to him and becomes `friends' with him, much to the dismay of Otto.<p>A Fish Called Wanda is a twistful and delightful comedy that shows the new sex comedies that they don't need gross body functions to be funny. I'm not saying this movie is completely tasteful. Ken, who is an animal lover, accidentally kills dogs. But, it's not too explicit. It's actually very funny.<p>Most of the humor comes from Kline, who always shows up whenever Archie and Wanda are together, and who pretends he's gay and tries to get Ken. Some of those subplots, such as the gay one and Kline hating people that call him stupid, seem to not matter. But it is funny. Cleese's script is full of surprises. And most of these laughs were genuine, unlike the fakey ones from other movies. Who can forget Kline's shout whenever he's in the car? It is a memorable movie.<p>Kline puts up his best comedic performance, and deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. He has excellent comedic timing, always putting the joke on at the right time. He had great chemistry with everyone; it seemed to blend in with the lifestyles of the others. Curtis (one of my favorite actresses)was excellent in a comedic role. Of course, Cleese and Palin are no strangers to comedy. Cleese seemed like a typical British person-stuck up and courteous. He actually talks about that during the film. Palin was great with a stutter that actually is an important part of the film.<p>It seems that A Fish Called Wanda thinks itself as `bad' and `let's offend everyone!' However, it's one of the more tasteful comedies I've seen recently. Its jokes are almost always funny and tasteful, with Kline's trigger-happy attitude that explodes every once in a while. This group, that came back for 1997's Fierce Creatures, were excellent and they look like they had fun together. Which is good for them. However, after the first forty minutes or so, the humor kind of wavers and it becomes a little uneven. There are still jokes, of course, but not as rapid-fire as the ones before. But considering the humor of the film in its entirety, it could be considered a moot point.<p>A Fish Called Wanda is a very hilarious comedy that you'll remember for a while, and looks like it can stick up for repeated viewings, because there are so many jokes you'll forget a lot of them.
This classic 1988 British comedy, which was written by and stars John Cleese (Fawlty Towers, Monty Python), has got to be one of the funniest films of all time, and it is certainly one of my favourites.  <p>Briefly, the story involves four criminals who steal a fortune in diamonds.  One ends up in prison (having been ratted on by two of his not-so-loyal mates); ironically, just prior to his arrest he had secretly taken the jewels and rehidden them.  So the film revolves around the attempts of the others to discover the location of the jewels.  <p>The plot is indeed a good one, but what really makes this film exceptional and so hilarious is the colourful cast of characters and the splendid performances of all involved.  There simply isn't one weak performance here.  <p>The central character is a beautiful and spirited American woman named Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), the lone female in the gang and the only intelligent one of the lot.  Wanda's one weakness, however, is her penchant for hearing foreign languages--it's something that really turns her on!  This makes for much hilarity between her and her fellow gangster, Otto (whom Wanda has been trying to pass off as her brother), as Otto rattles off every known Italian food dish, type of cheese, and so on, in his attempts to seduce Wanda.  Otto (Kevin Kline), by the way, is a highly paranoid, Nietzsche-reading yet empty-headed, Anglophobic, trigger-happy lunatic who thinks he's an intellectual and enjoys sniffing his armpits.  He's a flamboyant personality to say the least, and one which Kline manages to carry off wonderfully--I simply cannot imagine anyone doing a better job.  These two are the real powerhouses of the gang.  <p>Then there's poor Ken (Michael Palin (Monty Python)), who's an avid animal lover--a fact which provides the basis for some extremely funny scenes.  He's a humorously pathetic character--a little bit on the simple side with the worst stammer ever, and if  there's a show-stealer (and I say "if" for they're all so good), for me it's Ken.  He's simply hilarious, and the interplay between him and the nasty Otto is simply priceless.  (It's a bit like watching a cat relentlessly toying with a poor, helpless little mouse).  Lastly, one mustn't forget John Cleese, who portrays Archie, the rather reserved barrister representing George, the incarcerated gang member, and who, I just have to add, has Wanda in a fit of ecstasy (unbeknownst to himself) in one hilarious scene when he starts spouting Russian.  <p>In conclusion, the film (which has a running time of 108 minutes) is definitely a must-see for fans of British comedy or, for that matter, for anyone looking for a thoroughly entertaining not to mention hilarious film.  I've seen it a number of times and certainly don't regret purchasing it.  It's definitely one to watch and rewatch.  And if you've enjoyed the film, by all means check out Fawlty Towers (also co-written by and starring John Cleese and also featuring an abundance of visual humour).  You'll not regret it--it's simply one of the funniest shows ever made.  And so is this film!<p>Very highly recommended!
I knew there was a reason I had always avoided seeing this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is the only entertaining actor in this very mediocre movie. It's just too ridiculous to keep your attention from the very beginning in my opinion.  It has a very poor plot and really centers around Jamie Lee Curtis' character using her body to get her way and men who drop 50 IQ points around her.  I hated it, but obviously at 4.5 stars, a lot of people love silly movies that go nowhere. To each their own. If you are a fan of the actors in the movie, most likely, you will like it.
This is serious comedy, that grows on you, but is well off the edge of seriousness.<br /><br />Kevin Kline, as Jamie Lee Curtis' lover, clearly relishes his role as a faux incestuous paranoid.  A diamond heist is what brings this cast of misfits together in a plot that gets zanier as it develops.<br /><br />As they each try to out fox the other, a romantic quadrangle develops that ends with an unexpected twist. That's all I can comprehend of this movie in an orderly and coherent fashion.<br /><br />I love this movie and wish I had the words to say why, but I don't. Five stars!
A Fish Called Wanda is a delightful little comedy about a heist-gone-right-gone-wrong.<br /><br />It seems that there's very little honor among thieves, when four crooks can't follow the get-away plan they'd concocted because they're too busy trying to screw each other out of the loot. We follow them as they plot, and counter-plot against one another, leading to what is possibly the most hilarious torture scene ever filmed, and a number of awkward, aborted attempts at adultery.<br /><br />The question finally becomes: who is so low that they'll manage to out-con the others? And to answer that, you need to watch the movie.<br /><br />Fun, funny, and not showing age one bit. Four stars.
I got into Monty Python sometime around last year. I became sort of obsessed and I plan to someday see every movie and book that any of them made. A Fish Called Wanda was one of the movies I had to see. We rented it and I must have watched it 4 times in the first week of having it! Michael has always been one of  my favorite Pythons, but I knew John first because of Fawlty Towers that I watched with my sister on Comedy Central. Apart from the Monty Python movies, this has to be my favorite! I think they all did a great job on it! Next to see: Fierce Creatures.
I've loved this movie for years.  It always cheers me up.  Kevin Kline<br />won a best supporting oscar for this movie.  He is a psuedo intellectual<br />who is jealous of Jamie Lee Curtis's characters crush on John Cleese.<br />Between Kline driving on the wrong side of the road and being a complete idiot.  You will soon discover why this movie is a gem.<br /><br />Kim Rivest
A great and funny film.....had to have the latest version and all the extras.  Great fun and classic film comedy.
Kevin Cline at his best.  I just love this movie for a host of reasons. For anyone that loved the Monty Python humour.  John Clesse is great and so is Michael Palin.  Just loved this film.
Although I haven't been able to watch my newest DVD... it arrived quickly and was packaged nicely (don't ya just love 'bubble envelopes'?)! Thanks Amazon!
Here is a movie that entertains as a movie should instead of<br /><br />instilling messages
This review is only for the disc, not the movie.<br /><br />I bought this DVD back in 2009 and left it sitting unopened on a shelf with my other DVDs. Last night I finally opened the package for the first time and tried to watch it and the disc wouldn't even play. Started stuttering in the opening scene and never got better. After 5 minutes of the movie stuttering and jumping around I finally turned it off. Very aggravating.<br /><br />Thinking it might be the DVD player I got out my old DVD player that I'd recently replaced with a blu ray player and tried to play it on that one as well with the same result.<br /><br />Bottom line, the disk is defective/poor quality. Seeing as I bought this 2 years ago I'm not very confident that Amazon would even consider replacing it so I'm just going to have to eat the loss.<br /><br />Can't recommend this product at all. I'd give it zero stars if possible.
I have always thought this film was very funny.  Basically the end of Jamie Lee Curtis & Kevin Kline's careers.  NEVER had another hit film either of them.<br /><br />This is a film that needed an updated DVD package.  No extras at all.  Won an Oscar for Kline & was a hit but this package has NO extras.  Glad a n updated DVD package is always available.<br /><br />"Don't call me stupid".<br /><br />My rating is for the film not for the bare nothing special DVD package.<br />Extras, where are the extras?<br /><br />I never liked Palin's character Ken.<br /><br />Does have both wide screen & stand versions of the film depending on what you prefer.<br /><br />Does have a good brochure with film information plus chapter search list.
I am one of those who HATED the whole late night British invasion of late 70s TV, led by Benny Hill and of course Monty Python's Flying Circus. It was inane and droll. Even after a nearly a century, Charlie Chaplin is still cutting edge as far as British humor goes. That's what makes this movie such a delightful surprise. Just like in ARTHUR, British humor is fully realized when Americanized--just like Black humor is best when written by Jews--- and this, combined with John Cleeves's finsest hour, makes this a comedic classic that can go yuk for yuk with any flick!
I know I will get lots of "unhelpful" votes for this, but I must say that this comedy did not work for me.  The characters are exaggerated, even offensive (well, not PC), and the situations are utterly outlandish if not grotesque (e.g. eating the neurotic stutterer's fish right out of the acquarium).  OK, the actors are all extremely good.  Alas, taken together, I just felt like I was wasting my time watching this, like it was too silly to believe.  What I mean is, it didn't click, my laughs were forced and rare, and I couldn't suspend my disbelief, but instead constantly felt like someone was making this up as they went along.<br /><br />Not recommended.
This movie is, in a word, hilarious. I defy anyone to watch it and not have tears streaming down their face from laughter. It's one of those classic, uproariously insane comedies in the Monty Python style, just plain crazy funny. I am an animal lover but even the part where the poodles that get annihilated was hilarious and Michael Palin's reactions to that are beyond funny.  This is one movie that is guaranteed to make you scream with laughter.  I have seen it about a dozen times and it still makes me laugh till I cry.
Well, after Python, John Cleese and Michael Palin decided to go more into 'serious' comedy with this film, A Fish Named Wanda.  The story is about a group of four who successfully steal some diamonds, but then, as all good burglars do, turn against each other only to fall into complication upon complication.<br /><br />The film has a decent amount of big names, such as Kevin Kline, John Cleese, and Jamie Lee Curtis.  However, I just never really got into this.  The plot is well twisted so that is not the problem; however, I just lack the interest in the characters.<br /><br />First of all, Michael Palin is just going off of the stuttering bit he did in Life of Brian. Moreover, and I never understood how anyone could be, every male character is heads over heels for Curtis, which just seems so unrealistic to me even in a plot.  Really though, the 'comedy' just was not that funny, except for a bit of semi-absurdity near the end.<br /><br />Thus, I would advise a different movie.  I do not really know which one, but particularly something different.
Despite a couple of funny scenes (just funny, not really hilarious), this movie is average at best and highly disappointing. Some might say that &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; is a masterpiece comedy, but frankly I fail to see what the hype is all about. Sure, there are a couple of quirky moments here, yet the plot is substandart, the directing is weak, the characters are not likable in the least and the acting shows signs of competence still isn`t all that great either. Overall, this effort is a mildly enjoyable cinematic experience that`s probably worth watching once if there`s nothing better around. Decent and tolerable, but a classic this is not.<p>Passable entertainment.
Comedies don't normally age well because there are only so many times you can hear a joke without getting sick of it and so films of that ilk normally represent sort of a time capsule of what the key events and issues of the time were that concerned people and hence what was funny to them at that time.  For those of us that are not of that time dated jokes leave us asking "huh?".<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film falls into that category and while there are a few scenes especially between Palin and Cleese that drew a smile from me in remembrance of the great Python days the rest of the film was desperately dated and had me looking at the clock wishing it would end.  1988 must also have been a very bad year for films as that would explain how Kline could win his Oscar.  Cleese is a funny actor but he is certainly not a scriptwriter.  From the opening credits that were in an off-putting deep blue to the horrible score and background music this film doesn't even begin well.  Highly overrated and a film that ages very, very poorly it isn't helped by this very poor dvd version with horrible mono sound quality and even worse picture quality that is full of white spots and other imperfections.  There are no special features to speak about like interviews or making-of documentaries as well.<br /><br />It's actually embarassing that Cleese and Palin could actually put their names to this film given the vastly superior output that they were involved in from their Python days.<br /><br />Avoid at all cost!
I loved Kevin Kline in "Dave" and Jamie Lee Curtis in "Trading Places", so I sadly wasted my time and money on this vulgar and silly garbage.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!
My girlfriend really wanted me to see this movie.  She kept telling me how  hilarious it was.  We finally rented it and, about a half hour into it, I  turned to her and asked, &quot;When does it get funny?&quot;  Seriously.  I  saw nothing funny about the whole beginning of the movie.  About an hour  into it, we finally get to a scene that made me laugh.  There were a few  others after that, but not many.<p>Not only wasn't the movie funny, it  wasn't very well done, either.  The movie starts with these people planning  a burglary.  Then the burglary occurs and the so-called hijinks begin.  Who  are these people?  Why are they robbing this bank?  We get no background on  these characters, how they met, or what their relationships are to each  other.  That might have helped.<p>Finally, what's up with the title?  What  does robbing a bank have to do with the fact that one of the guys has a  fish with the same name as Jamie Lee Curtis' character?  I don't get  it.<p>If you're looking for a good crook comedy, check out DIRTY ROTTEN  SCOUNDRELS instead.  This one was a big disappointment.
This review refers to the 1998 DVD edition of "A Fish Called Wanda"(MGM)<br /><br />"A Fish Called Wanda" is a fabulous romp with a group of jewel thieves, of which the term "honor among thieves" has no meaning!<br />At every turn, they are scheming and manipulating the events, as each wants the loot for themselves. The most scheming and manipulating of all is the lone woman of the bunch, who is also the weak spot for all the fellows. Wanda, played impeccably by Jaime Lee Curtis, has these guys falling over themselves trying to get the loot and the girl! Kevin Kline, John Cleese(who also penned the screenplay)and Michael Palin, will have you in stitches with each and every view. Every time I view it I see or hear some little detail or subtlety I didnt get previously.<br /><br />Nearly 20 years later(yes fans, it's been that long), this film has not lost one bit of it's appeal for those of us that like our humor a little on the bawdy side(Although all in good fun).<br /><br />But!...Give me a break MGM. This DVD is quite shabby considering the loyal fans this film has.This DVD does have a couple of things going for it. It has the choice of widescreen viewing or standard, has English, and French subtitles, for those who may need them, and includes a booklet with production notes and trivia. Also, the menu page was cute. If you click on the little treasure chest in the aquarium, the screen becomes just the "Wanda" fish swimming around with sound effects. However... as another reviewer mentioned the picture is below average. It does not live up to the reason why we don't mind paying a little extra for a DVD vs a VHS. The sound is in MONO..what's up with that? This film is deserving of at least stereo sound.<br /><br />And as usual, after all of us have already purchased this now classic comedy, MGM is coming up with a new "Deluxe" edition, that is more along the lines of what is expected of a DVD.(Talk about double dipping!)It is a 2 disc edition and shows these features:<br />"Audio Commentary with Actor/Writer John Cleese<br />Over 25 minutes of Deleted and Alternate Scenes<br />John Cleese's First Farewell Performance<br />Something's Fishy Making-of Documentary<br />Easter Eggs, Previews, and More!"<br /><br />It is available for pre-order(but doesn't list the sound available yet)The ASIN for that site is B000E33W1C.<br /><br />5 stars for a film that never gets old. 3 stars to MGM for making us wait this long for a decent view.<br /><br />Still laughing after all these years...Laurie<br /><br />fans of the very talented Kevin Kline may also enjoy:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CEC0">The Ice Storm</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056BSJ">Grand Canyon</a><br />see my reviews for film details - both are fabulous
Starting with the commonplace idea of a jewel robbery gone maniacally wrong, actor John Cleese and director Charles Crichton manage have created a madcap comedy that remains fresh, even after 10 years.  George (Tom Georgeson), assisted by his girlfriend Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), his best pal Ken (Michael Palin) and Wanda's 'brother' Otto (Kevin Kline) has orchestrated a robbery that has only one fatal flaw - none of the participants have any intention of sharing the loot.  In short order, double-crosses seem to grow on trees and George finds himself under arrest.  It is only fitting that Wanda and Otto simultaneously discover that the jewels have been moved 'for safekeeping.'<p>It doesn't take very long for Wanda to figure out that her only hope of regaining the loot is through George's barrister, Archie Leach (John Cleese).  Wanda works at seducing Leach while fighting of Otto's psychotic fits of jealousy.  Ken, in the meantime, attempts repeatedly to kill the only witness, an elderly woman.  Unfortunately, he manages to assassinate all three of her dogs in the process.<p>This is a set up for the combination of slapstick, vulgarity, and tongue-in-cheek comedy that British films are noted for and Americans love and it is delivered with an almost evil verve.  Cleese is determined to take no prisoners, and the landscape is littered with car crashes, fallen masonry, savaged canines (fake savaged canines, please) and hapless victims.  Only the fish (also called Wanda) has no funny lines, and fares no better than her companion 'Lunch' does.<p>The film has an R rating, which I think is exaggerated.  In reality, its vulgarity and sexual innuendo are hardly noticeable when compared to what is accepted today.  I certainly think teenagers can handle it without permanent damage, although you may have to explain to them that certain phrases don't bear repeating.  At this price, expect a bare bones DVD.  No added games, no interviews, just the film in French and English, in both wide screen and standard presentations.  Even so, this is a classic comedy that will bear much watching.
NOTE: This review is about the 1998 version of the DVD. Newer releases may be better quality.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />This film is definitely on my top ten list of funniest movies of all time, with "Some Like it Hot," "National Lampoons Christmas Vacation" and the Monty Python masterpieces...<br /><br />But this DVD is atrocious. The soundtrack is all in the center channel... haven't heard anything worse since I gave up watching a TV with a 3 inch speaker. The theme song is burbled and warbly. There is no separation -- even to the front speakers. The dialog is flat as a flitter.<br /><br />The picture quality is a hair better than off the air, rabbit ear antennae reception. At times the picture is choppy and halting -- as if you were watching it on a rental video that has been viewed too many times.<br /><br />The only extra is the film's trailer.<br /><br />Wait for a re-release before buying!
I love the movie &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;.  It is one of my all time favorite movies.  If you haven't seen it, go rent/buy it - there is no better time to see it, now that it is on DVD!<p>Therefore, this is a review  of the DVD - not the movie.  The DVD has a very good presentation of the  movie - the best you can watch at home (as mentioned above).  However, the  sound is lacking - dull mono.  Maybe this movie was originally recorded in  mono, but I would be surprised.<p>Next there is the lack of extras - you  get the trailer and &quot;cast notes&quot; but virtually nothing else...  just a dumb fish screen saver.<p>I don't mean to be so down on this DVD, it  isn't terrible, it is just a disappointment to think of all of the  unrealized potential.  First of all, there is the sound.  Then, there was  no behind the scenes featurette, no comentaries, no deleted scenes,  nothing.  With Kline, Cleese, Palin and Curtis in the cast, there could  have been all kinds of killer extras.  But there wasn't...<p>At this point  I would give this DVD 3 stars.  However, it earns an extra star because MGM  bowed to pressure and put it out in Widescreen.  They originally planned on  P&amp;S only.<p>So thanks a lot, MGM, but now get busy on a  &quot;Collectors Edition&quot;.<p>Jeremy
The movie is in great shape, and the extras are worth the money.  The cast interviews were quite revealing.  Jamie Lee tells who she thinks the best kisser was among Kline, Palin, and Cleese. And you find out if Cleese really was hung out a window or if it was just special effects.  Cleese's running commentary was worth sitting through, even for me, and I usually hate those things.  The deleted scenes weren't very interesting--just shots, really, not even full scenes.  Overall, though, I'm very glad I bought it!
Classic comedy indeed,starring John Cleese,Jamie Lee Curtis,Michael Palin,and Kevin Kline in a Oscar winning role!!! This great 2-DVD set has a great transfer of the film and a fishbowl(pun intended)of great extras that this classic comedy deserves,it blows the original DVD release out of the water(again pun inteneded)!!! If you like this great comedy gem,then this 2 DVD set is the way to go!!! Very recommended!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+
Michael Palin is the anti-PC, stuttering, animal rights activist, thief, and doggie hitman.<p>Jamie Lee Curtis is sexy (of course), devious, loveable, and a manipulation mastermind.<p>John Cleese is, well, John Cleese.<p>Kevin Kline won an Oscar for his work as a philosophy-reading/mangling, live-fish-eating, ex-CIA thug named Otto.<p>There's a plot involving stolen diamonds and plane tickets to Rio, but, really -- who cares? The joy is in watching four brilliant comic actors, who all obviously enjoy working with one another.<p>The joy, and the laughs, are infectious. Quite simply, "A Fish Called Wanda" is the funniest movie of the last 25 years.
When I saw A FISH CALLED WANDA in the theater back in the late '80s, the only thing that prevented me from staying for another viewing was the ache in my gut from laughing so hard. So, the next day, I coughed up another $4.00(!) just to see it again (remember when going to the movies didn't cost a friggin fortune?). Having this dvd permits me to laugh whenever I'm down or grumpy. Cleese, Curtis, Kline and Palin (with the world's funniest hair-do ever) just worked so well together. The direction was well-paced considering the several subplots. And the transfer from video to dvd is crisp and clear. I know everyone else (with any sense of humor) reviewing this movie is lavishing the same praise but I don't mind repeating them. This is a band wagon worth jumping on.
Excellent comedies that really work are so very few and far between, but this beauty ranks among the best ever!  Never before has John Cleese thrown so much humanity into a character; when he's smitten with Jamie Lee Curtis'  character, he is absolutely head over heels in love, and it shows, and even  more, it's believable!  His character goes through and exhibits the full  range of human emotions, and Cleese pulls it off masterfully.  Kevin Kline  is at the top of his game in this one--never again will I ever call anyone  &quot;stupid,&quot; lest they react like Kline's character does!  Really  one of this country's most under-rated actors (despite the Best Supporting  Actor Oscar for this movie).  And not to be left out, Jamie Lee Curtis and  Michael Palin are SO perfect for their roles--what a riot!  Palin's  character in particular is a real study in bodily disintegration!  No  offense to dog lovers, but Palin's reaction to his attempts at knocking-off  the elderly witness that actually results in the reduction of her band of  pets is comedy at it's finest!  Hilarious and touching all at the same  time, Wanda is a rare gem among recent movies; excellent cast, great  characters, hilarious story line, and dead-on dialogue.  You'll be  snickering long after it's over.  And never again will you look at  fishtanks, fish and chips, or old ladies out walking their little dogs, the  same!  Watch it and you'll completely understand!
I don't know a funnier movie, and certainly no other one that gets better after the fifth time.<br />Kevin Kline is the greatest, I didn't even know him as a clown before. From John Cleese we wouldn't have expected anything else. Don't forget Wanda, of course. I mean the fish.<br />Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis are an American gangster couple in London, who are involved in a heist gone sour and who try to enlist Cleese, who is the usual half witted upper class Englishman, here a barrister, in salvaging what they can from the logistical disaster. Cleese falls in love with Curtis and gets in trouble with his family, predictably.<br />Michael Palin is also there, a linguistically challenged minor gangster, best as dog hitman, but also great with French fries, known as chips.<br />Otto is Italian, it means eight. Says Kline.
I am delighted to say that I, also, got an accidental copy of the Deluxe Edition before the release date was pushed back.  I am even more delighted to say that "A Fish Called Wanda" has finally gotten the special attention it so greatly deserves.  A masterpiece of hilarity, "Fish" is one of the rare films that managed to be wonderfully mean spirited (in the best way possible), truly subversive for a mainstream movie, and utterly hysterical.  The fact that it was a commerical success amazes me to this day.  Add to that, an Oscar for Kevin Kline--and I have to confess that Hollywood sometimes gets it right.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the film in a while, you're in for a treat.  It's as good as you remember--smart and clever--it takes it's comedy seriously.  It's fast, furious and takes no prisoners.  And it never dumbs itself down like so many "comedies".<br /><br />John Cleese is awesome in his best leading performance.  Michael Palin takes a character that would be a PC nightmare in the age of family-friendly homogenization and mines comic gold.  Kevin Kline--let's just say the Academy Award says everything it needs to.  And Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant.  She is so underrated as an actress, but every few years connects so vividly--"Fish", "True Lies" and "Freaky Friday" most noticably.<br /><br />You know any commentary by Cleese is going to be a winner.  Add the deleted scenes, featurettes, and other Cleese clips--and this is a tremendous find for fans of the movie.  I just hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  KGHarris, 9/06.
I didn't think that I was going to adore this movie as much as I do; don't really know why, but my expectations were rather low.  I know, Kline had won the Oscar and so maybe that should have sparked a little more interest, or at least faith in me, but I still saw this as a movie I was going to be mildly enthused about at best.  I was so wrong, for as the film started rapidly drawing to a close I found myself uttering aloud "this movie is outrageous" and I meant that in a wildly good way.<br /><br />The film tells the story of American jewel thief Wanda who uses her charm to seduce men whom she needs in order to get her hands on some very valuable diamonds.  Her lover Georges and his stuttering companion Ken help Wanda steal the jewels with the aid of Otto, another man whom Wanda has seduced and is passing off as her brother.  She has deceived each man into believing that her intentions are to share the jewels with them, when her intention is to take them for herself.  When Georges is captured by the police after moving the diamonds away from their initial hiding place Wanda begins to set her charms on Archie Leach, Georges barrister, hoping to find out the new location of the diamonds.  All the while she continues to string along each individual man, adding layer upon layer of lies to keep them pacified until she has all her ducks in a row so-to-speak.<br /><br />But nothing ever works out as expected.<br /><br />The film is hilarious from start to finish, a complete laugh-riot, and the performances by the entire cast are Oscar worthy.  Jamie Lee Curtis is adorable here, delivering what may be her finest performance ever.  She is sly, conniving, sexy and charming; never allowing her characters tricks to overshadow her performance but always playing to her strengths and delivering a brilliantly crafted comedic performance.  Michael Palin is also rather great as Ken, and Maria Aitken has a very memorable supporting role as Archie's wife Wendy.  John Cleese is golden as Archie, the lovelorn barrister who falls for Wanda's undeniable charm; but it is Kevin Kline (Oscar winner Kevin Kline) who steals this movie with his comedic delivery.  He is one-hundred percent on the top of his game here, delivering a strangely perverse yet fully fleshed out character who is unforgettable to say the least.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and he is so the leading male character here, regardless of whose name gets top billing.<br /><br />`A Fish Called Wanda' is, without doubt, one of the best films of 1988, and it is seriously one of the greatest comedies I have seen in a long time.  It hits every mark beautifully and creates an eclectic cast of characters who all feel real and all feel complete.  Oscar hit a high note when crowning Kline an Oscar winner; it's just too bad it was in the wrong category.
A wicked Ealing Comedy about twenty-five years after producer Michael Balcom stopped making them, "Wanda" is the inspired brainchild of John Cleese and director Charles Crichton (who directed such Ealing classics as "The Lavendar Hill Mob"). One part caper, one part sexy romance, two parts farce, three parts black humor, and altogether delightful. Even the actors with the smallest roles are hilarious, and the four principals--Cleese and Palin (the Brits), Curtis and Kline (the Yanks)--are gloriously funny. The Deluxe Edition is brimming with outtakes, commentary, and all that's needed to justify the price. But remember: "Don't call [him] stupid."
This movie is a wonderful comedy for those who, like me, enjoy off-beat humor.  Kevin Kline is always watchable, and he excells in this movie, and Jamie Lee Curtis is a perfect match for him.
First, let me agree with others:  this is a "bare bones" DVD with marginal sound, so-so visuals and virtually no special features.  Write your concerns to MGM.<br /><br />Well, I guess that leaves the "content" and (sorry to say?) it's well worth it.<br /><br />You get, for your money, some of the best comedic performances from some of the most gifted comic actors of the last century.  John Cleese is perfectly cast as a proper Brit who get sucked into Kevin Kline's impulse management issues.  If British people are represented by Cleese and Americans by Kline, here are some conclusions:<br /><br />1.  Cleese and Kline - make a great law firm??<br />2.  Brits are really staightlaced but quite sexy.<br />3.  Americans are completely unhinged, but effective.<br />4.  Neither seem to have much regard for animal rights.<br />5.  But, we're assured, none were harmed in the making of...<br />6.  Brits use steamrollers well.<br />7.  Jamie Leigh Curtis looked awesome.<br /><br />Yeah, the last one is shallow, but man, is it true...
This is an absolutely wonderful wacky movie, one of the funniest movies of the 1980s. It all has to do with a jewell heist and then some double crossings among the thieves, with a barrister (John Cleese)(it takes place in London) getting involved. The characters are what make the movie:<br /><br />Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) - feisty, the brains of the outfit, she can talk herself around anything; she's turned on sexually by foreign languages.<br /><br />Otto (Kevin Kline) - the dumbbell of the group who reads philosophy and practices martial arts; reads Nietzsche's "Beyond Good and Evil" as if it were a CIA manual; so dumb he thought "The Gettysburgh Address" was where Lincoln lived.<br /><br />Ken (Michael Palin) - has a terrible stutter and loves animals; spends the whole picture trying to kill an old woman who is a key witness only to wipe out her pet poodles one by one.<br /><br />After all kinds of incredible and improbable twists and turns, the barrister wins Wanda and off they fly to Rio with the loot. Everything is perfect here - the dialogue, the subtle sight gags which are perfectly timed, and the held shots used to highlight the most humorous aspects. The movie's pacing is excellent. A total joy. Definitely worth a watch - and more.
Charles Chrichton's hiatus from the big screen had been interspersed with The Avengers after his direction of The Lavender Hill Mob.  John Cleese in fact sought out Chrichton in hopes of a collaboration for A Fish Called Wanda.  Starting out with only a rudimentary idea of the story, and Chrichton's request that he wanted "...to see someone steamrolled", the final result was a film that somehow struck a humorous chord all over the world.  The film just somehow "worked", and it's been a cherished classic ever sense.<p>Kevin Kline as the violent, idiotic, and egotistic Otto indirectly steals the film, but it is John Cleese who is the genius behind the scenes.  Utilizing the dry absurd whit perfected in Monty Python with co-star Michael Palin, the duo alongside sultry Jamie Lee Curtis evoke a dysfunctional yet harmonistic world of laughs, slaptstick, and that oh so familiar English congeniality that "bloody well works" in comedy.<p>For those longing for the complicit, balanced, and tight-fitting humor of the older English comedies, such as Alec Guinness in Our Man In Havana, and Alec again in Lavender Hill Mob, A Fish Called Wanda is a must-see.  If only Hollywood knew what it was missing too.
This is a classic. It is hilarious. The dvd containes both full-screen and wide-screen formats, which is nice, because it's a good full screen film, so that's how I'll view it until I get a widescreen television. On the other hand, the 1:85:1 presantaion is non-anamorphic (Which MGM DVD'S are, though?). The 2-channel mono is thin and unrealistic, and the picture quality beats out my old analog rectangle, which I sold at a yard sale. However this  is, cheap, and I hear of an upcoming re-release. I won't buy it, because I already own it, although I might have to exchange this on Ebayif they have deleted scenes, no more mono, and restored and /or remastered picture and/or sound. The booklet spends too much time telling details must fans already know, like the difference between wide-screen and full-screen. There is also an easter egg where wanda the fish is floating around on your television screen. I am just glad that this is on DVD.  I understand that this came out at a time of no special features, but MGM rushed to get this out. They did the best they could, but why didn't they just wait 6 more months and give it a prper release? Only about 5% of the population HAD DVD players when this came out...I'm probably comnplaining for no use, because all I really want to see is possible deleted scenes. Other that that, as long as this surpasses in quality over my VHS, is in widescreen, and never wears out, as Austin Powers says, "I'll be sound as a bound."
It is extremely annoying when a title is re-released in Blu-ray format with no restoration, or for that matter with no improvement on the image quality provided by the original DVD. Most films placed on Blu-ray stand out because of their crystal clear image and excellent sound. This makes it worth buying again, even if one possesses the original DVD copy, simply to have the improved performance on the screen, which may be even further enhanced by good quality equipment. This Blu-ray edition is far inferior to the original DVD edition, which used to have a number of interesting extras and the Blu-ray has absolutely none!<br /><br />As to the film itself, in my opinion, it still rates as one of the best comedies ever to be produced for the cinema. A very clever story, by John Cheese, with tremendous dialogue and very good acting from all the principals. There are some exaggerations in the plot, but this is true of most comedies.<br /><br />I noticed that the Blu-ray edition of this film will be released in the UK in August. I hope that after this long delay, this release will have the necessary improvements, especially in image quality, to make it worth a 5 star rating, and possibly induce one to acquire once more.
funniest movie ever! from ken's stutter to wanda's foreign language fetish to otto's bad driving, this movie would make anyone laugh (except maybe  poodle lovers)!
Hard to believe it was nearly 20 years ago, but it is great to see "A Fish Called Wanda" finally being given the attention it deserves.  This was Cleese and Palin at their best, with fine performances from Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis, in this hilarious romp.  Kline is a veritable chameleon, able to turn in unique performances in one movie after another, but he never played someone quite like Otto.  He and Palin had so many memorable moments together, not least of all the closing scene.  This movie will leave you in stitches.
I just watched it again after many years and I still love it, which means its a classic as it stands the test of time.<br /><br />Highly recommended with people with a senses of humor...
A ordered the 2-Disc Collector's Edition of A Fish Called Wanda.  What a hoot!  I had a movie night with my husband, best friend and her husband (we had seen the movie together when it was first released) and our daughters in their late teens.  We all laughed out loud!  Jamie Lee Curtis is gorgeous, Kevin Kline is hysterical and John Cleese is just lovable.  The quality was very good.  I did not experience any problems at all with sound as a couple of people posted.  This I believe was the most recent re-release of the DVD.  I could have skipped the 2nd collector's DVD in the pack.  Some of it was entertaining, but very slow to watch.  Can't see that I would care to watch that part of it again.  I'm very happy to have the movie as part of my collection.  Absolutely recommend!
This is a great set of CD's. The disc describing the making of the movie is as amuzing as the movie itself.  The story line of the movie is a typical example of English odd ball humor. No Amercan writer could have possibly invented it.  Not many comedies can be viewed more than once but this one will make you laugh no matter how many times you view it.
For the fan of classic Cleese, you will not be disappointed.  This movie is blessed with a spectacular cast and a superb script.  The comic timing and sheer talent of the cast, make this one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is difficult to describe without resorting to spoilers.  One thing I will say, however, is that this film has made an indellible impact on my family.  Hardly a family gathering will go by, without someone saying, "Oh do shut up, Porche!"  Some of the most hilarious scenes, in my opinion, are between Otto (Kevin Kline) and Ken (Micheal Palin).  Strangely, even though the character's are supposed to be a band of thieves, you can't help but almost root for this gang of underdogs.  Speaking of Dogs, some of the scenes may not appeal to animal lovers.  However, these scenes are handled in a fairly cartoonish and very "Monty Python" fashion, so I don't think they will insult the sensibilities of most viewers.  This movie was given an R rating, mostly for dialog and a brief view of Cleese's buttocks, but I doubt that it would even receive a PG-13 rating now.  While it is not a movie I'd recommend for young children, as the humor is likely to be over their heads, I recommend this as one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last 15 years!
A great movie with a fabulous cast.  Super-funny and never lets up with the humor.  I enjoy watching again and again.
True to form, the cast of characters in this film deliver a hilarious performance.  A great 'pick-me-up' when you need to be entertained.<br /><br />John, Jamie, and Kevin play very well off of each other.  I would love to see them do something together again.
"A Fish Called Wanda" is a hilarious comedy which brings out some of the cardinal vices in people including avarice, murder, lust, envy, greed and revenge. The cast is excellent and the movie is fun throughout.<br /><br />The story starts with four people engaged in a jewellery robbery. The four, George (Tom Georgeson), sexy Wanda (Jamie Leigh Curtis), the stammering animal loving hit man Ken (Michael Palin) and Wanda's brother Otto (Kevin Kline) all want the loot for themselves. From this, an excellent plot is woven into a brilliant and exceptional comedy that is among my favourites of all time.<br /><br />George finds himself in prison, betrayed by his accomplices. The conservative lawyer, Archie Leach (John Cleese) has the duty to defend George. However, he is mesmerised and seduced by Wanda, resulting in him compromising his professionalism and getting deeply mired in the mess.<br /><br />When you are feeling down and need something to uplift or cheer you up, this DVD will do the trick.
This is a heart-warming piece of gem and still is today with memorable and outrageous performances by all the characters in the film. The film has all the makings of an unforgettable comedy classic: there are mis-adventures, farcical situations, silly bedroom scenes, characters not talking or making any sense at all, cheating, deception etc. all through the movie.<br /><br />It is especially up-lifting and should be seen during times of boredom, sadness or whenever you like and will cheer you up no sweat!<br /><br />The U.K. DVD is of good quality with a decent range of extras including deleted scenes presented by John Cleese, for UK region 2 viewers. It is certified 15 in the UK, (but the Amazon.com review states it is rated 18 for USA and Canada?)<br /><br />A must see.
This is an hilarious motion picture.  The cast is marvelous.  Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding, as is Kevin Kline.  John Cleese does a masterful job as a stuffy, English barrister.  He also wrote the screenplay.  The plot is great and the entire movie is full of hilarious scenes.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
This is one of the funniest movies of the eighties and it is the last true hurrah for Monty Python.  John Cleese (who must have been about fifty at the time) wrote the script himself.  It is filled with great little catch-phrases: "It's K-k-ken coming to k-k-kill me!" and "Oh, do shut up, Porsche." <p>It is basically a story of culture clash between modern England and America.  Cleese is voicing off about what is wrong with British culture.  Jamie Lee Curtis proves again here that she is a great comedic actress.  Kevin Kline deservedly won an Oscar for his performance.  (The two of them have the greatest love-making scene ever filmed!)<p>The DVD has no extras on it, but the movie itself makes it a definite must-have.  The transfer looks great and London never looked better.
This DVD is a must-have if you're a Monty Python fan.  I loved this move when it came out at the cinema years ago.  This movie is clever and hilarious.  John Cleese is at his best, as is Kevin Kline.  I've never gotten tired of this movie, and it never fails to get me laughing out-loud.  Wish more were like this one, and I'm glad it's on a DVD.
I still cackle every time I watch &quot;Wanda&quot; with its screwball story, its zany characters and its funny one-liners that get me every time.  The ensemble cast is tremendous, with Kevin Kline in his all time film role (and OScar winner) as Otto, while Jamie Lee Curtis proves her own comedic mettle in her scene-chewing moments with Cleese and Palin.  The dialogue is simply hysterical, and still likeable, which I think is truly rare in a film.  Without all that much gimmickry, the cast and plot work without a hitch (or rather, with so many hitches, your head'll be swimming with possibilities!)  But certain scenes are standouts - the dropping pianos, the language fetishes, and especially the interplay between Kline and Palin, who lash out at each other in unpredictable, pure comedy heaven moments!  You're guaranteed to love this &quot;Wanda-r&quot; - she's something else!
A Fish Called Wanda may be crude, but it is really a romantic comedy in the old fashioned sense of the word. It contains all the neccesary romance elements: an unlikely couple (Cleese and Curtis); a love triangle (in this case a love hexagon); and just about the right amount of sentiment sprinkled in, But it also posseses a wicked sense of humour the perfectly balances and compliments the romance. In a way, something to please everyone.<br /> The old fashioned whimsy of the tale combined with a sense of the macabre is heightened by the presence of Charles Chichton, one time director of many of the similarily dark Ealing comedies who masterly handles this story of a jewell robbery aftermath, with all it's backstabbing and bed hopping. In fact, Wanda could very much be considered an eighties desendent of Ealing.<br /> The cast is sublime. Cleese gives his usual but still enigmatic stuffy British suit performance as barrister Archie Leach, brilliant in the early scenes where he is stuck in his stale upper class marriage with an uncaring wife and a spoilt daughter. As Leach, defending gangster George (Tom Georgeson) on robbery charges begins an affair with chief defence witness and George's girlfriend Wanda (A gorgeous Jamie Lee Curtis).<br /> Kevin Kline performs a comedy masterclass as the ignorant, philosophy reading, violent tempered Otto, Wanda's &quot;brother&quot;, and he seems to have a problem with any men that show his &quot;sister&quot; too much attention.<br /> But Kline is just pipped to show stealing honours by Michael Palin, as the stuttering, animal loving getaway driver Ken. He's George's best mate, and also fancies Wanda, but thinks Otto is gay... oh, and he has a fish that's also called Wanda, which Otto doesn't like. Confused? You won't be, as this near note-perfect comedy fits together piece by piece as all and sundry double cross each other, before reaching a happy climax.<br /> Delicious in every sense of the word.
I've seen Wanda when it was released, about 12 years ago. It stayed on my memories as one of the funniest movies ever. Well, it still is appart the photography made it a bit dated. But the dialogues are still superb, first rate. The plot, too. Worth it, although the DVD doesn't have too many extras, just the now standard trailer and an 8 page booklet. Ah, it also has both widescreen and atandard screen formats.
i'll admit it - i'm extremely biased.  this is my favorite movie of all time.  but i like it with good reason.  four great roles wonderfully played by four great actors, in a crazy but hysterical plot with enough twists to keep any sane person glued to the screen.  kevin kline was born for this role and he certainly deserves that oscar, but michael palin, jlc, and john cleese more than hold their own.  if you have any faith in what i say, you'll be doing yourself a favor in watching this movie.
What makes this special is the interplay between American and English attitudes that is at its heart. This is a pet area of co-writer and star Cleese who has had three American wives and nurtures a fascination for the differences between the two cultures. This can be seen both in his work with Monty Python and in the Fawlty Towers episode The Americans. The conflict created between the characters' backgrounds creates much of the magic and gives the picture its transatlantic appeal. Cleese gives a career best performance as an actor, being surprisingly vulnerable in the love scenes and making us believe that he has fallen in love with Jamie Lee Curtis. Kline won an deserved Oscar for his very very funny supporting role, but all four stars contribute equally to this post-modern Ealing comedy. This leads me to mention Charles Crichton who co-directed with Cleese. In his last feature film, Crichton was in his late seventies when this was made. Having directed classic Ealing comedies The Titfield Thunderbolt and The Lavender Hill Mob, Crichton had retired from feature films in the 1960s and since then had turned in many well received episodes of television series such as The Avengers and The Professionals. His return to feature films marked a return to the form which had made him so successful in his Ealing days, garnering him commercial success and his only Oscar nomination.
John Cleese brought his Monty Python insanity and "Fawlty Towers" confusion to A FISH CALLED WANDA, a hilarious caper film about a diamond heist and all the double-crosses that come with it.<br /><br />What I really appreciate about the film is that comedy FINALLY got its due: Kevin Kline won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his inspired portrayal of Otto, the intense but dense hit man who loves spouting philosophy but can't hide his overwhelming ignorance of everything else.  Twenty years later, I still laugh out loud at his performance.<br /><br />I believe Michael Palin won the British Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as well--and he's hilarious as well!<br /><br />(I've always thought that comedy films have always been shortchanged: Peter Sellers should have won for DR. STRANGELOVE and Steve Martin should've been at least nominated for ALL OF ME and then nominated for Best Supporting Actor for LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.)<br /><br />Everything about WANDA works, even the little winks such as the name of Cleese's character, Archibald Leech--which was Cary Grant's real name (Grant and Cleese both come from the same part of England).<br /><br />A FISH CALLED WANDA is a comedy worthy of serious study.<br /><br />No kidding.
This movie is absolutely, positively deserving of a double-dip. The first disc that came out was not only non-anamorphic, it was pan & scan. The movie should have never been released in that format to begin with.
This DVD was supposed to be released yesterday, August 1, 2006, but all of a sudden it's been pulled. No explanation for what happened. You can't order it, preorder it, nothing. I've been looking forward to the release of this movie, one of the all-time great comedies, with the fantastic attendant extras, for months now, but for some reason nothing happened. I hope it's not yet another case of a brilliant but temperamental artist losing his nerve at the last minute and holding this thing up just to be contrary. Damn geniuses . . .
Fear not, DVD fans, a brand new Special Edition version will be released in the first quarter of 2002!
I seen this when it first came out in the theaters and I was laughing so much,tears were running down my face.The great thing about this movie and so many like it,is that it still holds up.It's not dated.Great writing,pacing and directing throughout..Wonderful cast...It's got a little bit of Python thrown in as well...How can you go wrong? You can't! I'm looking forward to the all of the extras,too...This is Cleese's finest hour,since leaving Python and Fawlty Towers....BUY THIS!!!
John Cleese, of Monty Python fame, co-wrote the screenplay for this hilarious comedy caper along with director Charles Crichton, who also directed "The Lavender Hill Mob." Cleese is totally irreverent and has absolutely no clue as to the meaning of political correctness. Everyone and everything is a target for satire. Cleese also performs here one of the most side-splitting stripteases I have ever seen. I literally doubled-over with laughter!<br /><br />A  twenty million dollar jewelry heist is pulled off in London's Hatton Gardens by four eccentric misfits, two Brits and two Americans. George (Tom Georgeson) is the ringleader, the man who masterminded the theft. He is the only one who knows where the jewels are hidden. His partners in crime include animal lover, Ken Pile, (Michael Palin), a socially inept bumbler with a stuttering problem. He loves his goldfish, Wanda, (named for the movie's heroine), with the passion most attach to their significant other. Wanda Gershwitz, (Jamie Lee Curtis), is George's girlfriend, who uses her formidable seduction techniques to get what she wants, and she wants all the money! Wanda finagles to bring Otto West, (Kevin Kline), into the gang, telling the others he is her brother - although like most other men in the film, he is her lover. And Kline is brilliant as the manic, Nietzche-reading, ex-CIA agent and Anglophobe. He is a self-styled intellectual, but is so stupid that he thinks the London Underground is a political movement. As Wanda remarks, "He's so dumb he thought the Gettysburg Address was where Lincoln lived."<br /><br />The ploys, dirty tricks and double-crosses Otto and Wanda use against their partners, to prevent their receiving a share of the loot, are classic. When George's lawyer, Archie, (John Cleese), falls in love with Wanda, her formidable skills at juggling men are seriously challenged. Cleese brings an endearing romantic touch to the smitten Archie. The situation grows more and more convoluted and the laughs build right along with the escalation. Otto is extremely jealous of any man who looks twice at Wanda, and obviously Archie takes more than two glimpses. Madcap madness!<br /><br />I don't want to disclose any more of the plot here, but "A Fish Called Wanda" contains some of the funniest scenes I have viewed on film. Director Charles Crichton keeps the pace moving at a nice clip and the satire involving the cultural clash between the very proper, if somewhat stuffy English, versus the uncouth, aggressive Yanks is pure delight. At one point, Archie says to Wanda: "Do you have any idea what it's like to be English? We're all terrified by embarrassment. That's why we're all dead!"<br /><br />This flaky farce is a must see! A definite 5 star film, I am rating this only 4 stars, however, because of the poor quality of the DVD. I advise renting the movie and waiting for the re-release before buying this comic masterpiece.<br /><br />JANA.
This gut-busting comedy starring Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cleese and Michael Palin deserves better.  The DVD has the worst sound I've ever experienced on DVD or VHS.  If you're used to 5.1 sound, mono just doesn't cut it.  It's one of my favorite comedies, and maybe my most disappointing DVD.
Mr. Kline is a great actor in everything he is in and he's in this with Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis. "A Fish Called Wanda" is very good. I can't really think of much to say about this movie, but just that it's cool. That's all I can really say to describe this movie. It is not boring, or anything either. You will be entertained the whole time!
What can I say this is a very funny film.  Don't waste time reading about it.  Buy or rent it and watch it.  You will not be disappointed.
I had heard of this movie from the late 80s but only watched it in 2012. I enjoyed it, I must say. Well worth renting. What more do you want me to say?
These four actors have such a great chemistry.  I also have Fierce Creatures which I love.  I wish they would make more movies together.
I  just loved this movie.  I watch it over again every so often and I laugh almost as hard as the first time I saw it.  I<br />have bought copies of it for my son and my granddaughter.  It is a really funny English comedy
Featuring two of the cast members of Monty Python, this movie is bound to be a delight.  The lineup of Cleese, Palin, Kline, and Curtis make for a delightful couple of hours as they romp through this zany, somewhat vulgar, and hilarious plot.
Because of "A Fish Called Wanda" I collapsed into laughter whenever I saw anyone walking three dogs. Many years later I still note a dog walker of any gender or quantity and smile. Because of this movie, whenever I walk down an airport concourse and glance out to see a tarmac with equipment, I start to grin. Lord know what Homeland Security reads into this! There are scenes that I fear are etched into my psyche forever. An perfectly trivial apology brings an image of someone dangling out of a window. Sturdy french fries on a plate - well, let's not go there.<br />I was sure I had this, albeit VHS. I AM sure I have it. Somewhere. But a recent down day called for Chicken Soup for the Soul - and "A Fish..." absolutely fits. Alas!!! I couldn't find it!! It was like not having aspirin in the medicine cabinet. I must buy the DVD. I don't want to get caught without it again.
So often when I go back and watch again a movie that I enjoyed long ago I find that it doesn't seem so good anymore.  But this movie is still hysterical!  Kevin Kline, in particular, is an absolute riot, but John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis are both great, too.<br /><br />If you are in the mood for some wild, silly humor, you could hardly do better than this.
This story is easier to grasp than it is to follow. But basically, a gang of jewel thieves double, triple and quad-triple cross each other, after twenty million dollars worth of jewels have been successfully lifted. It is not clear where the jewels are but not to worry. Kevin Kline eats every fish in the fish bowl as a form of torture to gain the missing information.<br /><br />The film is definitely a comedy but seriously acted. John Cleese, best known for "Monty Python" and especially the "Faulty Towers" series, is a serious barrister charged with getting the gang's leader off the hook. Until Jamie Lee Curtis' character enters, all seems to be going well. She wants the jewels for herself but needs to learn where there are. But wait, there is a witness. Watch out!<br /><br />And so it goes with plenty of serious laughs.<br /><br />Well worth seeing.
Saw this movie years ago, and decided to have it for my collection. It's still a great movie.  John Cleese and Kevin Kline are geniuses.
This film "A FISH CALLED WANDA' is a must have. It is funny, smart. I have only had this copy for a ashort time and have viewed it twice.
Yes, it is vulgar, coarse, crude, stupid--but it is full of spirit and fun, for teenagers of all ages. Excellent acting, infectious farce, politically incorrect disgrace, but at least not boring.
"A Fish Called Wanda" is considered a classic British comedy with American stars like Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline as Wanda and Otto, two American con-artists, along with British actors and Monty Python alums, John Cleese, and Michael Palin. Cleese played British barrister, Archie Leach, who is enticed by Wanda Gurwitz. Wanda and Otto have even their partners conned into thinking that they're brother and sister as well. Michael Palin played stuttering Ken whose main mission is to off Ms. Coady played by the wonderful actress, Patricia Hayes. The film was written, produced, and co-directed by John Cleese and the late Charles Crichton.<br /><br />Anyway, the cast is first rate and the writing as well. The direction is brilliant. Of course, BAFTAs went to John Cleese (lead actor) and Michael Palin (supporting actor) and an Academy Award for Actor in a Supporting Role to Kevin Kline's unforgettable performance as Otto. In my opinion, Kline steals the film most of the time but they're all scene stealers. Kline's Otto believes he's smarter than everybody else especially the British. Jamie Lee Curtis is also unforgettable and believable as the woman who is crossing everybody else in the film for the jewels.<br /><br />The first CD is the film. The second CD is the special features which include the making of the film; a message from John Cleese when the film was released; Robert Powell exploring the locations where the film was shot; the inception and completion of the film; alternate and deleted scenes with John Cleese pointing them out. I would have liked to have seen the Academy Awards clips when Kevin Kline won and accepted his award.
A Fish called Wanda is one of my favorite movies. I watch at least twice a year. Clearing out all my old VHS tapes and replacing with DVDs.
I first watched "A Fish Called Wanda" in about 1990 on a VHS tape. A lady friend at the time said is was very funny and I was sure to like it. Well, I think that set up some resistance and it took about a third of the movie to finally win me over. But win me over, it did. What an astonishing and absurd comedy! John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and all of the supporting cast are wonderful. The writing is exceptionally good. It's a fun movie to watch in a rich subtle way and the laughs are plentiful and deep in the old British comedy tradition.<br /><br />My wife and I now have the DVD and we've watched it twice and enjoyed it both times. This movie is amazing. Watch it and enjoy. When the memory somewhat fades, watch it again. It's a movie that can be repeated over and over.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
I love this movie and as far as comedies go its a 10 out of 10 . Kevin Kline is fantastic and I dont think that this movie would be near as good without him . Kline really does steel the show but others such as Curtis , Cleese , and Palin are good also . I laughed from start to finish .
The best Monty Pyhton film that the group did not make.  You should watch this film just for Kevin Kline's Oscar-winning performance.  This a comedy classic!
This film has a great team of actors that will turn up again in the film "Fierce Creatures."<br /><br />Three professional criminals including Georges (Tom Georgeson) set out to steel some diamonds. They need a fourth person with martial or weapons skills. This person Otto (Kevin Kline) is Wanda's (Jamie Lee Curtis) supposed brother.<br /><br />Each criminal then covets the pilfered plunder individually. Wanda has the upper hand until the diamonds are not where they are supposed to be.<br /><br />The only way to obtain their location is for Wanda to rub up against Georges' barrister, Archie Leach (John Cleese.) This close encounter irks Otto. This creates a pericoloso situation.<br /><br />Will the diamonds be found and by whom?<br /><br />The character interaction and one-liners make the movie.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225490">Fierce Creatures</a>
One of the funniest movies ever made, and a must-have for any fan of Cleese, Palin, Curtis, or Kline.  How many comedies do you know that win the best-actor Oscar?
The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A hilarious comedy which features a number of excellent comic turns (Kevin Kline was rightly rewarded with an Oscar), A Fish Called Wanda gets funnier upon multiple viewings and also--importantly--develops characters that we actually care a little about; all things considered, it's a supremely enjoyable film.
Monty Python's John Cleese once again offers up a spectacular example of what makes him such a revered comedic force.  Written by Cleese and set in London, this comedy has the drama of a bank robbery and subsequent legal proceedings and a romantic twist.  Yet, this is not a "chick flick" by any means.  Cleese's Monty Python buddy Michael Palin delivers a stellar performance as the stuttering hold-up sidekick, as JC plays the barrister (defense lawyer) for the man who organized the robbery.  Again...since Cleese wrote it and sets it in London, there are only 2 American main characters (which in typical British form) Cleese busts on by giving them playfully negative American stereotypes: Jamie Lee Curtis plays a girl who will (let's keep it clean) "hook up with" and then stab in the back anyone who can make her rich.  And Kevin Kline plays an obnoxious, loud-mouthed vulgarian who pretends to be smart and classy, but truly shows no intelligence and is gauche and tasteless.  Don't take it too seriously though, my fellow Americans....this movie is great fun!  The story unfolds beautifully, and the subtly developing romance between Cleese and Curtis (which begins as an opportunistic ruse by Curtis that blossoms into something more) is handled quite well.  For fans of British comedy, there are also small appearances by other British stars such as Geoffrey Palmer and Steven Frye as well.  Cleese, who has given us so much in the world of comedy, delivers once again!  5 stars to this wonderful comedy classic!
The characters in this film are despicable, back-stabbing, liars.  One is a manipulative vixen who'll use sex to get what she wants.  One is a hit-man who loves animals but is perfectly willing to kill an old lady.  One is the ultimate "ugly American" who is ultra-"stupid", vulgar, and in love with himself.  Finally, there is the respectable British lawyer who takes all but 2 seconds to decide to throw away his marriage and go after the young temptress.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I absolutely love this movie.  Kevin Kline incredibly, manages to steal the comic thunder from the two veteran Monty Python players.  It's really too bad that they never made another movie with Kline's Otto character.
This movie is a flawlesly funny film. Kevin Kline is drop to the floor hilarious in this movie. It is a well written, well acted movie that is as funny the 30th time around as it was the first time. One of the all time great comedies.
I bought "Fierce Creatures" ages ago which I highly enjoyed, but after watching it I stumbled across some really negative reviews on the web, saying that compared to its predecessor, "A Fish Called Wanda" it was really not very funny. I personally thought "Fierce Creatures" was really good and made me laugh a lot, so I thought "A Fish Called Wanda" must be amazing. I have to admit it didn't make me split my sides, but there were some memorable and funny bits, such as Michael Palin [what a guy!]who plays ken, an animal lover with a stutter, trying to assassinate and old lady and killing her 3 dogs instead by accident, also Kevin Kline rugby tackling John Cleese, shouting "I just want to apologise" and then aiming a gun up his nose when he won't shut up, unknowingly watched by Cleese's character's wife, who doesn't care. Another comical bit was Kline screaming at Cleese's character's wife about her englishness.<br /><br />John Cleese has written a brilliant film, and the casting is superb, and even if you dont find it as hilarious as some did, it is certainly enjoyable.
This film is just another example why that small island off the coast of Europe is one of the top producers of some great understated humor! Top marks around for all hands!
This film is a piece of art. Every time I see it I find something new to laugh at.<br /><br />This is not a Monty Python film, even if both John Cleese and Micahel Palin act in it.<br /><br />The first time I saw it I was disappointed: was this it? Then I saw it a second time, and could not stop laughing. Other people, including my wife, have reported the same experience. It improves with time, and you cannot say that about many films!<br /><br />The acting is superb. Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis even steal the film from Cleese and Palin, which is a feat in itself. Kline has reportedly claimed that it was his favourite performance.<br /><br />I think that the viewer has to be prepared that the humour might be inspired by the classical Ealing comedies, which moved in a border between the bizarre and the realistic. It is not quite Monty Python, but it is not quite mainstream either. Just take the absolutely absurd characters played by Kline and Palin: they just could, barely, exist in real life.<br /><br />The story and the characters are more complex than one would expect from an ordinary comedy, and it might also be a reason why it takes a few watchings before the laughter erupts. Then, on the other hand, it becomes one of the truly funniest film ever made.
John Cleese a veteran of that famous ensemble , Kevin Kline who won an academy Award by this role and Jamie Lee Curtis star possibly one of the top comedies of that decade (together with Buffet froid and Consuming passions) with irreverent doses of black humour and unexpected situations. You are forewarned about Wanda who has something under his hat that eventually can offend you.
Okay I watch this movie so much my poor videotape is begging me to put it out of it's misery.  Which is why I will be getting the DVD of this soon.  Backstapping and comedy, the perfect combination for this film.  Well cast and just tons of fun to watch.
