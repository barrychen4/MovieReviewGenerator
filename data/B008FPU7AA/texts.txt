One Body Too Many a 1944 black and white movie is not an especially good movie. BUT, it is a fun movie. It is a silly horror/comedy type B movie that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studios. I love it. Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose to the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with an old rich recluse. He arrives at his mansion and is seen in by the butler (Bela Lugosi). He is shown into his clients office and immediately starts his spiel to the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar. However, unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office. Tuttle lays his brief case on the closed coffin before he realizes just what is in the room. When he does try to get out, he can't open the door, etc. This movie is filled with every conceivable cliche imaginable. But that's the fun of it. A huge dark creepy house, a will to be read, a suspicious looking butler and cook, a beautiful damsel in distress, a dim witted detective, a houseful of greedy family members of the deceased, murders, trick doors, screams and noises at night, etc. Of course, a very nervous and reluctant hero. This kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he is here as the family member who thinks timid Jack Haley has something to hide.I have had this movie for years and every once in a while I dust it off to watch it again because sometimes you need a little harmless fun. (~.~)
This is yet another of the gathered-for-the-reading-of-the-will-in-the-spooky-house with-secret-passages-and-a-murderer subgenre. And while I find it hard to believe that there is anyone who legitimately can hate these kind of movies, there are admittedly some that work far better than others. One Body Too Many finds middle ground.<p>It begins with some cleverness in setting up the scenario. The will's gimmick is farfetched but assured an offbeat night of criminal mayhem: The deceased, an astrologer, wishes to be buried above ground so that the stars shine down on him. If anything happens so that he is not, then the heir who was supposed to get the most will instead get the least, and vice versa. The body disappears, then reappears, then someone else is murdered... it's all expectedly, even appropriately, convoluted.<p>Our hero is a life insurance salesman who is mistaken for the detective assigned to guard the body from shenanigans. And there is real inventiveness in placing a life insurance salesman in this situation, where people are sure to be bumped off. Unfortunately, this knowing wink to the audience is barely explored at all. The hero himself is an average-looking guy, more likable and less wimpy than many 40's B heroes. And he is surrounded by a capable, if unspectacular, cast.<p>Lugosi is wasted, although his stock Ominous Butler character is interestingly played for laughs this go-round, ready and willing to bump off anybody who anyone else thinks needs bumping off. Watch out for the coffee.<br /><br />This is of course, a comedy/mystery, as every picture in this genre has been since The Cat and the Canary in the 20's. And the comedy is generally the determining factor in how watchable these kind of films are. Here it is not too bad, consisting less of the typical scared mugging and awkward pratfalls than many similar efforts. Only in its dull, protracted middle section does the film lose its way, as the hero gets lost in the ubiquitous secret passageways, caught in a wicker basket with a litter of kittens and wearing only a towel. Don't ask.<p>There are a number of good scenes, including one where the hero, hiding in a coffin, is carried off and dumped in a pool. The movie ends with a suspenseful chase and confrontation atop the observatory. But there is not enough made of the good ideas in the script, and too much damage is done to the whole by the weak or old ideas in the script. You've seen much of it before, so it's not quite worth a purchase. Close but no cigar.<p>See also: The Cat and the Canary; Black Cat (1941); Night Monster; Old Dark House; The Monster Walks; The Gorilla; Seven Keys To Baldpate; The Bat Whispers; and many, many more, if you are so inclined.
"One Body Too Many" (1944) is a routine Jack Haley mystery-comedy with decent production values and an agreeable supporting cast. The "B" programmer remains notable for Bela Lugosi's delightful presence as a coffee-serving butler - the funniest of his red-herring roles. In fact, Bela garners more laughs than Haley's cut-rate version of Bob Hope.
I borrowed my title from "The Shadow."  I have no idea why, but since most of the action in this movie takes place at night, the phrase seemed appropriate.  Anyway, insurance salesman Albert Tuttle (Jack Haley, whose career included the Shirley Temple movies "Poor Little Rich Girl" and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm," and the role of the Tin Man in "The Wizard of Oz"), arrives at the home of Mr. Cyrus Wentworth, where he is supposed to be selling Mr. Wentworth an insurance policy.  Unfortunately, Mr. Wentworth has already passed away.<br /><br />Mr. Wentworth has specified that certain conditions must be met before his heirs get the goodies.  On the other hand, if the conditions are not met, the terms of his will are to be reversed.  Soon people are dying and disappearing, and Albert Tuttle ends up in a coffin in the pond.  It is mostly in good fun with periodic humor thrown in.  Bela Lugosi lurks about as butler Murkil.  Since I knew of Bela Lugosi's history in horror I kept thinking that Lugosi was the bad guy in this movie.  You will have to watch and see about that.<br /><br />This movie has all the attributes of an Old Dark House type of movie.  There are sinister locations and characters, and murders that seem to have been impossible.  We do not find out who is doing all the deeds until the end of the movie, which is full of action.  This movie is neither the best in this genre nor the worst.  This movie did have some fun moments and I found myself glued to the television while waiting for events to unfold.  Fans of 1940's murder mysteries will find this one to be interesting to watch with several very enjoyable scenes.<br /><br />Enjoy!
When rich man Cyrus J. Rutherford dies all the heirs show up for the reading of a bizarre will. While Cyrus's unique tomb is constructed, the heirs stay in the house. The will insults the heirs, then claims that some will get vasts amounts while others get cab fare. If Cyrus's body is not interned by his wishes then the heirs will swap places, i.e. those that get the most will now get the least. No one knows who is going to get what, they can only guess...or does someone know? Bela plays the butler who tries to give everyone "poisoned" coffee late in the evening, which they all refuse. Jack Haley (The Tin Man) plays an insurance agent who shows up to sell the dead Cyrus a policy, not knowing he is deceased. The guests mistake him for the detective they hired to guard the body.<br /><br />Of course Bela is not the only seemingly trying to knock off heirs...Then there are those who suspect they are the least of the heirs. They want to steal and hide the body so they can get a greater share. Sweet Carol Dunlap (Jean Parker) is suspected of getting the largest share. Lyle Talbot, who starred in so many Ed Wood films is in this one as well as Dorothy Granger from "Death Valley Days."<br /><br />The sound track at times indicates this is a "horror" film while at other times a comedy. It is far from a horror movie. At one point when someone is killed, the suspects are all gathered into one room, as a real who-dun-it murder mystery, except with the comedy of Jack Haley leading the spoof.<br /><br />This is an excellent film which has stood the test of time. The jokes are a bit punny. It is not a blockbuster, but one that certainly can be enjoyed and appreciate by a younger generation. My only negative on this film is that the copy I saw could have used some restoration, especially the sound track.
In ONE BODY TOO MANY, Bela Lugosi is amusing as the frustrated butler who can't get anyone to drink his rat poisoned coffee. Except for a couple of outdoor scenes, this highly underrated dark house farce could easily be a stageplay.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Insurance man Jack Haley is unaware that the wealthy oldster he's got an appointment with has died. Nervous Nelly Haley is mistaken for a hired detective/guard by relatives and business associates of the dearly departed who have gathered at his mansion for a reading of the will's preamble.<br /><br />This intro states that if the deceased isn't interred under glass, those who are to receive $1 will instead get a lion's share of the estate and vice-versa. The many who feel they'll be otherwise shut out, scheme to either make the body disappear or to kill those few who may be in for a windfall. Whether he likes it or not, Haley is caught up in the madness. Before this night is over, very strange things are sure to occur!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(5.0) One Body Too Many (1944) - Jack Haley/Jean Parker/Bela Lugosi/Blanche Yurka/Lyle Talbot/Douglas Fowley/Fay Helm/Lucien Littlefield
This was a great film. Jack Halley is comical as usual and Bela Lugos is hilarious even in his tiny role. I love this flick.

This film begins at a Life Insurance Company. Eight million dollars was a lot of money then. One agent wants to make a big sale. A lawyer reads the last will for millionaire Cyrus Rutherford. Was he of a sound mind? The heirs will have to live in the house until after the burial. Who will watch the body? Are there too many rats around? "This coffee will not keep you awake." Will the insurance agent be mistaken for a detective? Who will benefit from the will? Who hit Albert? What happened to the body? Does the plot have a clue to the villain? Who will hide the body?<br /><br />Will they find a dead body? The telephone line is also dead. Will Albert be rescued? Is there a secret passage in the old house? Will Albert wander in different rooms? [Does this pad out the story?] "I think I've had enough." "I can explain everything." Will another body be found? Or two? Will the real killer be discovered? Will they all fall into a trap? The last scenes provide an explanation. "Such fine coffee!" [Coffee was rationed during the war.]<br /><br />This film is still entertaining after seven decades. A bigger budget would have made it a better film. But there was war-time rationing for movie sets.
Albert Tuttle (Jack "Tin Man" Haley) is an eager life insurance salesman on a mission. He's been trying to get an appointment with Cyrus Rutherford, a reclusive, eccentric millionaire for months. Tonight, he's finally done it! Unfortunately, his latest policy prospect has just died, leaving a mansion full of greedy relatives, waiting for their share of the inheritance. Tuttle arrives and is mistaken for a guy who was supposed to guard the old boy's body, so the relatives can sleep without worrying about who might bury uncle Cyrus (a stipulation in the will forbids burial). ONE BODY TOO MANY has plenty of mystery, murders, secret passages, and enough laughs to keep things fun. Jean Parker (Beyond Tomorrow) is the love interest. Bela Lugosi is his normal grumpy self as the butler who is constantly pushing coffee on people that just might be poisoned! Lyle Talbot (Plan 9 From Outer Space, Torture Ship) is suave, dapper, and in constant search of booze. All in all, a good flick for a cold, clammy night...
William Pine and William Thomas were two Paramount executives who joined together to produce some cheap little pictures with Paramount backing and distribution. They became known as the "dollar Bills" for churning out inexpensive pictures that always made money. At first, they specialized in aviation pictures (their first three films were POWER DIVE, FORCED LANDING, and FLYING BLIND, all released in 1941), but when the war began they broadened their screens to include military adventures, mysteries, and even musicals. Like many B outfits they had a stock company of directors (Frank McDonald, William Berke) and players (Richard Arlen, Chester Morris, Roger Pryor and others).<br /><br />Late in the war, Pine-Thomas signed Jack Haley to star in musical-comedies, but the first one, TAKE IT BIG (with Ozzie and Harriet) was a disappointment, so they cast Haley in a mystery-comedy called ONE BODY TOO MANY.<br /><br />Cyrus Wentworth, a crazy multi-millionaire, has died, leaving a will that insults his heirs and promises that half of them will get a lot of money and the other half will get piddle, unless the exact terms of his will aren't carried out, in which case the piddlers will become the piddlees and vice versa. And the terms of his will? He was an astrology nut (who built an observatory atop his decrepit old mansion) and he wants to be entombed with a skylight so he can look up at the stars. Also, everybody named as an heir has to stay in the house for three days until he's safely in his moon-roofed vault. Okay, so you can guess what happens: somebody has read the will, knows he (or she) is a piddlee, and decides to steal the old man's corpse so he can't be entombed, thereby making himself a piddler. Got that? And if anybody gets in his (or her) way, well, then, said anybody is gonna end up vault-shopping with Uncle Cyrus.<br /><br />Okay, you'd think that would be enough plot, but NO! An eager insurance salesman named Tuttle (Jack Haley) shows up; it seems that he had an appointment with the recently deceased to sell him some life insurance (a little late, there, Tuttle). Haley immediately falls in love with one of the old boy's relatives, the delicious Jean Parker, and decides to stay and protect her. The problem is, he spends the rest of the film cowering, running, hiding, and in general doing everything he can to not impress her. Bob Hope he ain't. Funny he ain't, either. Neither?<br /><br />Okay, lastly I will mention that there is a creepy butler and housekeeper (naturally), the former of whom is Bela Lugosi in a throw-away part. We see him getting a bottle of rat poison off the shelf ("Dere are too many rats in dis houssssse... dey should be done avay vith!") and then spending the rest of the film offering coffee to the assembled, with a look of chagrin when they all refuse (or what passes for chagrin on Lugosi's mug; it could've also been anger, humor, annoyance, horniness, or impatience that his giant bats hadn't arrived yet).<br /><br />ONE BODY TOO MANY is one Jack Haley scare comedy too many. The Alpha DVD is okay, though, if you're gonna take the plunge anyway.
