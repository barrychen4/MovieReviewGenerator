Why is this a pick for some film festivals?  Looking for something different, and not much available I suppose.<br /><br />Starts off being overly salacious. Keeps a bit of that throughout.  The directing is herky, jerky and not very real.  Characters are similar.  Acting is poor at best.  Story is a bit off kilter and perhaps the only redeeming quality.  But so much of the basic interaction is wholly unbelievable.  Quality of video at least as a streaming Amazon  movie is poor.<br /><br />Kept wanting to like it, but never could.  Cliched and no real redeeming value, no intrigue, no real reason to watch it.  Don't waste your time, better stuff is out there.
