This is Serious Religious Satire? (DOGMA)
Pass this one by.
What a horrible movie
I hate this movie more than life itself
Don't waste your time... BORING and ANNOYING
sacrilegious and funny
Brilliant
Definitely for twentysomethings.
Steer clear of this clunker
Dogma is a dog.
Why the critics hate this show...
What a Dud!
TERRIBLE MOVIE
Pretentious Pseudo-intellectualism
Dogma blends humor with thought
Sloppy, self-important, and, ultimately, dull and dumb.
All hail the King of dvds (God, this is good)
Why did I wait so long to see this movie?
One of the best movies EVER!
Yea Kevin Smith!
Dogma at it's best!
"God? Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor."

A more balanced and thought out review than my last one.....
Dogma is a pure pleasure to see over and over again
Faith May Be A Funny Thing, but DOGMA is Hilarious!!!
I'd really give it 4  1/2 (it's great, but can't top Clerks)
