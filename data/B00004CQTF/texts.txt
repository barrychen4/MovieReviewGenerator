This is a heavily abridged version of Peter Brook's wonderful film.  About 1/2 the film has been cut from this version.  I owned the VCR version of this movie which is 325 minutes long.  I had assumed this was a long-awaited reprint of an out-of-print classic.  Instead, this is a HEAVILY abridged (170-minute) version of the show.<br /><br />I bought this as a birthday present for my husband, after five minutes of watching painful cut after painful cut, we had to turn the film off.  I will be returning it ASAP.<br /><br />I have NO IDEA why the studio did this.<br /><br />Amazon.com should mark this as an ABRIDGED VERSION.<br /><br />I can only hope that the studio comes to their senses and released a version of the DVD that is the full 325 minutes, because the VCR tapes I bought 14 years ago are wearing out...
This excellent multinational production of the Mahabharata feels almost Shakespeaerean at times - the language so eloquent and poetic, the themes so profound and universal, the action so epic.  Truly great literature brought to film.<p>Briefly, the Mahabharata is a tale of two rival sets of brothers, cousins to eachother, each born into royalty and with divinely guided paths in life.  The result, however, is a great war, death, destruction, but a final glimmer of light preserved.  Vishnu after Shiva.<br />.<br />Peter Brook's five-hour version of the Mahabharata is theatrical, philosophical, spare, poetic.  It is rendered in gentle, nearly monochromatic hues and with often silent backgrounds, interspersed with periods of hauntingly beautiful music. The actors are gifted, if a bit too grand and mythic in their presentation.  As in the written versions, the characters motives are seen to be, in turns, grounded and human, and unearthly and enlightened.<p>Such a powerful mix, and such a penetrating vision of life -- all from over three thousand years ago!<p>I highly recommend this film, anbd the special features of the DVD make it that much more valuable.
I too grew up hearing stories of the Mahabharata and watched this adaptation on the BBC a few years back.  This is theatre at its best, and it truly captures the essence of the Mahabharata.  The stories and concepts are all covered, but those who are expecting an all Indian cast wearing traditional garb will be sorely disappointed.  Hinduism is a way of life, a faith of choice and plurality.  These ideas are reinforced with a multicultural cast.  When I first heard that it was not an all Indian cast, my expectations for the play dropped dramatically, but I can assure you, what Peter Brook has done is astonishing.  I look forward to watching this with my children, though after they have been inundated with bedtime stories from the Mahabharata.
I have been eagerly awaiting Peter Brooks' The Mahabharata on DVD, and today it arrived.  How disappointed I was to find this version is a little over half as long as the one shown on the BBC and PBS.  I have not watched this version yet, but I cannot believe it will be anything but a slice-and-dice version of the epic tale that I came to love in its television miniseries form and later on laserdisc.  So a warning to everyone:  if you want the full miniseries, THIS IS NOT IT!
Years ago I watched this on television and later video.  I was blown away by the depth of the material and the performances of the cast.  This is definitely no hollywood production but it is great theatre.  I emphasize that it is just that - theatre.<br /><br />I have since read the original Indian texts (translated) and it took me many months, the writing was complicated and it took me ages just to identify with the names (sorry but I have a Western upbringing).  Once I got over this it is fair to say that the intricacies and subtleties of the full story are completely lost from Peter Brooks work. Completely!  This is probably why so many people who are familiar with the text are so unhappy with this version.<br /><br />Chopra's - very long (but well priced and a great series) - interpretation is far more faithful but lacks, in my opinion, the intensity that is present in Brook's work.  Chopra's version whilst being far more faithful is also clearly aimed at Indian TV audiences (e.g., there are filler scenes that breakup the momentum of the story) also the audio quality on my DVDs and subtitling is poor.<br /><br />I have since watched Brook's version many times and decided it is not really a story about the Mahabharata at all (it seems very different now) but nevertheless carries a story of its own (perhaps more of Brook's story) but its real strength is its ability to enthrall with very little else but strong characters and a few props.... that is just great theatre in my mind!<br /><br />But it would be a mistake to take a 5 hour interpretation of the text as faithful - especially since Chopra took 94 episodes to do the same (which still misses some things in the text - I definitely recommend Chopra's version - definitely good value and conceptually much deeper than Brook's version).  But the names are the same and Brooks version gives a taster to the wisdom of the text.  I love Brook's (and strongly recommend it) version as a theatrical work but now believe it should never have been called the Mahabharata.
This is a disappointing, sliced and diced version of the long epic shown on public television many years ago.  The cuts change the storyline and make it difficult to follow, especially in reference to the amazing 5+ hour original.<br /><br />Buyer beware!  This is not the original, full length version.
My wise cousin told me to watch this film before I come to visit her in India, and how right she was. The story of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; permeates Hindu culture in much the same way the Bible has formed Western consciousness. But such a story! The basic tale is of a feud between two branches of a family, rulers, sons of gods but all too human. Having no prior knowledge of this great epic I found it a bit confusing at first, a lot of background is related in a brief beginning, the multi-national, multi-racial cast led to a little confusion among characters. But the story line quickly develops as the legitimate heir loses his kingdom to the other branch of the family in a crooked dice game. The tension builds as Yudhishthira gambles inexorably for higher and higher stakes, finally losing his brothers and beloved wife. He is offered one final chance to redeem all or escape, and agrees to throw the dice one more time against his brothers' advice, and loses. His reason--&quot;I had to give the cheaters one more chance to save themselves.&quot;<p>This is the first of many very complicated moral dilemmas presented, but there are no easy answers here. Is it permissible to lie to avoid a greater harm? Is cheating in a fight wrong, even if your opponent is guilty of many wrongs against you? At first it seemed that there were good guys and bad guys in this story, a notion sometimes reinforced in imagery, such as in the chariot fight between Karna and Arjuna, with black and white horses. But we quickly see that life isn't so simple--the good guy strongman Bhima kills his enemy and eats his heart with gory relish. Even the god-man Krishna urges tricks to defeat the enemy.<p>The women in the story were strong, complicated, grounded. Can a woman love five husbands equally? Yes, in this world. Does the mother of five sons grieve for the sixth she abandoned long ago and who became the enemy of his brothers? Yes, and her pain is compelling.<p>I felt I could watch this film many times and still not understand all of it. The vision of the world is so different from a western view--gods and men together in the world, good and evil existing within both. And I'm sure this wasn't a totally faithful rendition of the story. But compared to the impossibility of picking up the text cold and trying to read it, this is a wonderful alternative.
I was entranced by The Mahabharata, as presented by Peter Brookes. Since my childhood, I have heard, read and seen The Mahabharata in my mother tongue, English and Hindi. Irrespective of the medium, it has always impressed with the great canvas on which human yet larger than life characters are etched but the grandeur of the drama has often masked the underlying philosophy - that the difference between humans and gods is infinitesimal, that every person is imbued with some qualities that are god-like (so that depending on circumstances anybody can appear god-like), even the so-called gods have human frailties and can be touched and befriended.<br />Peter Brookes has successfully denuded the characters of their physical attributes and forced us to really understand this philosophy that we too can become gods depending on which qualities we care to nurture within our selves.
I was disappointed when this version came out that people were being negative about it without even purchasing it. I didn't heed their warning and purchased it anyway.<br /><br />We live in a great age. We can get complete seasons of television shows. We can get movies with hours of behind the scene footage that enhance the experience. With all of these great things, why would a company abridge a great work like this? The six hour version was already abridged from the nine hour play. The nine hour play was abridged from a 5000 page book.<br /><br />I tried to watch this version but I felt like I was seeing a flashback episode of a TV series.<br /><br />We all have been awaiting a re-release of the six hour version. This is an insult to a great work.
I was raised on stories from the Mahbharata and my parents showed me this movie when I was about ten years old.  Even though it is low budget and very, very long, I loved it.<br /><br />I started showing it to my friends, who have no Indian background or knowledge at all and they loved it too.  I'll never forget when we were about thirteen years old we started watching it at a sleepover and were too tired to finish.  In order to see the whole thing before our moms came to take us home we would have to wake up at 6:00 am.  I decided we would schedule the rest for another time, since sleeping in is a part of a sleepover.  To my surprise my friends all woke up at 6:00 to see the rest.<br /><br />It is an amazing story that grows bigger than itself somehow.
It was more than ten years ago that the Dutch television broadcasted 'The Mahabharata' by Peter Brook. First on three wednesday evenings, a couple of months later on one evening with just enough breaks to get to the toilet or get some coffee. This old story about the beginnings of Indian history, culture and religion is a fascinating story, with all the questions concerning life itself in it. We had it on video and watched it at least once every year, but for the last couple of years because the videotapes got worse. Now we have the dvd's (after a long search) and enjoy the whole action, the thoughts, the colors and the depth of the whole play.
I cannot comment on how faithful this is to the original.  Nor can I comment on whether or not it may or may not be offensive to Hindus.  I don't know.  I hope it isn't, however, because it is certainly a beautiful work of theatre as art.  My family begged me to watch this for years and years, but with raising a family, I just didn't have a spare 5-6 hours.  Recently, however, I finally had time -- and it was so worth it.  The performance was so finely acted and directed.  I think especially of the brother who tells a lie for the first time.  How he touches his lip after the words are spoken, amazed that untruth could come out of his mouth.  I think about the actor who played Krishna -- Wow!  And especially, the actor who plays the old blind king.  That is just so well done.  At any rate, if it is offensive to Hindus, then don't see it.  But if it isn't, then it is truly worth the time.
Weighing in at 5 hours and 25 minutes, "The Mahabharata" is an epic tale based on the religious text of the same name.  While I'm far from ignorant of the Mahabharata, I'm no expert.  All I've read is the Baghavad-Gita.  You certainly don't need to be well-read on Hindu mythology to appreciate this film.  I first saw this film by renting it at a video store specializing in rare and imported videos.  I then purchased it through Amazon.com because this was something I just had to have.  The film is actually a stage play.  But don't let that discourage you into thinking that you will simply be watching actors perform on a stage.  This is one extravagent production!  The costumes are very rich, the sets are large and realistic, and the camera work is angled and edited in such a way that you'll think you're watching a film instead of a straight stage production.  For example, during the war chapter, actual horses are brought onto the stage where dozens of actors fight in a well choreographed manner!<br /><br />  The acting is something that I have never seen before.  I don't get out to see many plays, but what I've seen in this is amazing.  The camera gets in tight on the actors faces and these actors do a superior job of expressing severe intensity.  Especially the two actors who play Krishna and Arjuna; wow!<br /><br />  If you're into Hindu mythology on any level, then I assure you that you will enjoy this film.  Despite its length this film never gets boring.  Mind you, I wouldn't suggest watching this in one sitting.  There are two discs, watch one, and watch the next one the next day.
Mahabharata, directed by Peter Brook, is a great movie. It is a must see for all who are interested in epic mythology and who would like to understand more about the religious philosophies and culture of India. As an Indian I have heard countless stories about Mahabharata and seen many Indian movies based on Mahabharata. The story is vast and often spawned many discussions on arguments on why things were what they were - the plot, chartecters, etc. I first saw the theatrical version of the Peter Brook version in 1989, and was amazed by the beauty and grandeur of the production and also was quite impressed how effectively the strory was told and enacted by an international cast of stage and screen actors.  Mahabharata is a must collect item and worth watching once every year !!!
If you are ever roving around in the video store (or library, for that matter), and are looking for a film that is going to make you think, keep you on the edge of your seat, teach you important life lessons, and appeal to your senses, "The Mahabharata" is the film for you. However, you are going to need a whole day to fully appreciate this masterfully told story.  (It clocks in at around 8 hours, total.)  I know that sounds daunting, but, believe me, it is well worth it.<br /><br />One of the most gifted geniuses of the stage, Peter Brooke, has directed/produced an amazing labor of love, with his adaptation of the epic Sanskrit collection of stories, centered on two sets of warring brothers (the Pandavas and the Kauravas), both in hot pursuit of the throne.<br /><br />It took Peter Brook eight years to fully conceptualize and complete this film, and it shows.  The actors span a dozen countries, come from a cross-section of backgrounds and are also multi-generational.  In his choice of casting, it truly cuts to the heart of, what I believe is the central point of "The Mahabharata."  It is the story of the plight of mankind.  If that isn't a more universal story, I don't know what is. Beautiful, brilliant, and very appealing to a diverse audience.
Dammit - I wish I had read the reviews more carefully - this is so badly abridged that if you don't know the story already it is very difficult to follow. I have wasted my money on this, and will now have to buy the full version.
Many reviews here deplore the butchered three-hour version with good reason.  Be sure to scroll down to the DVD details to make sure you are getting the six-hour version.<br /><br />There is a Hindi version of this great epic, which was very popular in India, but it is extremely long, with many digressions that Western audiences will find distracting.  The Peter Brook version has been painstakingly translated and designed and made accessible to a modern Western audience, much the way Laurence Olivier did with his Shakespeare movies.<br /><br />For those with intelligence and sensibility -- i.e. for adults -- this is one of the most profound stories they will ever see.  For those without -- i.e. for adolescents -- it will be a bore.  The Mahabharata is longer than and as ancient as the Bible.  Some of the parallels between the two are too close to be mere coincidence: the Trinity, virgin birth, prophecy, someone who is born and raised like Moses but is given a different role to play by destiny.  The story of Krishna in the complete Mahabharata (not included in the Brook) even parallels that of Jesus.  It is no coincidence that both Krishna and Jesus are called "Lord".  Although the Mahabharata is indeed a "secular" history, it contains within it the most sacred of all Hindu texts, the Bhagavad Gita, with its universal precepts.<br /><br />This is the story upon which an entire civilization bases its culture.  For Peter Brook to bring its essence to a beautifully staged play is a stupendous achievement.  His eclectic casting may not be to everybody's liking, and sometimes the accents are a bit thick.  But the acting itself is fine.  By the way, the father of mankind is...the storyteller.<br /><br />See this.  It can change your life.
I went into this with some hesitation after reading the write ups as there seemed to be a bit of cultural polarization between the loved it- hated it groups. After seeing it for myself I think that this version of the great epic is a starting point that can be useful for beginners in their desire to find out more about this and other sacred texts from India and the East. I was thrilled by some aspects of this as it clarified a few points for me, but also disappointed with the extreme condensation of several of the salient points. Especially the pre-battle discussion between Arjuna and Krishna, which I had hoped would be more detailed than what was given. I understand that within the limitations of the single movie only so much can be covered. I do hope that some one undertakes a detailed documentary or miniseries to visualize this for those of us who lack the Hindi language skills. But still, I think this may serve well the purpose of introducing dedicated beginners in their desire to learn more about this amazing work.
This is the creation of the poem to engrave drama in the hearts of man, which culminates in the 18-day war between the noble Pandava princes and their scheming cousins, the Kaurava kings that decides the fate of mankind.<br /><br />We see how free will and fait can co-exist. Notice that Krishna has an agenda that may or may not be that of the other players in the game. Even in the 18-day war every rule is broken every value is destroyed, leaving no difference between whom is good or who is evil, who is an enemy or who is not. As Krishna does throughout the movie, we see that the only way the Pandava can win is to use any means.<br /><br />Peter Brook encapsulated the essence of the Mahabharata in a 9-hour play. Then the play was adapted to this six-hour visual media presentation. Visually and melodically stunning this presentation is so well presented that you hardly realize the effort that went into making this representation reflect the true Mahabharata.<br /><br />Mahabharata literally means Great (Maha) India (Bharat), yet its meaning is the story of mankind, as one would see that mankind started in India.<br /><br />There are other film and book versions of the story some better some not as good however this is a brilliant work and should not be missed.<br /><br />In book form, I suggest as a good starting place "Mahabharata" -The Acclaimed new rendering of an immortal epic of war and destiny. Retold by William Buck.<br /><br />Also, do not over look "The Power of Myth" -- by Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520227042">Mahabharata</a>
Poor quality VHS.  Topic is superb, acting was excellent and the overall production was terrific.  Just the quality of the video wasn't up to my expectations.
In India, folks will happily watch (if they can) 60 or more episodes of a traditional saga -- done in a single studio, with actors sitting on cardboard props against a blue screen -- and love every minute of it, because they already know the tales by heart and are entering into the celebration of them.  So how does one condense the longest epic poem in the world into a format that will be watched by Westerners with (comparatively) short attention spans?<br /><br />Yes, this DVD does presume some knowledge of the original; so if you don't know the story, get a Cliff's Notes or look it up on Wikipedia; your viewing will be a lot more pleasurable if you're not trying to figure out the plot as you go.  The delivery is in practically Shakespearean English, to give it the elevated sense the subject requires, and this may take some getting used to as well -- especially since the international cast, representing (visually) ALL of humanity -- can sometimes stumble on the delivery (I agree; subtitles would be a good idea).<br /><br />Overall, Brook and company have done an excellent job of capturing the essence of the epic Mahabharata, and bringing its central themes to a western audience -- albeit not via spoon feeding; the audience has to recognize the themes, as they're not presented overtly.  I've watched the DVD more than a dozen times, and never cease to be impressed with the depth and subtlety of the writing and direction.  In my book, it beats Bollywood any day, and makes a foreign masterpiece very accessible to us.

Written in India roughly 2,000 years ago, the Mahabharata is one of the world's great religious texts. It also may be the most outlandish soap opera ever, replete with gods siring mortals, polygamy, compulsive gambling, unrequited love, and a family feud on an awesome scale.<br /><br />At its heart, the epic poem of 100,000 verses tells the tale of two warring sets of royal cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who each seek to rule the kingdom. Around that rivalry is woven a wealth of philosophy, myth and history -- a virual encyclopedia of ancient Indian culture. Just one small part of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, the book that Hare Krishnas used to try to sell in airports around the world; it is a long discussion between the wise god Krishna and the soul-searching archer Arjuna (a Pandava), as the latter reluctantly prepares to enter into battle with his cousins.<br /><br />This six-hour adaptation of the Mahabharata has been crafted by two great film talents: screenwriter Jean Claude Carriere ("The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie") and director Peter Brook ("Marat-Sade"). They emphasize the universality of the mythic tale, and set it on a dream-like stage whose timeless backdrops are fog and mist, rocky slopes and reed thickets, and candlelit rooms. The movie's superb cast is drawn from every continent and racial group, thus adding a rather transcendent touch, as well as eliminating the thorny problem of the Indian caste system with one stroke.<br /><br />"The Mahabbarata" is both a compelling story and an enlightening spiritual journey, whether or not you've ever dipped a toe into the Ganges. It is not packed with filmic excitement, as it has the pacing and feel of a play (and indeed was adapted from Brook and Carriere's 1985 stage version), but it is full of marvelous acting, dialogue, music and cinematography. So sit back with some Darjeeling tea, and enjoy the interplay of gods and men.
Make no mistake; this is an abridged version of the original 1990 interpretation and in spite of this, I give it five stars. Peter Brook was the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company in London and of the International Centre for Theatre Research in Paris at the Bouffes du Nord. He has worked on many projects with Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re (President of the French School for Film and Television), who wrote a mini-script of The Mahabharata (Methuen Drama, 1988) that Brooks translated into English. The play came to New York in a nine-hour full stage version (Brooklyn Academy of Music, 1987); it was followed by a six-hour film version which was telecast in Europe in 1989 and by PBS in 1991and has become a DVD collectors' item; I hope that IMAGE will come again with the 285-minute version. Now there is this three-hour version, which was projected in the movie theatres in the mid-nineties. Fortunately, this version conserves intact the original section on the Bhagavad-Gita, and includes the original documentary on "the making of The Mahabharata" (54 min.) as a bonus, which deserves to be seen. The cast is composed of a selected group of 42 international actors (India, USA, Burkina-Faso, Japan, Vietnam, Italy, England, Senegal, ....etc.). The music was composed by Toshi Tsuchitori; the songs were interpreted by Sarmila Roy (there is a beautiful CD with the film music:[...].<br /><br />The Mahabharata is the longest poem ever written (three times as long as the Bible); it literally means ''the great story of the Bharatas,'' the legendary first king of India. Indian tradition says: "Everything in The Mahabharata is elsewhere; what is not there is nowhere". It begins when a young boy meets the author, the old poet Vyasa, who says that he is going to tell him the history of his ancestors ... the history of mankind: "if you listen carefully," he tells the boy, "at the end you will be someone else." Ganesh, who has a human body and an elephant head, becomes the poet's scribe.<br /><br />The first chapters tell us the origins of the human species, Vyasa's birth and other major events. But the story focuses on King Santanu's family and the competition between his great-grandchildren, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who are cousins, how they are growing up, how they are building their rivalries, and what kind of values, preferences and "life styles" they are developing. In a game of dice, the oldest brother of the Pandavas, Yudhishthira, loses everything, land, kingdom, brothers, and wife, against Shakuni (an in-law of the Kauravas) and goes into exile for 13years with his brothers and common wife. The Kauravas want to completely eliminate the Pandavas, but the Pandavas prefer a peaceful return. Both groups of cousins start a meticulous search for `pasupata', the `absolute weapon' (their version of Weapons of Mass Destruction -WMD), and war is inevitable. Krishna, the incarnation of Vishnu, tries to prevent the war between the cousin families. Being asked which side he will take, Krishna responds that if war takes place, his entire army can go to one group and himself to the other, but that he will not fight; Arjuna selects Krishna, who becomes his charioteer, and Duryodhana, the head of the Kauravas, chooses the army.<br /><br />The central part of the long poem is The Bhagavad-Gita. Before the titanic battle between the two armies, there is a long moment of suspense (time here becomes space). It seems that the entire poem is a long preparation for the The Gita, one the most precious gems of all the yoga texts.  It takes place just before the big battle between the cousins. This is a private long dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna, while the two armies are eager to start killing each other. Arjuna refuses to fight, and tells Krishna that the mind is capricious, evasive, turbulent, and tenacious.  Krishna reminds him about his Dharma (`duty') and says that inaction and retirement are not an option; he should act, but should act with detachment. Then, he teaches Arjuna yoga, as the discipline of liberation.  The Gita has been compared to the Sermon on the Mount and is considered the quintessential text of the Vedas. At the end of the war, everybody dies, one by one, and at the end of the poem, the last survivor, Yudhishthira, recognizes that all is illusion.
I first heard of the Mahabharata when I was reading reviews for the video of the play, Nicholas Nickleby. I was rather interested in it. I finally bought the DVD last year because I felt like I had to have it for some reason.<br /><br />It was worth every penny.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is perfect. The sets are gorgeous. I love all of the natural elements like water and rock and fire everywhere. And the sand is pretty cool too. Out of all of the performances, two of them are my absolute favorites, Mallika Sarabhai as Draupadi and Mamadou Dioume as Bhima. Had this play opened on Broadway, these two actors would have won Tonies for their parts. Peter Brook and Jean-Claude Carriere created an amazing piece for the stage and for film. There were some moments of the film where I just sat in silence spellbound. One example is when Krishna (wonderfully played by Bruce Meyers) stands above Arjuna (another great performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno) revealing his true form. The symbolic gestures are stunning and the special effects are enchanting without losing theatricality. Most of all is the overall message of the poem itself. The poem dares to explore all aspects of human life, something that epics like The Iliad or The Odyssey just don't do. Peter Brook is a theatrical genius.<br /><br />Especially informative is the behind the scenes featurette. It's fun to watch people hearing their views on doing the play and working with Peter. Mallika Sarabhai is even more likeable offscreen than on as we see when she's speaking in the documentary and offering insight on how The Mahabharata is not just religion but pop culture in India. I believe Yoshi Oida (the amazing actor who plays Drona) puts it perfectly about what The Mahabharata has to offer, "In (the) film, we are playing greater (people), greater than us. So, I feel that if I imitate (these people) every day, maybe I (will) become (a) greater person." Yoshi, I intend to do the same thing.
I rate this a 4 only because I haven't seen the DVD yet, but a friend once loaned me the VHS version. I think I watched it three times over the course of a couple months. In one case, I watched all 6 hours straight through (minus bathroom breaks of course). Another reviewer used the phrase &quot;life changing&quot;, and I agree completely. I have continued to draw inspiration from this film for 5 years. With the DVD, maybe I can go for another 50. PS: The soundtrack for this film is out on RealWorld. Also recommended.
Watch the making of, and you'll see director/co-writer Peter Brook speak about his contempt for actors who seek personal fame, when they should put their career-making egos aside and focus instead on the work itself... yet Brook's name appears in giant letters on the box, and in the USA the DVD is even listed not as 'The Mahabharata,' but 'Peter Brook's The Mahabharata.' What a tool!  Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re and Marie-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Estienne apparently spent 8 years co-writing the screenplay with Brook, yet their names do not appear on the DVD front cover at all.  The making-of documentary includes footage with actress Mallika Sarabhai saying of Brook: "I didn't like him when I met him first; I found him extremely rude." and "He can be very precise, and cutting, and hurtful... and sometimes very unreasonable."  Other actors hint at Brook's unprofessional and tiresome airs of self-importance, but seem too happy to be getting work to confront the guy signing their paychecks.<br /><br />Anyone with experience in the theater or art world will recognize the stereotype of the guy who tells himself "My success proves I'm superior to other people, so I am justified in treating them as beneath me."  Like so many famous artists, Peter Brook shows an above-average ability to communicate about grace in the abstract, but in his actual personal life is a graceless prick who mistreats the people around him.<br /><br />Brook's icky personality aside, this film is excellent.  The directing and camera-work are pedestrian; what makes this production sing is the fantastic cast (who say in interviews they create their own interpretations without input from Brook) and the genuine ingenuity in compressing all the most-crucial parts of the sweeping story into only 5 1/2 hours.  This is really a filmed stage play rather than a film, so be ready for slow, deliberate pacing and near-zero special effects.  I do wish Brook had been more faithful to the material and went with an all-Indian cast, rather than insisting on blemishing the material with his fingerprints by using an international cast (and the choice to not depict Krishna as blue-skinned is jarring and seems arbitrary).  Having said that, the actors are all wonderful and the effect is not as distracting as I'd feared.  This is the most accessible and truest-to-the-spirit version of the Mahabharata I've found in English, including B. R. Chopra's splashy television series and the strong but problematic prose translation by William Buck.<br /><br />As others mention, check the listing carefully and be sure to get the full 5 1/2 hour version.
I have watched this in PBS several years ago and have watched it repeatedly. From one context this seems "juvenile" and with a novice international cast. From another context it is a good short rendering of Mahabharata (mainly) for the western viewers who have not heard/read/wathced the epic hundreds of times in various ways (from grandmothers/grandfathers/Indian TV/Movies). I enjoyed watching this Peter Brook's version and the International cast and I some how liked the Duryodhana and Karna's character as they were more bubbly and the acting seemed more proficient. I just want to mention the typical Indian rendition of mythical stories in "Amar Chitra Katha" cartoon books where essence of lot of Indian Mythical stories are published in much shorter versions and I used to read them in my childhood. I would like to compare Peter Brooke's version to Amar Chitra Khatha equivalent (roughly!). I would recommend this Video to any one who wants to get introduced to this epic in a "lite hearted" manner.
There are two version of this stage production being offered here.  And although they are from the same production, the one that's titled "Peter Brook's The Mahabharata" is a 2 DVD set, over 315 minutes while the other one dated as "2008", is only 1 disk and 170 minutes.  The criticisms of the shorter version may be valid.<br />Amazon appears to be applying the reviews of the shorter one to both.<br />The longer version is much more complete and easier to follow, AND is very enjoyable.  It is easily FIVE STAR quality.<br />But the reality is that if the Mahabharata is presented quicker than maybe 2 months of straight delivery, it's abridged.
Peter Brook omitted very important parts of the story. As children, the Kauravas plotted to kill the Pandavas, by luring them into a lac house and burning it down.  The Pandavas and their mother escaped and wandered in the forest for many years.  Before this occurred, Duryodhan poisoned Bhima and threw him into the sea, where Bhima was rescued by underwater creatures.  The Kauravas were treacherous, and this has not been pointed out by Peter Brook. Showing these events could have taken perhaps another ten minutes of screen time. This is a distorted story. S.K.

Really impressed with this movie.  It was worth the money.  By watching the behind the feature, it really helped to understand the movie from beginning to end.  Looking forward to watching the movie a second time.
THE DVD I GOT IS NOT VERY GOOD, IT DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES AND THE IMAGE IS BLURRY, BUT IS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I TRIED TO GET THIS PRODUCT, SO I SHOULD BE GLAD YOU GOT IT FOR ME. THANK YOU, BEATRIZ BELTRAN.
This is the best adaptation of the Mahabharata ever that i have seen. It is definitely something to own.
Pours wisdom right into the soul.<br />It changed my life. The largest poem on Earth and it is about YOU! This 6 hour film is derived from the 9 hour stageplay.<br />Absolutely unique and tells you about the meaning of life.
I didn't realize how good 'Song of Norway' was until I watched this film, which is almost as bad as Gilliam's 'Jabberwocky'.  Peter Brook, like Terry Gilliam, is one of the great charlatans of our time.  Each man is a self-important destroyer of good literature.  Whatever Gilliam touches he turns into boring uncleanness.  Whatever Brook touches he turns into a model of his own ininteresting self.<br /><br />There is neither health nor beauty in Brook's 'Mahabharata'.  If you want to watch a proper 'Mahabarata', get the Chopra version.  Brook's 'international' version is squalid, boring, and all wrong.  It will be enjoyed only by the illiterate and the perverse.<br /><br />Let me say something in passing.  The RSC has been for at least three decades an example of all that is bad in the modern arts world.  When will British critics stop treating it as a divine manifestation?<br /><br />We British have suffered horribly at the hands of our home-grown 'talents' since the 1960s.  Some day we'll get a healthy-minded director who will make faithful films of the John Buchan novels.  Many of us are fed up with directors whose minds are unclean and utterly dull.  The duty of a film-maker is to enchant, to entertain: but Peter Brook has no sense of duty, and so his 'Mahabharata' has zero entertainment value.
In reading the positive reviews of the movie, I was wondering if one needed to take some kind of exotic drugs to write them, and then I wondered wouldn't it be easier just to take the drugs and forget the movie?<br /><br />Honestly, this one of the worst films I have ever seen since "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and the "Freddy Got Fingered." The production values were poor to say the least. It was hard to identify the the characters and their motivations because no one stands out. Most of the characters were pretty uninteresting or strange, i.e., the woman who gave birth to a bowling ball for example. [Seriously, it is in there. I'm not making it up.] I could not figure out the lineages of the families because they were a pretty mixed group. There was even a Kung Fu master in the film and that part was a bit like Kung Fu meets the Sons of Hercules. Which begs the question, if you are going to have a Kung Fu master why not attack helicopters and rocket grenades, too? Could any film be worse?<br /><br />No, actually -- this is pretty bad.<br /><br />It is like watching a bad Star Trek movie if you aren't a fan of Star Trek or familiar with the myth or back-story. One point the woman's future husband is blind so she chooses to wear a blindfold for the rest of her life. What that accomplishes I don't know but there it is.<br /><br />If you like really bad gladiator movies, this could be your film. Yikes!
I read on internet about this western version of Mahabharata and was curious to watch how Peter Brook captured it with his western mindset. After watching the movie on DVD which I bought, I was shocked and repented for buying it in first place. It was completely un-artistic and several incidents depicted in the movie are incorrect and the characters barring Draupadi  are hardly any reflection of the characters that Indians understand. Perhaps it is more apt to say that an average indian without knowledge of this movie wouldn't have guessed that he/she was watching Mahabharata. I am sure it's offensive to Hindu's faith, I think Mr.Brook should have limited his ambitions to produce simple stories rather than attempting to screen the greatest epic on earth with his limited understanding and parochial vision and in the process, reducing it to lower than street side drama. Suffice to say that the dramas played by primary school kids were several cuts above this movie. If I had an option, I would have given negative rating !
