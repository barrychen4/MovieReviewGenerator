A young couple wants to spice up their sex life until it results in someone's murder....<br />Nothing really too much to say about this story, except that it's probably already been done in any number of Shannon Tweed or Shannon Whirry films. I will say that it is different in that the female lead is a hot latina, which isn't common in this genre.<br /> Being unrated it does get somewhat kinky at times, but that is more dialogue-related than actual visuals. It's got a handful of decent sex scenes, but a comparatively little amount of nudity considering. I'd say for the price it's quite a good buy for the skin collector.<br />It's interesting to note that they're really pushing the fact that Mario Lopez is in this film, but the truth of the matter is that he is hardly in it at all. Even though his head fills up most of the cover, he barely even has a supporting role in this movie. Why they think that his name is a cash cow is beyond me, but he is technically the "biggest star" in it. Funny people, those Hollywood marketing "geniuses".
